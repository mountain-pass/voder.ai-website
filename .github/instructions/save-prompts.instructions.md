When I give you instructions for modifying how the user stories are managed, you need to document the updated requirement in #file:../../prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/001.0-PO-STORY-MANAGEMENT.md and, if needed, updated #file:../../prompt-assets/story-template.md accordingly.

This doesn't mean you should document issues found. Instead, you should document the expected behaviour of the user story management.

When creating or updating user stories, you MUST:

1. Ensure they conform to the established template in #file:../../prompt-assets/story-template.md
2. Follow the story management principles outlined in #file:../../prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/001.0-PO-STORY-MANAGEMENT.md
3. **ALWAYS update the corresponding user story maps** (business-user-story-map.md, developer-user-story-map.md, product-owner-user-story-map.md) to reflect any story additions, modifications, or removals
