## Risk Assessment

### ‚úÖ Low Risk Issues (Acceptable)
1. **Bundle Size Warning**: 511.10kB main bundle with optimization recommendations provided
2. **Safari Focus Behavior**: 6 accessibility test failures due to WebKit focus handling differences
3. **External Tool Vulnerabilities**: 2 low-severity issues in netlify-cli (development only)
4. **E2E Test Skips**: 35 development mode tests skipped (expected)

### üîç No Medium or High Risk Issues Identified

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Optional)
1. **Bundle Optimization**: Consider implementing code splitting for the Three.js bundle
