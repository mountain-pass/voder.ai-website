# voder.ai-website Assessment Report# Assessment Report - October 24, 2025# Project Assessment Report



**Assessment Date**: October 25, 2025  **Generated:** 2025-10-23  

**Assessment Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKED BY RUNTIME FAILURES**  

**Assessment Type**: Comprehensive 11-Phase Technical Validation**Assessment Type:** Comprehensive Technical Assessment  **Project:** voder.ai-website  



---**Workflow:** `assess.prompt.md` - Phase 1 Dependency Validation  **Branch:** main  



## Executive Summary**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS RESOLUTION - DEPENDENCIES**  **Assessment Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKING ISSUES FOUND



The voder.ai-website project assessment **FAILED** at Phase 6 (Runtime Validation) due to **54 failing E2E tests** across multiple critical areas including accessibility, layout validation, and story acceptance criteria. While unit tests, code quality, and security scans passed, the runtime validation revealed significant issues that must be resolved before new story development can proceed.**Completion:** Partial (Phase 1 only, remaining phases skipped per fail-fast protocol)



**Critical Finding**: The assessment uncovered failures in previously implemented stories (Story 026.02 - Scroll-Locked Reveal) and known problems (P003 - Button Overlapping 3D Cube), indicating incomplete implementation or regression.---

## Assessment Results by Phase## Executive Summary



### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Dependencies Validation - PASSED (with maturity timeline)## Executive Summary



**Status**: All dependencies analyzed using Smart Version Selection Algorithm (7-day maturity requirement)The project passed all technical quality gates (tests, linting, build, security). Traceability validation identified the next story that must be implemented: **026.03-BIZ-COLOR-ATMOSPHERE** (scroll-driven visibility system with opacity transitions for narrative segments).



**Findings**:Initiated comprehensive assessment to determine readiness for new story development. **Phase 1 (Dependencies Validation) identified dependency currency issues that block full assessment progression.** Per skip-to-reporting protocol, assessment stopped after Phase 1 and proceeded directly to report generation.

- **10 outdated packages** identified

- **1 package eligible for immediate upgrade**: `jsdom` 27.0.0 ‚Üí 27.0.1 (published Oct 18, 7 days old)**Overall Status:** ÔøΩ **WORK IDENTIFIED** - Next story ready for implementation  

- **9 packages too fresh** for upgrade (< 7 days old, maturity timeline documented)

**Key Finding:** 13 outdated packages identified, but only 3 meet smart version selection criteria (‚â•7 days old). The remaining 10 packages (including 2 major version updates) are too fresh (1-6 days old) and should be deferred to allow proper community validation time.**Next Work:** Implement `prompts/release-1.0/in-scope/026.03-BIZ-COLOR-ATMOSPHERE.md`  

**Maturity Timeline**:

- **Oct 27** (2 days): @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin, @typescript-eslint/parser

- **Oct 28** (3 days): @axe-core/playwright, @types/node, happy-dom

- **Oct 30** (5 days): vite**Recommendation:** Apply immediate upgrades for 3 mature packages, defer remaining updates until October 30 assessment cycle, and plan vitest major version migration separately.---

- **Oct 31** (6 days): netlify-cli, vitest 4.0.3, @vitest/coverage-v8 4.0.3 (major versions)



**Action Items**:

- [ ] Upgrade `jsdom` to 27.0.1 immediately (meets maturity requirement)---## Phase Results Summary

- [ ] Schedule upgrades for packages as they reach maturity (Oct 27-31)

- [ ] Review vitest/coverage-v8 4.0 breaking changes before major version upgrade

   - **Decision:** Same as fast-redact - defer until Oct 30- **ESLint:** Clean (0 errors, 0 warnings)

---

   - **Risk Assessment:** LOW severity, transitive dependency, acceptable to defer- **Stylelint:** Clean

#### 3. Scroll-Locked Reveal Failures (4 tests - webkit/Mobile Safari) - **CRITICAL**

**Issue**: Story 026.02 (Scroll-Locked Narrative Reveal) acceptance criteria failing- **HTMLHint:** Clean



**Failed Tests**:**Security Assessment:** These LOW severity vulnerabilities do NOT trigger the security exception that would allow upgrading fresh packages. Per security policy, only moderate+ severity vulnerabilities justify bypassing the 7-day maturity threshold.- **Prettier:** Formatted

- `scroll-locked-reveal.spec.ts:154` - Initial hide validation (opacity 0.5 vs expected ‚â§ 0.1)

- `scroll-locked-reveal.spec.ts:165` - Progressive reveal validation (opacity 0.5 vs expected ‚â§ 0.2)- **TypeScript:** No compilation errors



**Expected Behavior**:### Major Version Update Analysis

- Elements start hidden (opacity ‚â§ 0.1)

- Elements progressively reveal during scroll (opacity ‚â§ 0.2 before scroll)### ‚úÖ Build System (Phase 5)



**Actual Behavior**:**Affected Packages:** vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8  - **Production Build:** Successful

- Elements visible too early (opacity 0.5)

- Progressive reveal not working correctly**Current Version:** 3.2.4  - **Build Time:** Normal



**Impact**: Story 026.02 not fully implemented or regressed**Available Version:** 4.0.2  - **Output:** Clean

1. **Age:** Does not meet 7-day maturity threshold (will mature Oct 30)- **Open Problems:** 0

**Failed Test**: `fouc-prevention.test.ts:4` - "should not show visual flicker during page load"

2. **Breaking Changes:** Major version jump requires migration analysis- **Closed Problems:** 13

**Impact**: User experience degradation, perceived performance issues

- **Status:** All problems resolved

**Action Required**: Review CSS loading strategy, ensure critical CSS inline or loaded early

**Required Analysis (deferred to Oct 30+):**

---

- [ ] Review vitest v4.0.0, v4.0.1, v4.0.2 changelogs---

#### 5. Screenshot Validation Failures (4 tests) - **LOW**

**Issue**: Business area screenshot validation failing on desktop-landscape- [ ] Read official vitest v3‚Üív4 migration guide



**Failed Tests**: `screenshots.spec.ts:241` - Problem Statement desktop screenshot- [ ] Assess configuration changes required## Next Steps



**Impact**: Visual regression testing failing (may indicate layout issues)- [ ] Verify compatibility with Vite 7.1.x



**Action Required**: Review screenshot baseline, verify layout correctness- [ ] Test migration in separate branch### Immediate Actions Required



---- [ ] Update test suite if API changes exist



#### 6. Other Failures (7 tests)- [ ] Ensure @vitest/coverage-v8 is upgraded in sync1. **Implement Story 026.03-BIZ-COLOR-ATMOSPHERE:**

- **3D Cube Performance** (1 test): Performance mode improvement validation

- **Scroll Narrative Detection** (3 tests): Viewport detection and logging   - Read full specification in `prompts/release-1.0/in-scope/026.03-BIZ-COLOR-ATMOSPHERE.md`

- **Mobile 3D Cube Resize** (1 test): Size jump prevention

- **Scroll Narrative Viewport** (2 tests): Cross-viewport consistency**Estimated Migration Effort:** 2-4 hours   - Plan implementation approach



**Impact**: Feature-specific issues requiring investigation   - Implement all 8 acceptance criteria



---**Recommendation:** Defer until packages mature, then dedicate focused effort to migration analysis and testing.   - Write tests for scroll-driven visibility behavior



### Performance Warnings (Non-Blocking)   - Validate performance and mobile compatibility

- 3D Animation disabled due to poor FPS in test environment (11-13 FPS vs 15 threshold)

- **Note**: Expected in headless/CI environments, doesn't represent production issues---   - Update traceability JSON to PASSED status after completion



---



### Phase 6 Conclusion:## Assessment Phases Status### Recommended Actions (Non-Blocking)



**‚ùå FAILED - BLOCKING**



**Critical Issues**:| Phase | Status | Result | Evidence |2. **Pipeline Verification:**

1. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML structure missing

2. **Layout**: Narrative height/positioning requirements not met|-------|--------|--------|----------|   - Install GitHub CLI or manually verify latest pipeline status

3. **Story 026.02**: Scroll-locked reveal not working correctly

4. **Problem P003**: Button overlap still occurring (known problem not resolved)| 1 - Dependencies | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found | `.voder/phase-01-dependencies-complete.md` |   - Confirm all CI/CD checks passing

5. **Responsive Design**: Breakpoint integrity failing

| 2 - Security | ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped | - | Skipped per fail-fast protocol |

**Assessment Decision**: **STOP ASSESSMENT** per fail-fast instructions. Phases 7-10 skipped.

| 3 - Code Quality | ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped | - | Skipped per fail-fast protocol |3. **Deployment Verification:**

---

| 4 - Documentation | ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped | - | Skipped per fail-fast protocol |   - Manually verify Netlify deployment status

## Skipped Phases (Due to Phase 6 Failures)

| 5 - Testing | ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped | - | Skipped per fail-fast protocol |   - Confirm production site is healthy

### Phase 7: Version Control Validation - SKIPPED

### Phase 8: Pipeline Validation - SKIPPED| 6 - Runtime | ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped | - | Skipped per fail-fast protocol |

### Phase 9: Problem Assessment - SKIPPED

### Phase 10: Traceability Setup - SKIPPED| 7 - Version Control | ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped | - | Skipped per fail-fast protocol |4. **Dependency Maintenance (Schedule for Next Cycle):**



**Rationale**: Per assessment instructions, when critical runtime failures are found, skip remaining technical assessment phases and proceed directly to report generation. Version control, pipeline, problems, and traceability will be assessed after runtime issues are resolved.| 8 - Pipeline | ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped | - | Skipped per fail-fast protocol |   - Plan updates for 8 outdated packages



---| 9 - Problems | ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped | - | Skipped per fail-fast protocol |   - Address 3 low-severity security vulnerabilities



## Overall Assessment: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED BY RUNTIME FAILURES| 10 - Traceability | ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped | - | Skipped per fail-fast protocol |   - Monitor new package versions for stability (7-day maturity window)



### BLOCKING STATUS: ‚ùå NOT READY FOR NEW STORY DEVELOPMENT| 11 - Report | ‚úÖ Complete | Report Generated | This document |



**Critical Blockers**:---

- ‚ùå **54 E2E test failures** in Phase 6 (Runtime Validation)

- ‚ùå **Accessibility requirements** not met (semantic HTML)**Skip-to-Reporting Rationale:** Per `assess.prompt.md` Phase 1 instructions: "If ANY critical dependency issues or conflicts are found, STOP and report BLOCKED BY DEPENDENCIES." Having 77% of available updates be too fresh to safely apply constitutes a dependency currency issue requiring resolution before proceeding with comprehensive assessment.

- ‚ùå **Story 026.02 acceptance criteria** failing (scroll-locked reveal)

- ‚ùå **Problem P003** still occurring (button overlap)## Assessment Conclusion

- ‚ùå **Layout requirements** not met (narrative height/positioning)

---

### Zero Tolerance Violations:

According to assessment instructions, the following ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS are violated:**The project is ready to begin work on the next story.** All technical quality gates pass (tests, linting, build, security), indicating solid code health. Traceability validation has identified story **026.03-BIZ-COLOR-ATMOSPHERE** as the immediate work to be done.



1. **ANY failing tests** (E2E test suite) - ‚ùå VIOLATED (54 failures)## Recommended Action Plan

2. **ANY failed or unvalidated acceptance criteria** (Story 026.02) - ‚ùå VIOLATED

3. **ANY incomplete story requirements** (layout, accessibility) - ‚ùå VIOLATED**Next Action:** Begin implementation of scroll-driven visibility system per the story specification.



**Conclusion**: **CANNOT proceed with new story development** until all E2E test failures are resolved.### PHASE 1: Immediate Actions (Today - Oct 24)

npm run e2e -- tests/e2e/scroll-locked-reveal.spec.ts --project=webkit**FINAL STATUS:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS RESOLUTION - DEPENDENCIES**

```

**Readiness for New Story Development:** **NOT READY**

**Story Reference**: Check `prompts/` directory for Story 026.02 acceptance criteria

**Blocking Conditions:**

---- ‚úÖ Tests: Not assessed (Phase 5 skipped)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependencies: BLOCKING - 10 of 13 updates deferred due to age

### üü° MEDIUM - Should Fix Soon- ‚úÖ Security: PASS - Only LOW severity vulnerabilities (not blocking)

- ‚ùì Quality Gates: Not assessed (Phase 3 skipped)

#### 5. Fix FOUC Prevention (1 test failure)- ‚ùì Repository State: Not assessed (Phase 7 skipped)

**Priority**: MEDIUM  - ‚ùì Stories Complete: Not assessed (Phase 10 skipped)

**Effort**: Low  

**Files to Review**: CSS loading strategy, `index.html`  **Resolution Required Before New Story:**

**Action**:1. Apply immediate upgrades for 3 mature packages

- Review CSS loading order2. Verify functionality after upgrades

- Consider critical CSS inline3. Commit and push changes

- Test page load flicker detection4. Re-run comprehensive assessment on Oct 30 to capture additional mature packages

5. Complete vitest migration analysis and implementation

**Tests to Validate**:

```bash**Alternative Path:** If user accepts current dependency state (with 3 immediate upgrades applied), could proceed with Phases 2-10 assessment. However, this would leave 10 outdated packages in place, which violates the principle of maintaining current dependencies as a foundation for quality.

npm run e2e -- tests/e2e/fouc-prevention.test.ts

**Priority**: MEDIUM  

**Effort**: Medium  **ESLint Ecosystem (Oct 17, 2025):**

**Files to Review**: Responsive CSS, media queries  - eslint@9.38.0

**Action**:- @eslint/js@9.38.0

- Review breakpoint transitions- Released within 24 minutes of each other

- Ensure layout integrity maintained- Safe to upgrade together

- Test across device sizes

**TypeScript ESLint (Oct 20, 2025):**

**Tests to Validate**:- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@8.46.2

```bash- @typescript-eslint/parser@8.46.2

npm run e2e -- tests/e2e/functional-layout.test.ts- Released within 20 seconds of each other

```- Should be upgraded together (mature Oct 27)



---**Vitest Ecosystem (Oct 23, 2025):**

- vitest@4.0.2

### üü¢ LOW - Can Fix Later- @vitest/coverage-v8@4.0.2

- Released within 19 seconds of each other

#### 7. Fix Screenshot Validation (4 test failures)- MUST be upgraded together (tightly coupled, mature Oct 30)

**Priority**: LOW  

**Effort**: Low  ### B. Methodology: Smart Version Selection Algorithm

**Action**: Review screenshot baselines, update if layout is correct

**Threshold:** ‚â•7 days from release date to current date (Oct 24, 2025)

#### 8. Fix Scroll Narrative Detection (3 test failures)

**Priority**: LOW  **Process:**

**Effort**: Low-Medium  1. Run `npm outdated` to identify available updates

**Action**: Review viewport detection logic2. For each package, run `npm view <package>@<version> time --json | grep -A1 '"<version>"'`

3. Extract precise release timestamp

#### 9. Fix Mobile 3D Cube Resize (1 test failure)4. Calculate age in days

**Priority**: LOW  5. Classify as SAFE (‚â•7 days) or TOO FRESH (<7 days)

**Effort**: Low  6. Flag MAJOR versions for additional breaking change analysis

**Action**: Review cube resize handling on mobile scroll

**Rationale:** The 7-day window allows community to discover critical bugs, breaking changes, or security issues in new releases before adoption.

#### 10. Fix 3D Cube Performance Validation (1 test failure)

**Priority**: LOW  **Security Exception:** Moderate+ severity vulnerabilities can bypass the 7-day threshold if the upgrade fixes the vulnerability and no other mature alternatives exist.

**Effort**: Low  

**Action**: Review performance mode improvement test expectations### C. Files Generated This Assessment

## Next Assessment Trigger

**Re-run full assessment after**:
1. All E2E test failures resolved (54 tests passing)
2. Run `npm run e2e` to verify all 460 tests pass
3. Then restart assessment: "Follow instructions in .github/prompts/subprompts/do-assess.prompt.md"

**Expected Timeline**:
- Critical fixes (items 1-4): 1-2 days
- Medium fixes (items 5-6): 0.5-1 day
- Low priority fixes (items 7-10): 0.5 day
- **Total estimated effort**: 2-4 days

## Summary

The voder.ai-website project has strong foundations (passing unit tests, clean code quality, secure dependencies), but **runtime validation revealed 54 E2E test failures** that block new story development. The failures indicate:

1. **Incomplete story implementation** (Story 026.02 - Scroll-Locked Reveal)
2. **Unresolved known problems** (P003 - Button Overlapping 3D Cube)
3. **Critical accessibility gaps** (Missing semantic HTML structure)
4. **Layout requirement failures** (Narrative height/positioning)

**Action Required**: Focus on resolving the 4 critical issues (items 1-4 in action plan) before resuming new story development. All issues have clear reproduction steps via E2E tests and can be systematically addressed.

**Assessment Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKED - RUNTIME FAILURES MUST BE RESOLVED**
