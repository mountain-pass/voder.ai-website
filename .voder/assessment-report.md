## Next Story To Implement

### üéØ WORK NOW: 026.03-BIZ-COLOR-ATMOSPHERE

**Story:** `prompts/release-1.0/in-scope/026.03-BIZ-COLOR-ATMOSPHERE.md`

**Status:** NOT YET IMPLEMENTED (first unimplemented story found in traceability validation)

**Description:** Implement scroll-driven visibility system with opacity transitions for narrative segments

**Acceptance Criteria (8 items - all unimplemented):**
1. **Scroll-Driven Visibility** - NOT_IMPLEMENTED
2. **Smooth Opacity Transitions** - NOT_IMPLEMENTED
3. **Accurate Timing** - NOT_IMPLEMENTED
4. **Bidirectional Scrolling** - NOT_IMPLEMENTED
5. **Initial State** - NOT_IMPLEMENTED
6. **Clean Transitions** - NOT_IMPLEMENTED
7. **Performance Optimized** - NOT_IMPLEMENTED
8. **Mobile Compatible** - NOT_IMPLEMENTED

**Why This Story:** Traceability validation processes stories in reverse order (highest to lowest). This is the first story found with FAILED status, meaning it's the immediate work that must be completed before proceeding to earlier stories or new backlog items.

**Action Required:** Begin implementation of this story following the requirements and acceptance criteria in the specification file
