## NOW

Update `.gitignore` to ignore all build artifacts and logs in one go. For example, add these entries:

```
# build/output
dist/
outputs/

# CI caches and reports
.lighthouseci/

# logs and temp files
*.log
preview.log
dev.log
dev-server.log
e2e-output.log
e2e-results.log
```

## NEXT

- Add IDE/editor and OS files to `.gitignore` (e.g. `.vscode/`, `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`).
- Ignore Voder metadata directory (`.voder/`) to keep plan and history files out of Git.
- Review and remove any other large autogenerated assets that should not be versioned.

## LATER

- Periodically audit new files against ignore rules to prevent oversize commits.
- Consider moving large mockups or `.glb` assets into a CDN or external storage if they grow further.
- Refine ignore patterns as the projectâ€™s tooling and directory layout evolve.
