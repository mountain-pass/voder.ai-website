Here’s a streamlined history of what’s been done so far:

1. Project setup  
   • Initialized a static, ESM-only SvelteKit app with SSR disabled and migrated to TypeScript  
   • Replaced Reveal.js slides with GSAP/ScrollTrigger animations and added responsive dark mode  

2. Testing & CI  
   • Added cross-browser Playwright E2E tests (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)  
   • Organized GitHub Actions into Build, Preview, and Test jobs, achieving 18 reliable test passes  

3. Dependency audit & upgrades  
   • Reviewed ~134 packages, patched 17 vulnerabilities  
   • Upgraded Vite, Svelte, SvelteKit; reprovisioned @threlte/core; pinned key dependencies  
   • Fixed dev-server errors and restored nine broken E2E tests  

4. Performance & demos  
   • Optimized CSS delivery and deferred GSAP loading  
   • Built two Threlte demos: scroll-triggered hexagon fades and a full-viewport Three.js/Threlte scene  

5. Configuration, docs & cleanup  
   • Regenerated and tightened configs (svelte.config.js, tsconfig.json, vite.config.js)  
   • Streamlined imports, added an SVG flow diagram to the README  
   • Created HeroSection and StarfieldBackground components with ARIA roles and removed legacy code  

6. CI artifacts & verification  
   • Produced SSR and client bundles (~444 modules) and served the site on port 4173  
   • Configured Playwright full-page screenshots and documented artifact locations  
   • Updated “Available Scripts” in README (including npm run test:e2e) and verified via grep  

7. Most recent developments  
   • Updated project-root package.json with final scripts, dependencies, and engine versions  
   • Ran npm run test:ci (build → preview → test:e2e): all 18 Playwright tests passed in ~10.5 s  
   • Committed 25 files changed (510 insertions, 343 deletions)  
   • Then committed .voder/history.md and .voder/plan.md (2 files changed, 54 insertions, 71 deletions)

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Ensure you’re in the project root, then run:

  git add .voder/history.md
---

**This was the result:**
---
`git add .voder/history.md` completed.
Output:
