Here’s a concise, chronological summary of what’s been done so far:

• Bootstrapped a Vite-based ESM npm package  
  – Configured build/dev/preview/test scripts, added a neon-terminal demo, captured bundle-size and timing benchmarks.  
• Introduced Playwright smoke tests  
  – Set up build → preview → E2E in GitHub Actions, published a status badge, and documented three ADRs.  
• Overhauled project structure and docs  
  – Removed legacy files; revamped README with styling guidelines, global-styles snippets, auto-injected breakpoints; tweaked CSS accents and media queries.  
• Built responsive-design tests  
  – Added tests (tests/responsive.spec.js) for container padding and heading sizes at 640×800 and 1024×768, captured screenshots, ran CI with a background server.  
• Integrated Reveal.js slides  
  – Installed Reveal.js, updated index.html, wrote init code, authored four sample slides.  
• Performed general code cleanup  
  – Removed unused root <div>, stray scripts/servers, and deleted src/main.js.  
• Stabilized and expanded smoke-test coverage  
  – Replaced a flaky SVG assertion; added checks for hero <h1>, meta tags, text blocks, SVG count, effects, OG image, document title/metadata, and footer.  
• Achieved consistently green CI with nine E2E smoke tests (with retries).  
• Added navigation tests  
  – Verified keyboard navigation, deep-linking via slide hashes, improved URL assertions in tests/navigation.spec.js.  
• Ran the full CI/E2E suite  
  – 15 Playwright tests across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, all passing in ~10–12 s.  
• Updated documentation  
  – Expanded the README’s E2E section with navigation details; created adr-0004-use-revealjs.md.  
• Final cleanup and commit  
  – 22 files changed (776 insertions, 367 deletions); added new ADRs/tests; removed src/main.js.  
• Removed log and output files  
  – Deleted dev-server.log, npm-run-dev.log, npm-start.log, server.log, test-ci-output.txt, test_ci_output.txt.  
• Updated .gitignore  
  – Stripped references to old logs/output files; added an “outputs/” entry.  
• Modified README’s Project Structure  
  – Removed log/output entries; inserted “├── outputs  # Generated artifacts (e.g., screenshots, logs)” at the root level.  
• Most recently, created an empty “outputs” directory at the project root.
