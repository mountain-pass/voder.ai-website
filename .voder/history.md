Here’s a concise history of what’s been done so far:

• Project setup: initialized an ESM npm package with Vite (build/dev/preview/test), added a neon-terminal demo plus bundle-size and timing benchmarks.  
• Testing & CI: introduced Playwright smoke tests (mobile/tablet) and a full E2E suite on Chromium, Firefox, WebKit; configured a GitHub Actions pipeline and documented decisions in ADR-0001 through ADR-0004.  
• Cleanup & docs: removed legacy files, tightened .gitignore, cleaned up markup, and expanded the README with styling guidelines, breakpoints, global styles, CSS snippets, navigation and E2E instructions.  
• Reveal.js integration: installed Reveal.js, created sample slides, patched local bundling, and extended E2E checks (headers, meta/OG tags, content blocks, SVG counts, footer, visual effects), growing the suite from 15 to 18 tests.  
• Performance & metrics: production builds now take ~250–289 ms; CI installs 85 packages in 10–12 s with zero vulnerabilities; E2E suite runs in ~8.8–13.2 s; gzip bundle size ~2.85 KB.  
• Final tweaks: removed external CDN refs, added a console-error smoke test, fixed “OK is not defined,” enabled on-failure screenshots and trace retention, and resolved stray servers and git-add issues.  
• CI & npm checks: `npm ci` installs exactly 85 packages (0 vulnerabilities); `npm run test:ci` builds production, serves preview, and runs 18 passing E2E tests across three browsers.  
• Test enhancements: updated smoke/console tests for full-page screenshots with dynamic names, added steps for keyboard navigation and deep linking, and standardized folder structure.  
• Recent commits and results: commit b71c546 added tests/console.spec.js (138 insertions, 83 deletions); current `npm run test:ci` build in 268 ms, 18 tests in ~10.8 s, and screenshots under outputs/screenshots/; `npm ci` clean in ~2 s, audits 86 packages, 0 vulnerabilities.  
• Dev server and E2E verification: `npm run dev` launches Vite at http://localhost:4173 with no errors; latest E2E run passed all 18 tests across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit in ~10.7 s.  
• Most recent commit (15ba66c → b197309): recorded local edits in history and plan files (.voder/history.md, .voder/plan.md, prompts/development-guidelines.md, prompts/voder-website.md), totaling 4 files changed with 54 insertions and 69 deletions (followed by a further 44-line reduction in the final commit).
