Here’s a concise chronicle of what’s been done so far:

• Bootstrapped a SvelteKit ESM app (static build, SSR off) and fixed initial build errors  
• Migrated Playwright tests to ESM and set up GitHub Actions for preview deployments plus Chromium/Firefox/WebKit E2E runs  
• Replaced Reveal.js with GSAP / ScrollTrigger via an `animateSlide` helper, added responsive dark-mode and dynamic plugin loading, removed legacy selectors/tests  
• Adopted TypeScript; audited ~128 dependencies, patched 11 security issues; upgraded Vite, Svelte, SvelteKit and adapter-static; applied ~1,000 updates; dropped `@threlte/core`  
• Eliminated all dev-server errors and prod-build warnings; fixed nine failing E2E tests so CI now passes on all three browsers  
• Refined CSS/preprocessor setup; optimized async GSAP imports; experimented with Three.js and added a Threlte `<Canvas>` hexagon demo  
• Extracted “The Problem” and “GPS vs Directions” into standalone Svelte components and integrated them into the main page  
• Scoped scroll initialization to `[data-scroll-section]` and created four fade-in scroll sections (`HowItWorks`, `PromptIteration`, `Outcome`, `ClosingMoment`)  
• Refactored the BrandEntry route: full-viewport `<section>`, disabled SSR, dynamic `useFrame` import in `onMount`, route-specific CSS; updated Playwright’s server command  
• Swapped out the old BrandEntry scene for a Threlte-based rotating hexagon with ambient and directional lights  
• Moved ADR-0005 (adopt Threlte/Three) from “proposed” to “accepted” and removed the obsolete `e2e-test-results.log`  
• Ran `npm run sync` & `npm run build` to regenerate client/server bundles and produce a static `build/` output  
• Executed `npm run test:ci`: built the project, launched a preview server, ran 15 Playwright tests across three browsers—100% passed  
• Relocated `export const ssr = false` into `src/routes/brandentry/+page.server.ts` and removed the module-script block from `+page.svelte`  
• Performed final builds without errors or warnings; produced output under `.svelte-kit/output` and `build/`  
• Updated `README.md` with BrandEntry demo instructions; repeated CI runs (sync, build, preview, 15 E2E tests)—all passed on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit  
• Enhanced `src/app.css` with a navy–black gradient, starfield background, and Earth-horizon graphic; verified successful builds and E2E passes  
• Created `src/lib/assets/flow.svg` and updated `HowItWorksSection.svelte` to import and render it via `<img>` (verified on dev server)  
• Modified `tests/smoke.spec.js` to replace the old SVG-text locator with a new image-alt check; file generation succeeded  
• Ran `npm run test:ci` in the project root, which timed out after 60 seconds  
• Most recently edited `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: removed the single “Run CI pipeline” step and replaced it with separate “Build,” “Start Preview Server,” and “Run E2E tests” steps—file regenerated successfully.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Open a terminal in the project root and run these commands in order:

1. Stage the updated workflow file:
```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

2. Create a descriptive commit:
```bash
git commit -m "Update CI workflow: replace npm run test:ci with build, preview, test:e2e steps"
```

3. Push the new commit to the remote main branch:
```bash
git push origin main
```
---

**This was the result:**
---
`git add .github/workflows/ci.yml` completed.
Output:
