Here’s a concise history of what’s been done so far:

• Scaffolding & Initial Setup  
  – Initialized a Vite-based ESM npm package with dev/build/preview/test scripts  
  – Created a neon-terminal SVG-animated index.html and cleared console errors  

• Build Optimization & Metrics  
  – Minified HTML/CSS/JS for production  
  – Measured full builds (~45–65 ms), incremental rebuilds (~58–66 ms)  
  – Confirmed < 2 KB total gzipped output; tracked E2E durations (~424–986 ms)  

• Testing & CI Configuration  
  – Added Playwright Chromium smoke tests (including HTTP 200 OG-image check)  
  – Set up GitHub Actions workflow (Node 18 → npm ci → build → preview → E2E) with CI badge  

• Content Cleanup & Updates  
  – Drafted README.md; removed logs, debug statements, orphan files, .DS_Store  
  – Reorganized assets; generated preview.png  
  – Updated hero text, “Our Why Philosophy,” SVG copy, meta description; fixed <h1> mismatch; refined .gitignore  

• Builds & Preview Server Management  
  – Ran npm ci (18 packages, 0 vulnerabilities); repeated fast builds (HTML 0.43 KB, CSS 0.88 KB, JS 1.62 KB gzip)  
  – Started/stopped preview servers on ports 5173/4173; cleaned up stray processes  

• End-to-End Verification  
  – Executed npm run test:e2e; Playwright smoke test passed (1 test ~424 ms; total ~1.9 s)  

• Most Recent Build Metrics  
  – npm run build in 58 ms; output: dist/index.html (0.43 KB gzip), CSS (0.88 KB), JS (1.62 KB)  

• CI/Test Enhancements & Simplification  
  – Installed start-server-and-test; added “test:ci” script (build + preview + E2E)  
  – Ran npm run test:ci locally; pipeline completed without errors  
  – Simplified .github/workflows/ci.yml to a single “Run CI pipeline” step  
  – Updated README “## Tests” section to use npm run test:ci  

• Cleanup  
  – Deleted ci-output.log from project root  
  – Most recently ran `rm -rf test-results/`, removing the test-results/ directory and its contents

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Edit the file README.md at the project root (./README.md). Locate the section starting with the heading:

```
## Build & Preview
```

Directly beneath that heading you’ll see the two-step instructions (e.g. `npm run build` then `npm run preview`). Remove those lines entirely and replace them with exactly this single line:

```
Run `npm run test:ci` to build the site, start a preview server, and execute end-to-end tests in one command.
```
