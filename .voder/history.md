18. Latest Code Change Applied  
    • Wrapped that `<pre>` in an `aria-live="polite"` container in PromptIterationSection.ts  

19. Latest CI Test Suite Run  
    • Re-ran `npm run test:ci`: build succeeded; same 51/54 Playwright tests passing  

20. Latest CSS Patch Applied  
    • In `src/style.css`, removed duplicated  
      `section[aria-labelledby="prompt-iteration-heading"] { … }` block and duplicate `:root { … }`
