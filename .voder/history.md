- Repository & tooling
  - Established a monorepo with locked deps, Husky hooks and Vite theming.
  - Integrated Playwright‑Axe for accessibility checks and Lighthouse CI for performance audits.

- Performance & accessibility work
  - Inlined critical CSS, pruned unused styles, fixed TypeScript errors.
  - Added prefers-reduced-motion support and eliminated most Axe violations.

- 3D, animations & runtime
  - Lazy‑loaded Three.js, GSAP and ScrollTrigger with reduced‑motion honoring.
  - Patched GSAP runtime typings/syntax, stubbed THREE/GSAP globals and statically rendered key sections.

- Testing & CI/CD
  - Wrote 42 cross‑browser E2E tests and 15 Chrome‑only specs.
  - Configured GitHub Actions for unit tests, visual‑regression, Lighthouse audits and preview deploys.
  - Created visual‑screenshots.spec.ts to capture section/transition states across viewports/browsers.

- Build & bundle optimizations
  - Removed excess CSS, split vendor chunks, enabled gzip and Draco compression.
  - Reduced build times and TTI; shipped ~250 gzipped modules and documented tsc + Vite build metrics.

- Metrics, docs & security
  - Added Lighthouse assertions, bundle‑size logging, social/meta tags, ADRs and custom Vite lint rules.
  - Upgraded packages and remediated multiple vulnerabilities found in audits.

- Styling & ARIA fixes
  - Unified color variables, scoped component styles, externalized Sentry config.
  - Patched five components for ARIA compliance, fixed live regions and search accessibility.
  - Applied multiple CSS patches (including high‑contrast rules) and removed duplicated rules in src/style.css.

- Plugin & config cleanup
  - Removed obsolete devDependencies, refactored vite.config.ts and tuned esbuild options.

- Scroll‑based transitions & accessibility
  - Built an accessible multi‑phase scroll flow (BrandEntry → TheWhy → OutcomeFocus → ClosingMoment) with ARIA announcements, skip‑links, test hooks and full Playwright coverage.
  - Patched TransitionController.init() to register a global Escape listener for skip().

- Final build/runtime tweaks
  - Removed liveRegionSelector, removed duplicate TransitionController init, silenced TS6133 warnings, freed a conflicting port and patched miscellaneous flow configs.

- Verification & test runs
  - Multiple Playwright CI runs with varying results: initial run 45 passing; later runs 51/54 passing (three color‑contrast failures).
  - Targeted runs passed 81 tests across Chrome/Firefox/Safari for 3D and Vision Flow features; subsequent re‑runs reverted to 51/54.
  - Tracked specific color‑contrast issues; one involved a <pre> later wrapped in an aria‑live container.

- BrandEntry3D enhancements
  - Implemented eight major improvements: ignition pulse scaling, volumetric beam reveal, optimized atmospheric particles with quality‑based update frequencies, multi‑layer breathing rotations, advanced lighting with quality‑based shadow mapping, choreographed 6s sequence timing, atmospheric complexity layers, and device‑specific quality presets.
  - Added detectQualityPreset() to detect GPU/device capability.

- Quality‑based performance tuning
  - Implemented presets affecting particle counts (~440/220/110+), update frequencies, shadow‑map sizes and graceful degradation; logged detected presets to console.

- Vision Flow & animated schematic
  - Implemented HowItWorksSection and VisionFlowAnimatedSchematic: a 3.5s choreographed animation (6 phases), interactive SVG nodes, sequential stroke animations, path morphing (GPS → schematic), tooltips, keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, live regions and reduced‑motion fallbacks.
  - Vision Flow tests passed across Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

- Animation & visual test infrastructure
  - Enhanced animation‑utils.ts and GSAP typings; added data‑animating/data‑initial‑animation‑complete checks and fallback logic.

- Development guidelines & prompt‑engineering infra
  - Updated prompts/guidelines.md with visual assessment requirements; added .github prompts for progress and history.
  - Excluded screenshots/ from VCS and created implementation‑progress.md documenting ~65–70% compliance with section evidence.

- Live Prompt Interaction system
  - Built LivePromptInteraction.ts (545 lines) and live‑prompt‑interaction.css (403 lines) to replace static mockups with a dynamic demo (automatic cycling, hover reveals, GSAP morphing, split‑screen layout).
  - Integrated into PromptIterationSection with test‑env detection and accessibility features (ARIA live regions, skip links, keyboard navigation).

- Live prompt testing & accessibility fixes
  - Updated prompt‑iteration.spec.ts, removed role="img" from interactive elements, adjusted selectors and cleaned backup tests.
  - Achieved 100% test pass rate (35/35) across browsers for the Live Prompt Interaction System; Axe scans passed for that system.

- Recent patches and current state
  - Wrapped a problematic <pre class="prompt-content"> in an aria‑live="polite" container, removed duplicate CSS blocks and applied the latest high‑contrast CSS patch.
  - CI runs continue to show the varying Playwright pass counts noted above; the single earlier Axe color‑contrast violation on that <pre> was addressed by the live‑region wrap.

- Most recent package/install activity
  - Ran npm ci in project root; install completed, adding 662 packages and auditing 686 packages in ~8s.
  - Reported 0 vulnerabilities and 243 packages looking for funding; package‑lock.json and node_modules/ produced.

- Most recent repository inspections & file/tool actions
  - Read/checked package.json, .gitignore, postcss.config.ts, htmlhint.config.js(.cjs), README.md, various lint/config files and CI workflow.
  - Verified scripts/prepare‑libraries.js exists and generated it; added a "prepare" script to package.json and overwrote package.json with current content.
  - Ran repository tooling commands (find_files, search_file_content, read_file, check_file_exists, generate_file, modify_file); tools reported "Action completed successfully."

- Most recent executed actions (tool log)
  - Ran list_directory, read_file on package.json, src/main.ts, tests/setup.ts, .github/workflows/ci.yml, vitest and testing config files, README.md, package‑lock.json, tests/main.test.ts, and scripts/prepare‑libraries.js; checked file existence for various test and script files.
  - Final tool run reported: "Action completed successfully."
