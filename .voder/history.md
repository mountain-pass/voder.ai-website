Here’s a condensed recap of what’s been done so far in the project:

• Project Setup  
  – Bootstrapped an ESM npm package with Vite (build/dev/preview/test scripts)  
  – Added a neon-terminal demo plus bundle-size and timing benchmarks  

• Testing & CI  
  – Introduced Playwright smoke tests (mobile/tablet) and a full E2E suite on Chromium, Firefox, WebKit  
  – Configured GitHub Actions (build → preview → E2E) and documented decisions in ADR-0001 to ADR-0004  

• Cleanup & Docs  
  – Removed legacy files, tightened .gitignore, cleaned up markup  
  – Expanded README with styling guidelines, breakpoints, global styles, CSS snippets, navigation and E2E instructions  

• Reveal.js Integration & E2E Expansion  
  – Installed Reveal.js, created sample slides, patched local bundling  
  – Pruned unused markup and flaky assertions; added checks for headers, meta/OG tags, content blocks, SVG counts, footer, visual effects  
  – Stabilized tests (retries) and grew the suite from 15 to 18 E2E tests  

• Performance & Metrics  
  – Production builds in ~250–289 ms; CI installs 85 packages in 10–12 s with zero vulnerabilities  
  – E2E suite runs in ~8.8–13.2 s; preview servers on ports 4173–4179; gzip bundle ~2.85 KB  

• Final Verifications & Tweaks  
  – Removed external CDN references; added console-error smoke test; fixed an “OK is not defined” error  
  – Enabled on-failure screenshots and trace retention; updated .gitignore; resolved stray servers and git-add issues  

• CI & npm Checks  
  – `npm ci` installs exactly 85 packages, audits zero vulnerabilities  
  – `npm run test:ci` builds production, serves a preview, and runs 18 passing E2E tests across three browsers  

• Test Enhancements & Structure  
  – Updated smoke and console tests for full-page screenshots with dynamic names  
  – Added screenshot steps for keyboard navigation and deep linking; standardized screenshot folders; removed old structure  

• Recent Commits & Results  
  – Commit b71c546: 138 insertions, 83 deletions; added tests/console.spec.js  
  – `npm run test:ci`: 268 ms build, preview on port 4179, 18 tests in ~10.8 s, screenshots under outputs/screenshots/, exit code 0  
  – `npm ci`: clean install in ~2 s, audits 86 packages, 16 funding-eligible, 0 vulnerabilities  

• Dev Server Verification  
  – `npm run dev` starts Vite server at http://localhost:4173 with no errors (pid: 16705)  

• Latest E2E Run  
  – Ran `npm run test:e2e`: 18 tests passed across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit in ~10.7 s with no failures.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
In your terminal (with your working directory set to the project root), run this single command to stop the running dev server process:

kill 16705
---

**This was the result:**
---
Stopped process 16705 (npm run dev) with SIGKILL
