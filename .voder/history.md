Here’s a concise history of what’s been done so far:

• Project Setup & UI  
  – Initialized a static, ESM-only SvelteKit app (SSR disabled) and migrated to TypeScript  
  – Replaced Reveal.js slides with GSAP/ScrollTrigger animations  
  – Added responsive dark-mode support  

• Testing & CI  
  – Introduced cross-browser Playwright end-to-end tests (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) in GitHub Actions  
  – Split CI into Build, Preview, and Test jobs, achieving 18 reliable E2E test passes  

• Dependency Audit & Upgrades  
  – Reviewed ~134 packages, patched 17 vulnerabilities  
  – Upgraded Vite, Svelte, SvelteKit; reprovisioned @threlte/core; pinned key dependencies  
  – Fixed dev-server errors and restored nine broken E2E tests  

• Performance & Demos  
  – Optimized CSS delivery and loaded GSAP asynchronously  
  – Built Threlte demos: scroll-triggered hexagon fades and a full-viewport Three.js/Threlte BrandEntry scene  

• Configuration, Documentation & Cleanup  
  – Regenerated and tightened svelte.config.js, tsconfig.json, vite.config.js  
  – Streamlined import paths; added an SVG flow diagram to README  
  – Created HeroSection and StarfieldBackground components with ARIA roles; removed legacy code and logs  

• CI Artifacts & Verification  
  – Produced SSR and client bundles (~444 modules) and served the static site on port 4173  
  – Configured Playwright to capture full-page screenshots; documented artifact locations  
  – Updated README “Available Scripts” (including `npm run test:e2e`) and verified via grep  

• Most Recent Action & Outcome  
  – Ran `npm run test:ci` (build → preview → test:e2e)  
  – Build step: synced, built SSR and client bundles (416 modules), generated gzip size report  
  – Preview step: served on localhost:4173  
  – E2E step: ran 18 Playwright tests across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit—all 18 passed in ~10.5 s
