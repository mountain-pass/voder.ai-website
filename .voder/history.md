Chronological summary of work completed to date:

- Repository & tooling
  - Established a monorepo with locked dependencies, Husky git hooks and Vite theming.
  - Integrated Playwright-Axe for accessibility checks and Lighthouse CI for performance audits.

- Performance & accessibility
  - Inlined critical CSS, pruned unused styles, fixed TypeScript errors.
  - Added prefers-reduced-motion support and eliminated most Axe violations.

- 3D, animations & runtime
  - Lazy-loaded Three.js, GSAP and ScrollTrigger with reduced‑motion honoring.
  - Patched GSAP runtime typings and syntax issues; stubbed THREE/GSAP globals and statically rendered key sections.

- Testing & CI/CD
  - Authored 42 cross-browser E2E tests plus 15 Chrome-only specs.
  - Configured GitHub Actions for unit tests, visual-regression comparisons, Lighthouse audits and preview deploys.
  - Created visual-screenshots.spec.ts to capture section/transition states across viewports and browsers.

- Build & bundle optimizations
  - Removed excess CSS, split vendor chunks, enabled gzip and Draco compression.
  - Reduced build times and Time-to-Interactive; shipped ~250 gzipped modules; documented full tsc + Vite build metrics.

- Metrics, docs & security
  - Added Lighthouse assertions, bundle-size logging, social/meta tags, ADRs and custom Vite lint rules.
  - Upgraded packages and remediated multiple vulnerabilities discovered during audits.

- Styling & ARIA fixes
  - Unified color variables, scoped component styles, externalized Sentry config.
  - Patched five components for ARIA compliance, fixed live regions and search accessibility.
  - Applied multiple CSS patches (including high-contrast rules) and removed duplicated rules in src/style.css.

- Plugin & config cleanup
  - Removed obsolete devDependencies, refactored vite.config.ts and fine‑tuned esbuild options.

- Scroll-based transitions & accessibility
  - Built an accessible multi‑phase scroll flow (BrandEntry → TheWhy → OutcomeFocus → ClosingMoment) with ARIA announcements, skip-links, test hooks and full Playwright coverage.
  - Patched TransitionController.init() to register a global Escape-key listener for skip().

- Final build/runtime tweaks
  - Removed liveRegionSelector, removed duplicate TransitionController init, silenced TS6133 warnings, freed a conflicting port and patched miscellaneous flow configs.

- Verification & test runs
  - Multiple Playwright CI runs with varying results: initial run 45 passing; later runs 51/54 passing (three color-contrast failures); targeted runs passing 81 tests across Chrome, Firefox and Safari for 3D and Vision Flow features; subsequent re-runs reverted to 51/54 passing. Specific color-contrast issues were tracked and one involved a <pre> element later wrapped in an aria-live container.

- BrandEntry3D enhancements
  - Implemented eight major improvements: ignition pulse scaling, volumetric beam-of-light reveal, atmospheric particle optimizations with quality‑based update frequencies, multi‑layer breathing rotations, advanced lighting with quality‑based shadow mapping, choreographed 6s sequence timing, atmospheric complexity layers, and device‑specific quality presets.
  - Added detectQualityPreset() to detect GPU/device capability.

- Quality-based performance
  - Implemented presets affecting particle counts (~440/220/110+), update frequencies, shadow-map sizes, and graceful degradation for low-capability devices.
  - Logged detected presets to the console.

- Vision Flow & animated schematic
  - Implemented HowItWorksSection and VisionFlowAnimatedSchematic with a 3.5s choreographed animation (6 phases), interactive SVG nodes, sequential stroke animations, path morphing (GPS → schematic), tooltips, keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, live regions and reduced-motion fallbacks.
  - Vision Flow tests passed across Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

- Animation & visual test infra
  - Enhanced animation-utils.ts and GSAP typings; added data-animating/data-initial-animation-complete checks and fallback logic.

- Development guidelines & prompt-engineering infra
  - Updated prompts/guidelines.md with visual assessment requirements; added .github prompts for progress and history.
  - Excluded screenshots/ from VCS; created implementation-progress.md documenting ~65–70% compliance with section-by-section evidence.

- Live Prompt Interaction system
  - Built LivePromptInteraction.ts (545 lines) and live-prompt-interaction.css (403 lines) to replace static mockups with a dynamic demo (automatic cycling, hover reveals, GSAP morphing, split-screen layout).
  - Integrated into PromptIterationSection with test-environment detection and accessibility features (ARIA live regions, skip links, keyboard navigation).

- Live prompt testing & accessibility fixes
  - Updated prompt-iteration.spec.ts, removed role="img" from interactive elements, adjusted selectors and cleaned backup tests.
  - Achieved 100% test pass rate (35/35) across browsers for the Live Prompt Interaction System; Axe scans passed for that system.

- Recent patches and current state
  - Wrapped a problematic <pre class="prompt-content"> in an aria-live="polite" container, removed duplicate CSS blocks, and applied a latest CSS high-contrast patch.
  - CI runs continued to show the Playwright pass counts noted above; a single earlier Axe color-contrast violation on that <pre> element was addressed by the live-region wrap.

- Most recent package/install activity
  - Executed npm ci in the project root; install completed, adding 662 packages and auditing 686 packages in ~8s.
  - The run reported 0 vulnerabilities and 243 packages looking for funding. package-lock.json and node_modules/ were produced.

- Most recent repository inspections
  - Read/checked package.json, .gitignore, postcss.config.ts, htmlhint.config.js(.cjs), README.md, various lint/config files and CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml).
  - Verified existence of scripts/prepare-libraries.js and searched docs/**. File-read and existence checks completed successfully.

- Most recent file/tool actions (work performed through tooling)
  - Ran a sequence of repository commands/tools: find_files, search_file_content, read_file, check_file_exists, generate_file and modify_file.
  - Generated scripts/prepare-libraries.js (script to collect README files from node_modules into docs/libraries), added a "prepare": "node scripts/prepare-libraries.js" script to package.json, and updated package.json (full file overwritten with current content).
  - Verified node_modules existence and re-read package.json; the toolchain reported "Action completed successfully."
