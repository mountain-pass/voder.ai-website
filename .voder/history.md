Here’s a concise history of what’s been done so far:

• Project Bootstrap  
 – Scaffolded an ESM-only SvelteKit + TypeScript app (SSR disabled)  
 – Replaced Reveal.js with a custom dark-mode GSAP/ScrollTrigger presentation

• Testing & CI  
 – Added 21 Playwright end-to-end tests covering flows, layouts, errors, responsiveness  
 – Configured GitHub Actions to build, run tests, and deploy preview environments on pushes/PRs

• Dependency Audit & Upgrades  
 – Audited 134 npm packages and resolved 17 security issues  
 – Upgraded Vite, Svelte, and SvelteKit with all breaking-change fixes applied

• Performance Optimizations & Demos  
 – Deferred GSAP loading and optimized CSS delivery  
 – Built two Threlte demos: a scroll-triggered hexagon fade and a full-viewport Three.js scene

• Configuration & Component Development  
 – Refined svelte.config.js, tsconfig.json, and vite.config.js; removed legacy code  
 – Created HeroSection and StarfieldBackground components; added an SVG flowchart to the README

• Bundling & Testing Rounds  
 – Produced SSR and client bundles (~444 modules) with build-time screenshots  
 – Executed 18 unit tests and 24 end-to-end tests; achieved two clean production builds

• Accessibility & Cross-Browser Compliance  
 – Integrated @axe-core/playwright and fixed six accessibility issues  
 – Confirmed zero critical violations on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit

• Documentation & Assets  
 – Enhanced README with new npm scripts; added preview.png, favicon.ico, and brand-entry.png  
 – Tuned Vite manualChunks for Three.js/Threlte, GSAP/ScrollTrigger, and core components

• Architecture & Linting  
 – Documented ADR #0006 (manual chunk splitting) and ADR #0007 (ESLint/Prettier adoption)  
 – Installed and configured ESLint for Svelte/TypeScript; added lint scripts and a CI lint step

• ESLint Config Evolution  
 – Added .eslintrc.cjs and new components (OutcomeSection.svelte, voder-logo.svg); patched ClosingMomentSection  
 – Migrated to an ESM flat-config (eslint.config.js), removed the old .eslintrc.cjs, and installed eslint-define-config  
 – Updated .github/workflows/ci.yml to include a “Run ESLint” step after npm ci

• Latest Lint Run  
 – Ran `npm run lint` and got the following output

```text

> voder.ai-website@1.0.0 lint
> eslint "src/**/*.{js,ts,svelte}"

```
