Summary of work completed to date

Repository & tooling
- Created a locked monorepo (committed package-lock.json and node_modules), added Husky hooks, Vite theming and custom Vite lint rules.
- Added Playwright‑Axe, Lighthouse CI, many repo scripts (including scripts/prepare-libraries.js), health/audit/verify scripts and .github/scripts/parse-audit.js.
- Reviewed and updated core repo files (.gitignore, package.json, postcss.config.ts, htmlhint.config, README, CI/lint configs).
- Added a security-audit GitHub Actions workflow, install/verification README content and ADRs.

Performance & accessibility
- Inlined critical CSS, removed unused/duplicate styles, unified color variables and applied high‑contrast CSS patches.
- Fixed TypeScript errors, honored prefers-reduced-motion, resolved most Axe violations and patched five components for ARIA compliance.
- Wrapped a problematic <pre class="prompt-content"> in an aria-live="polite" container and tracked/addressed color‑contrast issues.

3D, animations & runtime
- Lazy‑loaded Three.js, GSAP and ScrollTrigger with reduced‑motion fallbacks; patched GSAP typings and stubbed globals.
- Implemented BrandEntry3D with pulse/beam/particles, multi-layer rotations, advanced lighting/shadow mapping, atmospheric layers and device quality presets.
- Added detectQualityPreset() to degrade visuals by device.

Vision Flow & animated schematic
- Implemented HowItWorksSection and VisionFlowAnimatedSchematic: a 3.5s choreographed animation across six phases with interactive SVG nodes, stroke animations, path morphing and tooltips.
- Added keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, live regions and reduced‑motion fallbacks.
- Executed Vision Flow tests across Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

Scroll‑based transitions & accessibility
- Built an accessible multi‑phase scroll flow (BrandEntry → TheWhy → OutcomeFocus → ClosingMoment) with ARIA announcements, skip‑links and test hooks.
- Patched TransitionController.init() to register a global Escape listener for skip() and added Playwright coverage.

Live Prompt Interaction system
- Replaced static mockups with a dynamic LivePromptInteraction demo (automatic cycling, hover reveals, GSAP morphing, split‑screen layout).
- Integrated it into PromptIterationSection with test‑env detection and accessibility features; updated tests/selectors.
- Achieved 35/35 passing across browsers for this system and passed Axe scans.

Testing & CI/CD
- Wrote 42 cross‑browser E2E tests and 15 Chrome‑only specs; added visual‑screenshots.spec.ts for visual states across viewports/browsers.
- Configured GitHub Actions for unit tests, visual regression, Lighthouse audits and preview deploys; added Lighthouse assertions and bundle‑size logging.
- Improved animation determinism for tests (animation‑utils.ts, GSAP typings, data-animating/data-initial-animation-complete checks).

Verification & test runs
- Ran multiple Playwright CI runs: initial 45 passing, later 51/54 (three color‑contrast failures).
- Executed targeted runs that passed 81 tests across Chrome/Firefox/Safari for 3D and Vision Flow.
- Final reported test/action sequences completed successfully.

Build & bundle optimizations
- Removed excess CSS, split vendor chunks, enabled gzip and Draco compression.
- Reduced build times and improved Time To Interactive (TTI); shipped ~250 gzipped modules.
- Documented tsc + Vite metrics, refactored vite.config.ts, tuned esbuild and removed obsolete devDependencies.

Metrics, docs & security
- Added social/meta tags, ADRs and SECURITY.md referencing audits and remediation artifacts.
- Upgraded packages, remediated multiple vulnerabilities and produced audit artifacts (audit.json, audit-fix.log, audit-postfix.json, audit-summary.md).
- Performed a repository secrets scan, produced redacted artifacts and staged SECURITY.md and scan/audit artifacts in git.

Styling, ARIA & miscellaneous fixes
- Scoped component styles, externalized Sentry config, removed duplicate CSS, silenced TypeScript warnings and patched miscellaneous flow configs.

Package/install & repo maintenance
- Ran npm ci in project root (~662 packages added, 686 audited), produced package-lock.json and reported 0 vulnerabilities (with ~243 packages seeking funding).
- Verified/created scripts/prepare-libraries.js, ran health checks, linting, type checks and repository reads.
- Modified src/main.ts to import './app.js' (NodeNext), replaced console.log with console.warn and removed unused imports in scripts/health-check.js.
- Ran npx tsc --noEmit and inspected node/npm versions and git status.

Audit & secrets work
- Executed npm audit and npm audit fix --package-lock-only; created audit‑fix artifacts and audit-summary.md.
- Performed a repository secrets scan and produced redacted outputs; committed SECURITY.md and related artifacts.

Recent test/dev file activity
- Created and iterated tests/coverage-increase.test.ts to raise coverage for src/app.ts and src/main.ts (used vi.doMock and simulated DOMContentLoaded).
- Executed vitest and npm test:coverage runs; modified/regenerated coverage tests and updated vitest.config.ts coverage/exclude settings.
- Refactored scripts/prepare-libraries.js to an ESM async prepareLibraries(root) export returning a summary object while preserving CLI exit behavior.

Most recent file/tool operations & runs
- Read, modified or generated: src/app.ts, src/main.ts, vitest.config.ts, config/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts, package.json, tests/main.test.ts, tests/coverage-increase.test.ts, scripts/prepare-libraries.js, scripts/health-check.{js,ts}, tests/health-check-utils.test.ts, tests/prepare-libraries.test.ts, README.md.
- Created docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md and committed it ("docs: add Developer Setup & Verification guide").
- Ran a series of tooling commands (lint, audit:fix, build, test:ci, reads of audit artifacts); the final reported result of the last action sequence was: Action completed successfully.

Most recently executed action (explicit)
- Performed multiple read_file and run_command operations (including npm run format:check, npm --version, node --version, ls of node_modules, npm run lint:check, reading tsconfig.json and config/testing files, and find_files on config/testing/*).
- The explicit sequence of tool uses ended with: Action completed successfully.
