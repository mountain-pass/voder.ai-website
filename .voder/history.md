Here’s a concise history of completed work to date, organized by area.

Repository & tooling
- Created a locked monorepo with Husky hooks, Vite theming and locked dependencies; committed package-lock.json and node_modules after npm ci.
- Added Playwright‑Axe, Lighthouse CI, numerous repo scripts (including scripts/prepare-libraries.js), health/audit/verify scripts, and .github/scripts/parse-audit.js.
- Reviewed/updated core repo files (.gitignore, package.json, postcss.config.ts, htmlhint.config, README, CI/lint configs) and added a security-audit GitHub Actions workflow.
- Committed README.md with install/verification instructions and ADRs; added custom Vite lint rules.

Performance & accessibility
- Inlined critical CSS, removed unused/duplicate styles, unified color variables and applied high‑contrast CSS patches.
- Fixed TypeScript errors, respected prefers-reduced-motion, resolved most Axe violations and patched five components for ARIA compliance.
- Wrapped a problematic <pre class="prompt-content"> in an aria-live="polite" container; tracked and addressed color-contrast issues.

3D, animations & runtime
- Lazy‑loaded Three.js, GSAP and ScrollTrigger with reduced‑motion fallbacks; patched GSAP typings and stubbed globals.
- Implemented BrandEntry3D with pulse/beam/particles, multi-layer rotations, advanced lighting/shadow mapping, atmospheric layers and device quality presets.
- Added detectQualityPreset() to degrade visuals by device.

Vision Flow & animated schematic
- Implemented HowItWorksSection and VisionFlowAnimatedSchematic: 3.5s choreographed animation across six phases with interactive SVG nodes, stroke animations, path morphing and tooltips.
- Added keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, live regions and reduced‑motion fallbacks; Vision Flow tests executed across Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

Scroll‑based transitions & accessibility
- Built an accessible multi‑phase scroll flow (BrandEntry → TheWhy → OutcomeFocus → ClosingMoment) with ARIA announcements, skip‑links and test hooks.
- Patched TransitionController.init() to register a global Escape listener for skip() and added Playwright coverage.

Live Prompt Interaction system
- Replaced static mockups with a dynamic LivePromptInteraction demo (automatic cycling, hover reveals, GSAP morphing, split‑screen layout).
- Integrated into PromptIterationSection with test‑env detection and accessibility features; updated tests/selectors.
- System achieved 35/35 passing across browsers and passed Axe scans.

Testing & CI/CD
- Wrote 42 cross‑browser E2E tests and 15 Chrome‑only specs; added visual‑screenshots.spec.ts for visual states across viewports/browsers.
- Configured GitHub Actions for unit tests, visual regression, Lighthouse audits and preview deploys; added Lighthouse assertions and bundle‑size logging in CI.
- Enhanced animation determinism for tests (animation‑utils.ts, GSAP typings, data-animating/data-initial-animation-complete checks).

Verification & test runs
- Ran multiple Playwright CI runs: initial 45 passing; later 51/54 (three color‑contrast failures).
- Ran targeted runs that passed 81 tests across Chrome/Firefox/Safari for 3D and Vision Flow.
- Final reported test/action sequences completed successfully.

Build & bundle optimizations
- Removed excess CSS, split vendor chunks, enabled gzip and Draco compression.
- Reduced build times and improved Time To Interactive (TTI); shipped ~250 gzipped modules.
- Documented tsc + Vite metrics, refactored vite.config.ts, tuned esbuild and removed obsolete devDependencies.

Metrics, docs & security
- Added social/meta tags, ADRs, SECURITY.md referencing audits, and .github prompts for progress/history.
- Upgraded packages, remediated multiple vulnerabilities and produced audit artifacts (audit.json, audit-fix.log, audit-postfix.json, audit-summary.md).
- Performed a repository secrets scan and produced redacted artifacts; staged SECURITY.md and scan/audit artifacts in git.

Styling, ARIA & miscellaneous fixes
- Scoped component styles, externalized Sentry config, removed duplicate CSS, silenced TypeScript warnings and patched miscellaneous flow configs.

Package/install & repo maintenance
- Ran npm ci in project root (~662 packages added, 686 audited), produced package-lock.json, reported 0 vulnerabilities and ~243 packages seeking funding.
- Verified/created scripts/prepare-libraries.js, ran health checks, linting, type checks and repository reads.
- Modified src/main.ts to import './app.js' (NodeNext), replaced console.log with console.warn and removed unused imports in scripts/health-check.js.
- Ran npx tsc --noEmit and inspected node/npm versions and git status.

Audit & secrets work
- Executed npm audit, ran npm audit fix --package-lock-only, created audit-fix artifacts and audit-summary.md.
- Performed repository secrets scan, produced redacted outputs and committed SECURITY.md and related artifacts.

Recent test/dev file activity and runs
- Created and iterated tests/coverage-increase.test.ts to increase coverage for src/app.ts and src/main.ts (used vi.doMock and simulated DOMContentLoaded).
- Executed vitest and npm test:coverage runs; modified/regenerated coverage tests during workflow.
- Frequently used commands/tools: git status, read_file on key files, generate/modify/remove file for tests, npx vitest, npm run test:coverage, npm run security:local, npm install --package-lock-only, npm ci --no-audit --no-fund, and various git operations.
- Final reported result of the last action sequence: Action completed successfully.

Most recent file/tool activity
- Read/modified/generated files: src/app.ts, src/main.ts, vitest.config.ts, config/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts, package.json, tests/main.test.ts, tests/coverage-increase.test.ts, scripts/prepare-libraries.js, scripts/health-check.js, scripts/health-check-utils.{ts,js}, tests/health-check-utils.test.ts, tests/prepare-libraries.test.ts, README.md.
- Modified vitest.config.ts to focus coverage on src/**/*.ts and updated coverage.exclude.
- Created helper modules and tests for health checks, prepare-libraries behavior and package-lock/node_modules/semver checks.

Most recently executed actions
- Read the prepare-libraries and health-check helper files and tests, ran npm test, and reported: Action completed successfully.
