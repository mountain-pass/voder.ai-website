  – Added Playwright + Axe tests (zero A/AA violations)  

• Section skeleton & animations

  – Integrated Three.js, GSAP + ScrollTrigger, GLTFLoader, with reduced-motion support  
  – Implemented ARIA-live typing effects and initial copy  

• Content completion & production build  
  – Finalized all sections, ensured focusability, resolved TypeScript errors  
  – Produced an optimized 22-module production build  

• E2E & accessibility enhancements  
  – Added WCAG 2A/2AA tests via @axe-core/playwright (8 tests; no violations)  
  – Added alt text, test IDs, ARIA labels across the app  

• Styling, linting & cleanup  
  – Updated CSS (brand fonts, variables, skip-link), installed JetBrains Mono, patched headlines  
  – Ran ESLint (1 warning) and Prettier; removed unused code  

• Documentation & placeholders  
  – Created README symlinks in `docs/libraries` (Three.js, GSAP, Inter, Sentry, Vite)  
  – Moved scroll-animation stubs into `docs/placeholders.md`  

• Additional tests & dev-env tweaks  
  – Added Playwright E2E test for reduced-motion fallback  
  – Freed up ports 5173 & 4173  

• Cross-browser test suite  
  – Ran 9 E2E tests on Chromium (7.4 s, 100% pass) and 27 on Firefox/WebKit (100% pass)  

• Builds, formatting & meta  
  – Multiple `npm run build`/`preview` runs (22 modules, ~1.2 s build)  
  – Ran `npm run format`/`lint:fix` (0 errors, 1 warning)  
  – Added meta tags (description, Open Graph, Twitter Card) and favicon  

• Most recent patches  
  – Updated `src/lib/animations.ts` (GLB loading, renderer size, z-index, camera position)  
  – Refined GSAP scroll-triggered animations (hero, diagrams, outcomes; added curtain and logo pulse)  
  – Appended curtain overlay, keyframes, benefit-grid CSS to `src/style.css`  

• Latest file edit  
  – Patched `src/components/OutcomeSection.ts`: removed inline styles and added `benefit-item` and `benefit-icon` utility classes

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

From the project root, run this single command:

  cp assets/mockups/cube.glb public/assets/cube.glb
---

**This was the result:**
---
`bash -c cp assets/mockups/cube.glb public/assets/cube.glb` completed.
