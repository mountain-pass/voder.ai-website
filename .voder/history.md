- **Technical Debt Management**: Clear documentation enables prioritized resolution in future development cycles

**Process Validation Achievement:**
This comprehensive problem management cycle demonstrated the effectiveness of the assess→plan→act methodology, establishing reliable foundation for continued development while maintaining production-quality standards through systematic quality gate enforcement.

## October 1, 2025 - E2E Test Resolution Verification (Assessment Confirmation)

**Implementation Plan Execution**:
Followed structured act.prompt.md workflow to implement planned Mobile Chrome E2E test timeout resolution based on previously created implementation plan.
