Here’s a consolidated history of everything completed in the project so far:

• Project Setup  
  – Initialized a Git repo with locked dependencies, Husky hooks and Vite theming  
  – Integrated Playwright-Axe and Lighthouse CI from day one  

• Performance & Accessibility  
  – Inlined critical CSS, purged unused styles and fixed TypeScript errors  
  – Added prefers-reduced-motion support and cleared all Axe violations  

• 3D Graphics & Animations  
  – Lazy-loaded Three.js, GSAP and ScrollTrigger; deferred non-critical animations  
  – Slimmed the GSAP bundle and honored reduced-motion preferences  

• Testing & CI/CD  
  – Wrote 42 Playwright E2E specs across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit  
  – Configured GitHub Actions for unit tests, visual regression, Lighthouse audits and preview deploys  

• Build & Bundle Optimizations  
  – Removed leftover CSS, split vendor chunks, enabled Draco compression and gzip  
  – Reduced build time to ~1.1–1.4 s and Time to Interactive to ~0.77 s  

• Metrics & Documentation  
  – Added Lighthouse CI assertions and bundle-size logging  
  – Updated social/meta tags, favicons and pruned unused assets  

• Security Hardening  
  – Audited 734 npm packages and remediated 17 vulnerabilities  
  – Introduced an ADR and enforced the Vite “Beasties” plugin  

• Refactoring & CI Stability  
  – Fixed Vite syntax issues, unified color variables, scoped styles  
  – Externalized Sentry config, raised CI timeouts and enabled GSAP tracing  

• Component & ARIA Compliance  
  – Streamlined content sections; patched five components for ARIA compliance  
  – Resolved E2E search-pattern mismatches  

• Plugin & Config Refinements  
  – Simplified Beasties settings and removed obsolete devDependencies  
  – Refactored vite.config.ts with defineConfig and tuned esbuild options  

• Animations Module Evolution  
  – Consolidated dynamic imports with try/catch and exposed THREE & GSAP globally  

• Test Patches & Timeout Tuning  
  – Patched dynamic-import and reduced-motion specs; added waitForLoadState calls  
  – Simplified test logic by waiting for network-idle and asserting global availability  

• Final Spec Updates & Cross-Browser Validation  
  – Added explicit boolean checks and load-state waits  
  – Ran the full 42-test suite on all three browsers—100% pass  

• Lighthouse CI Performance Budget Check  
  – Defined budgets in .lighthouseci/ and vite.config.ts; updated lighthouserc.json  
  – Executed “npm run assert:lhci” against dist/ and initially passed all checks  

• Inline-CSS Production Build Patch  
  – Updated vite.config.ts to use vite-plugin-inline-source, inlining all CSS into HTML  

• Most Recent Action  
  – Modified inlineSource plugin options (inlineThreshold: Infinity, allowRules: ['.*/']) to force-inline every stylesheet  
  – Patch applied successfully, embedding all CSS into the build output  

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Modify the file at `./vite.config.ts` to disable the CSS-inlining plugin so that all CSS is emitted as external files instead of being embedded into your HTML. This change will shrink your HTML payload and speed up its parsing.
