So far in the project, the team has:

- Initialized the project as an ESM npm package scaffolded with Vite, including a neon-terminal demo with bundle-size and timing benchmarks.
- Developed Playwright smoke tests for mobile and tablet, along with thorough end-to-end test suites running on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit; configured GitHub Actions and documented decisions across ADR-0001 to ADR-0004.
- Cleaned legacy files, updated `.gitignore` and markup, and expanded the README with styling guidelines, breakpoints, global styles, CSS snippets, navigation notes, and instructions for end-to-end testing.
- Integrated reveal.js by installing it, creating sample slides, applying bundling patches, and broadened end-to-end test coverage from 15 to 18 tests, covering numerous UI components and visual regressions.
- Measured key performance metrics such as production build times, E2E runtimes, CI package install times, and gzipped bundle sizes.
- Implemented several improvements including removing external CDN dependencies, adding console-error smoke tests, fixing bugs, enabling screenshots and traces on test failures, resolving stray server and git-add issues, standardizing folder structure, and adding keyboard-navigation and deep-linking tests with screenshots.
- Verified CI and development workflows to ensure dependency installs occur without vulnerabilities, production builds and previews function properly, and tests run successfully on all target browsers; confirmed local Vite development runs without errors.
- Updated dependencies and project configurations by setting `"type": "module"` in `package.json`, adding SvelteKit dev dependencies, creating and refining SvelteKit config files (`svelte.config.js`, `.cjs`), updating `vite.config.js` to include the SvelteKit plugin, generating `src/app.html`, removing legacy files, renaming CSS files, and adding route components.
- Committed significant configuration and routing updates, including a notable commit titled “chore: add SvelteKit config…”.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Modify the file `package.json` in the project root to update its content according to the latest working state. This includes:

- Removing any references to the old `src/index.html` and `src/main.css` if present.
- Ensuring the scripts section correctly references SvelteKit commands such as `"dev": "svelte-kit dev"`, `"build": "svelte-kit build"`, `"preview": "svelte-kit preview"`, and the `"test:ci"` command for running Playwright tests.
- Making sure dependencies and devDependencies are properly listed as per the project's current requirements.
- Verifying that there are no obsolete or conflicting settings related to the removed legacy files or old configurations.

Once you have updated the `package.json` file with the above changes, save it. After that, run the following command to install and update dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will ensure that the project dependencies are synchronized with the updated `package.json` configuration.
