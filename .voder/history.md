Here’s a concise recap of what’s been done so far:

• Project initialization  
  – Set up a Vite-based ESM npm package with build/dev/preview/test scripts, neon-terminal demo, and bundle-size/timing benchmarks.  

• Testing & CI  
  – Added Playwright smoke tests and a GitHub Actions workflow (build → preview → E2E). Documented ADR-0001 through ADR-0003.  

• Code & documentation overhaul  
  – Removed legacy files. Revamped README with styling guidelines, auto-injected breakpoints, global-style snippets, and refined CSS accents/media queries.  

• Responsive-design verification  
  – Added Playwright tests for container padding and typography at 640×800 and 1024×768 viewports, capturing screenshots in CI.  

• Reveal.js integration  
  – Installed Reveal.js, updated initialization, and created four sample slides.  

• Expanded E2E coverage  
  – Cleaned unused markup/scripts, replaced a flaky SVG assertion, and added checks for hero <h1>, meta tags, text blocks, SVG count, effects, OG image, title/metadata, and footer. Stabilized nine smoke tests with retry logic.  

• Cross-browser navigation suite  
  – Verified keyboard navigation, deep-link hashes, and URL assertions across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (15 tests, ~10–12s).  

• Documentation & ADR update  
  – Expanded README’s E2E section with navigation details and recorded ADR-0004.  

• Log cleanup & .gitignore tweaks  
  – Purged old logs/output files, created outputs/ folder, set Playwright’s outputDir, and updated .gitignore.  

• Production build & CI run  
  – Executed npm run build (295ms → dist/ with HTML/JS/CSS/fonts/assets) and npm run test:ci (build → preview → Playwright). All 15 tests passed in ~12s; artifacts saved.  

• Final housekeeping  
  – Deleted obsolete test-results/ directory; added `.env`, `dist/`, `node_modules/`, `outputs/`, and `.voder-processes.json` to .gitignore.  

• Installation & audit  
  – Ran npm ci (85 packages in 2s, 0 vulnerabilities).  

• Most recent test run  
  – Ran npm run test:e2e: 15 Playwright tests across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit—all passed in ~10.4s.  

• Latest action & outcome  
  – Attempted to stage updated/new files with  
     `git add .gitignore README.md playwright.config.js docs/prompt-guidelines.md .voder/`  
  – Received error:  
     fatal: pathspec 'docs/prompt-guidelines.md' did not match any files.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Open the file at `.voder/plan.md`.  
Find every instance of

```
docs/prompt-guidelines.md
```

and replace it with

```
prompts/development-guidelines.md
```

Save the changes to `.voder/plan.md`.
