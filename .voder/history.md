Here’s a concise history of what’s been done so far:

• Bootstrapped a SvelteKit ESM app (static build, SSR off) and resolved initial build errors  
• Migrated Playwright tests to ESM and configured GitHub Actions for preview deployments and E2E runs on Chromium/Firefox/WebKit  
• Replaced Reveal.js with GSAP/ScrollTrigger (via an animateSlide helper), added responsive dark-mode and dynamic plugin loading, and removed legacy selectors/tests  
• Adopted TypeScript, audited ~128 dependencies (patched 11 security issues), upgraded Vite/Svelte/SvelteKit/adapter-static, applied ~1,000 updates, and dropped `@threlte/core`  
• Eliminated all dev-server errors and prod-build warnings; fixed nine failing E2E tests so CI now passes on all browsers  
• Refined CSS/preprocessor setup; optimized async GSAP imports; experimented with Three.js and added a Threlte `<Canvas>` hexagon demo  
• Extracted “The Problem” and “GPS vs Directions” into standalone Svelte components and integrated them into the main page  
• Scoped scroll initialization to `[data-scroll-section]` and created four fade-in scroll sections (`HowItWorks`, `PromptIteration`, `Outcome`, `ClosingMoment`)  
• Refactored the BrandEntry route: full-viewport `<section>`, disabled SSR, dynamic `useFrame` import in `onMount`, and route-specific CSS; updated Playwright’s server command  
• Swapped the old BrandEntry scene for a Threlte-based rotating hexagon with ambient and directional lights  
• Promoted ADR-0005 (adopt Threlte/Three) from “proposed” to “accepted” and removed the obsolete `e2e-test-results.log`  
• Ran `npm run sync` & `npm run build` to regenerate bundles and produce a static `build/` output  
• Executed `npm run test:ci`: built the project, launched a preview server, and ran 15 Playwright tests across three browsers—100% passed  
• Moved `export const ssr = false` into `+page.server.ts` and removed the module script block from `+page.svelte`  
• Completed final builds without errors or warnings; produced output under `.svelte-kit/output` and `build/`  
• Updated `README.md` with BrandEntry demo instructions; repeated CI runs—all passed on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit  
• Enhanced `src/app.css` with a navy–black gradient, starfield background, and Earth-horizon graphic; verified successful builds and E2E passes  
• Added `src/lib/assets/flow.svg` and updated `HowItWorksSection.svelte` to render it; verified on dev server  
• Modified `tests/smoke.spec.js` to replace the old SVG-text locator with a new image-alt check  
• Ran `npm run test:ci` in the project root (timed out after 60s)  
• Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` by splitting the CI pipeline into separate “Build,” “Start Preview Server,” and “Run E2E tests” steps  
• Finally committed and pushed the updated CI workflow file to `main`, creating several new files and adjusting 14 files with 218 insertions and 232 deletions.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Run the following from the project root to push your local `main` (with the updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) up to GitHub:

Command:
```
git push origin main
```
---

**This was the result:**
---
`git push origin main` completed.
Output:
