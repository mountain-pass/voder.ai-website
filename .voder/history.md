Summary of work completed so far

- Repository & tooling
  - Created a monorepo with locked dependencies, Husky hooks and Vite theming.
  - Added Playwright‑Axe and Lighthouse CI, repository scripts (including scripts/prepare‑libraries.js) and health/audit/verify scripts.
  - Reviewed and updated core repo files (.gitignore, package.json, postcss.config.ts, htmlhint.config, README, CI/lint configs).
  - Ran repository tooling, generated src/app.ts and src/main.ts (init on DOMContentLoaded), and added Vitest DOM tests.
  - Added and updated numerous scripts, ran health checks (node scripts/health-check.js, npm run type-check) and lint/type-check commands.

- Performance & accessibility
  - Inlined critical CSS, pruned unused styles, removed duplicate CSS and unified color variables.
  - Fixed TypeScript errors, honored prefers‑reduced‑motion, resolved most Axe violations, applied high‑contrast CSS patches.
  - Wrapped a problematic <pre class="prompt-content"> in an aria‑live="polite" container and patched five components for ARIA compliance.

- 3D, animations & runtime
  - Lazy‑loaded Three.js, GSAP and ScrollTrigger with reduced‑motion fallbacks.
  - Patched GSAP typings/syntax, stubbed global THREE/GSAP where needed, and statically rendered key sections.
  - Implemented BrandEntry3D with pulse/beam/particles/multi‑layer rotations, advanced lighting/shadow mapping, atmospheric layers and device quality presets.
  - Added detectQualityPreset() for quality‑based degradation.

- Vision Flow & animated schematic
  - Implemented HowItWorksSection and VisionFlowAnimatedSchematic: a 3.5s choreographed animation across six phases with interactive SVG nodes, stroke animations, path morphing and tooltips.
  - Added keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, live regions and reduced‑motion fallbacks.
  - Verified Vision Flow tests across Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

- Scroll‑based transitions & accessibility
  - Built an accessible multi‑phase scroll flow (BrandEntry → TheWhy → OutcomeFocus → ClosingMoment) with ARIA announcements, skip‑links, test hooks and Playwright coverage.
  - Patched TransitionController.init() to register a global Escape listener for skip().

- Live Prompt Interaction system
  - Replaced static mockups with a dynamic demo (LivePromptInteraction.ts and live‑prompt‑interaction.css) featuring automatic cycling, hover reveals, GSAP morphing and split‑screen layout.
  - Integrated into PromptIterationSection with test‑env detection and accessibility features (ARIA live regions, skip links, keyboard navigation).
  - Updated tests/selectors and achieved 100% test pass rate (35/35) across browsers for that system; Axe scans passed for it.

- Testing & CI/CD
  - Wrote 42 cross‑browser E2E tests and 15 Chrome‑only specs; added visual‑screenshots.spec.ts to capture states across viewports/browsers.
  - Configured GitHub Actions for unit tests, visual regression, Lighthouse audits and preview deploys.
  - Added Lighthouse assertions and bundle‑size logging to CI.

- Verification & test runs
  - Ran multiple Playwright CI runs (e.g., initial 45 passing; later 51/54 with three color‑contrast failures).
  - Ran targeted runs that passed 81 tests across Chrome/Firefox/Safari for 3D and Vision Flow.
  - Tracked and addressed specific color‑contrast issues (including the <pre>).

- Build & bundle optimizations
  - Removed excess CSS, split vendor chunks, enabled gzip and Draco compression.
  - Reduced build times and improved TTI; shipped ~250 gzipped modules.
  - Documented tsc + Vite metrics; refactored vite.config.ts, tuned esbuild and removed obsolete devDependencies.

- Animation & visual test infrastructure
  - Enhanced animation‑utils.ts and GSAP typings.
  - Added data‑animating and data‑initial‑animation‑complete checks and fallback logic to improve animation determinism for tests and visual snapshots.

- Metrics, docs & security
  - Added social/meta tags, ADRs and custom Vite lint rules.
  - Upgraded packages and remediated multiple vulnerabilities from audits.
  - Documented implementation progress (~65–70% compliance) and updated prompts/guidelines.md and .github prompts for progress/history.

- Styling, ARIA & miscellaneous fixes
  - Scoped component styles, externalized Sentry config and applied additional high‑contrast CSS patches.
  - Removed duplicate CSS, silenced TypeScript warnings and patched miscellaneous flow configs.

- Package/install activity
  - Ran npm ci in project root (≈662 packages added, 686 audited); produced package-lock.json and node_modules/; reported 0 vulnerabilities at that run and noted 243 packages looking for funding.

- Repository inspections & file/tool actions
  - Verified/created scripts/prepare‑libraries.js, ran health checks, linting, type checks and repository reads.
  - Modified src/main.ts to import './app.js' (NodeNext resolution), replaced a console.log with console.warn and removed unused imports from scripts/health-check.js.
  - Ran npx tsc --noEmit and inspected node/npm versions, git status and node_modules.

- Audit & secrets work (recent)
  - Executed npm audit, saved audit.json, ran npm audit fix --package-lock-only and re-ran audits; produced audit-fix.log, audit-postfix.json and audit-summary.md.
  - Performed a repository secrets scan, produced repo-secrets-scan.txt and a redacted repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt.
  - Generated SECURITY.md referencing the audit and redacted artifacts, and staged SECURITY.md, repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt and audit-summary.md in git.

- Most recent recorded tool/command activity and final actions
  - Added a parser script .github/scripts/parse-audit.js to summarize npm audit JSON output.
  - Added a GitHub Actions workflow .github/workflows/security-audit.yml to run npm audit and upload audit.json.
  - Added a package.json script "security:local" that runs npm audit --json > audit.json && node .github/scripts/parse-audit.js audit.json.
  - Committed the parser and workflow and ran the new security:local script.
  - The most recent executed sequence completed successfully.
