## October 5, 2025 - CSS Quality Fixes

### Assessment Results
- **Phase 1 (Dependencies)**: ✅ PASSED - Fresh package policy applied correctly
- **Phase 2 (Security)**: ✅ PASSED - No moderate+ vulnerabilities found  
- **Phase 3 (Code Quality)**: ❌ BLOCKED - CSS linting errors found

### Changes Made

#### CSS Linting Issues Resolution
Successfully fixed 6 CSS linting errors in `src/style.css`:

1. **Duplicate Properties Removal**:
   - `.main-content`: Removed duplicate `min-height: 100vh`, kept `min-height: 100dvh`
   - `.container`: Removed duplicate `min-height: 100vh`, kept `min-height: 100dvh` 
   - `.hero-section`: Removed duplicate `height: 100vh`, kept `height: 100svh`
   - Section styling: Removed duplicate `min-height: 100vh`, kept `min-height: 100dvh`

2. **Duplicate Selector Consolidation**:
   - Consolidated duplicate `.hero-title` selector (was at lines 175 and 687)
   - Merged styles into single declaration at line 175

3. **Comment Formatting**:
   - Fixed missing empty line before comment using stylelint auto-fix

#### Quality Gates Verification
- ✅ **ESLint**: 0 errors, 0 warnings (max-warnings 0)
- ✅ **Prettier**: All files properly formatted  
- ✅ **TypeScript**: Type checking passed with 0 errors
- ✅ **Stylelint**: 0 CSS linting errors (previously 6)
- ✅ **Tests**: 205 tests passing, 96.87% coverage

## October 6, 2025 - E2E Test Fixes

### Assessment Results
- **Phase 1 (Dependencies)**: ✅ PASSED - Fresh package policy applied (3 packages < 7 days old)
- **Phase 2 (Security)**: ✅ PASSED - Only low severity vulnerabilities
- **Phase 3 (Code Quality)**: ✅ PASSED - All linting, formatting, type checking passed
- **Phase 4 (Documentation)**: ✅ PASSED - Comprehensive documentation present
- **Phase 5 (Testing)**: ❌ BLOCKED - 20 E2E test failures detected

### Root Cause Analysis
All 20 E2E test failures were caused by **incorrect CSS selectors** in test files that didn't match the actual HTML structure:
- Tests referenced `.status-indicator` class (doesn't exist in HTML)
- Actual HTML uses `.coming-soon-indicator` class
- Tests referenced "Keep Shipping Fast" text (doesn't exist)
- Actual hero title is "AI Coding Without the Slop"
- Tests referenced `.status-text` class (doesn't exist)  
- Actual HTML uses `.coming-soon-text` class

### Changes Made

#### Test Selector Corrections

1. **`tests/e2e/p003-button-overlap.test.ts`** (Fixed 8 failures):
   - Updated all `.status-indicator` references to `.coming-soon-indicator`
   - Renamed `statusIndicator` variables to `comingSoonIndicator` for clarity
   - Fixed z-index stacking test to verify `.hero-section` vs `.hero-animation` (not button vs animation)
   - Reason: `.coming-soon-indicator` is in `.below-fold-content`, not `.hero-section`

2. **`tests/e2e/text-flash-prevention.test.ts`** (Preventive fix, test is skipped):
   - Updated `.status-indicator` references to `.coming-soon-indicator`
   - Maintained consistency across all test files

3. **`tests/e2e/closing-moment.spec.ts`** (Fixed 4 failures):
   - Updated `.status-text` reference to `.coming-soon-text`
   - Renamed `statusText` variable to `comingSoonText`

4. **`tests/e2e/fouc-prevention.test.ts`** (Fixed 4 failures):
   - Updated hero title text from "Keep Shipping Fast" to "AI Coding Without the Slop"
   - Matches actual h1 content in production HTML

#### Test Results
**Before fixes:**
- 20 FAILED ❌
- 22 SKIPPED  
- 146 PASSED
- **Failure rate: 10.6%**

**After fixes:**
- 0 FAILED ✅
- 22 SKIPPED
- 166 PASSED
- **Pass rate: 100%** (of non-skipped tests)

#### Quality Gates Verification
- ✅ **ESLint**: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- ✅ **Prettier**: All files properly formatted
- ✅ **TypeScript**: 0 type errors
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: 205/205 passing (100%)
- ✅ **E2E Tests**: 166/166 passing (100% of non-skipped)
- ✅ **Coverage**: 96.87% statements, 90.16% branches, 100% functions
- ✅ **Build**: Production build successful

### Technical Improvements
- **Test Maintainability**: Tests now accurately reflect DOM structure
- **Test Reliability**: Eliminated false failures from incorrect selectors
- **Documentation**: Clearer variable names (comingSoonIndicator vs statusIndicator)
- **Consistency**: All test files use correct, matching selectors

### Results
- **Assessment Status**: ✅ READY for new story development
- **All Quality Gates**: PASSING
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive E2E coverage maintained
- **No Regressions**: All previously passing tests still passing
