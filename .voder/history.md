Here’s a concise history of what’s been done so far:

• Project bootstrapped with `npm init –y`, Vite added as a devDependency, npm scripts (`dev`, `build`, `preview`, `test`) defined, and a `.gitignore` created.  
• Vite config was set up, an `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` surfaced, and the config was refactored to use dynamic ESM imports in CommonJS.  
• `src/index.html` was scaffolded (metadata, `<div id="root">`, `<script type="module">`), and initial “Invalid file type” errors were resolved.  
• `src/main.css` was authored with dark-mode variables, a CSS reset, terminal-style headings, neon-green link styles, and then its import error was fixed.  
• `src/main.js` was written to inject an `<h1>` hero on `DOMContentLoaded`.  
• Dev server launched via `npm run dev` (PID saved in `.voder-processes.json`); a dark background, neon-green accents, and zero console errors were confirmed.  
• CSS was enhanced with `@keyframes` for typing and fade-in animations, utility classes, and an SVG fill override.  
• JS was updated to animate the subtitle typing, then programmatically append hero, teaser, visual, philosophy, and footer sections with staggered fade-in delays.  
• SVG `<text>` elements were switched to the neon-green accent class in both JS and CSS.  
• A final `npm run dev` check returned “A background process for 'npm run dev' is already running.”

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
In the project root, run this single command to start the dev server on http://localhost:3000:

Command:
```
npm run dev
```

• Ensure you’re in the directory containing package.json before running.  
• The server will listen on port 3000 by default.

**This was the result:**
---
A background process for 'npm run dev' is already running in /Users/tomhoward/Projects/voder.ai-website.
