• Project Initialization  
  – Set up a Vite‐based npm scaffold with ESM support, dev/build/preview/test scripts and a .gitignore  

• Front-end Development & Styling  
  – Created index.html, main.css (“neon terminal” dark theme) and main.js (animated hero/content)  
  – Tweaked SVG text colors, added meta tags, eliminated console errors  

• Build & Performance Optimization  
  – Compressed production bundle (~0.4 KB HTML, 0.9 KB CSS, 1.0 KB JS)  
  – Achieved ~45–56 ms build times  

• Testing Infrastructure  
  – Installed Playwright and wrote Chromium smoke tests for page sections, SVG flow text and end-to-end checks (~1.4 s runtime)  
  – Added test to verify HTTP 200 for the Open Graph image  

• Documentation & Cleanup  
  – Authored README.md (overview, stack, commands, layout)  
  – Removed unused console logs, redundant meta tags, debug statements and stray files  

• Asset & Preview Management  
  – Organized src/assets; used Playwright to capture preview.png and set it as the Open Graph image  
  – Managed dev-server ports (5173/4173) and implemented teardown for the 4173 server  

• Builds & Verifications  
  – Ran npm run build; passed end-to-end tests in ~484 ms on Chromium  

• Content Updates  
  – Revised hero section copy in src/main.js  
  – Added “Our Why Philosophy” block  
  – Updated SVG flow text to “Business Intent → Source Prompts → Voder → Working Software.”  

• Meta Update  
  – Changed `<meta name="description">` to “Voder turns your business intent into working software—automatically.”  

• Latest Test Run  
  – Executed npm run test:e2e in the project root  
  – Smoke test failed: the `<h1>` text rendered “The Compiler for Prompts.” but the test expected “Tell Us What You Want. Let Voder Build It.”

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
In a terminal, from the project root directory, run this single command:

Command:  
```
npm run build
```

This will invoke the “build” script defined in package.json and generate/update the `dist/` folder with the production‐ready output.

**This was the result:**
---
`npm run build` completed.
