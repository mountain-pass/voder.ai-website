Here’s a distilled history of what’s been done so far:

• Project setup  
  – Created a static, ESM-only SvelteKit app (SSR off), migrated to TypeScript  
  – Replaced Reveal.js slides with GSAP/ScrollTrigger animations and added responsive dark mode  

• Testing & CI  
  – Added cross-browser Playwright E2E tests (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)  
  – Structured GitHub Actions into Build, Preview, and Test jobs, achieving 18 reliable test passes  

• Dependency audit & upgrades  
  – Reviewed ~134 packages, patched 17 vulnerabilities  
  – Upgraded Vite, Svelte, SvelteKit; reprovisioned @threlte/core; pinned key dependencies  
  – Fixed dev-server errors and restored nine broken E2E tests  

• Performance & demos  
  – Optimized CSS delivery and deferred GSAP loading  
  – Built two Threlte demos: scroll-triggered hexagon fades and a full-viewport Three.js/Threlte scene  

• Configuration, docs & cleanup  
  – Regenerated and tightened configs (svelte.config.js, tsconfig.json, vite.config.js)  
  – Streamlined imports, added an SVG flow diagram to the README  
  – Created HeroSection and StarfieldBackground components with ARIA roles; removed legacy code  

• CI artifacts & verification  
  – Produced SSR and client bundles (~444 modules) and served the site on port 4173  
  – Configured Playwright full-page screenshots; documented artifact locations  
  – Updated “Available Scripts” in README (including npm run test:e2e) and verified via grep  

• Most recent action  
  – Updated project-root package.json with final scripts, dependencies, and engines  
  – Ran npm run test:ci (build → preview → test:e2e): all 18 Playwright tests passed in ~10.5 s  
  – Executed git add --all to stage every changed, added, or deleted file
