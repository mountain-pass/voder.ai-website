Here’s a concise summary of what’s been done so far:

• Project setup  
  – Initialized an ESM-only SvelteKit + TypeScript app (SSR disabled)  
  – Replaced Reveal.js slides with GSAP/ScrollTrigger animations  
  – Added responsive dark-mode support  

• Testing & CI  
  – Wrote 21 Playwright end-to-end tests covering errors, layouts, responsiveness and key flows  
  – Configured GitHub Actions to build, deploy preview environments, and run tests on every push/PR  

• Dependency audit & upgrades  
  – Reviewed ~134 npm packages, patched 17 vulnerabilities  
  – Upgraded/pinned Vite, Svelte, SvelteKit; resolved resulting server and test errors  

• Performance & demos  
  – Deferred GSAP loading and optimized CSS delivery  
  – Built two Threlte demos: a scroll-triggered hexagon fade and a full-viewport Three.js scene  

• Configuration cleanup & documentation  
  – Streamlined svelte.config.js, tsconfig.json, vite.config.js; removed legacy code  
  – Added an SVG flowchart to README; introduced HeroSection and StarfieldBackground components  

• CI artifacts & verification  
  – Generated SSR and client bundles (~444 modules) with full-page screenshots  
  – Ran 18 unit tests and 24 E2E tests; produced two clean production builds  

• Accessibility & cross-browser testing  
  – Integrated @axe-core/playwright; audited 136 packages and flagged six new a11y issues  
  – Established a zero-critical-violation suite running 24 parallel E2E tests on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit  

• README updates, asset management & chunking  
  – Documented npm scripts (e.g. “npm run sync”), added preview.png, favicon.ico, brand-entry.png  
  – Configured manualChunks for Three.js/Threlte, GSAP/ScrollTrigger, and key components  

• Architecture decisions & linting  
  – Drafted ADR #0006 (manual chunk splitting) and ADR #0007 (ESLint/Prettier adoption)  
  – Installed ESLint with Svelte/TypeScript plugins; added a `lint` script and updated CI to run it  

• Recent linting adjustments  
  – Ran `npm run lint -- --fix`, discovered missing “lint” script; added it to package.json  
  – Removed unintended flat-config file; created `eslint.config.cjs` via FlatCompat for custom rules  

• Latest actions & outcomes  
  – Deleted the temporary `eslint.config.cjs`; modified root package.json’s `lint` script to use `.eslintrc.cjs`  
  – Ran `npm run lint` and saw it fail with code 2 due to an unsupported “root” key in the flat config  
  – Edited `.eslintrc.cjs` to remove `root: true`  

• Most recent lint run  
  – `npm run lint` now lints all files under `src/` but exits with code 2, reporting a “parser” key not supported in flat config.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Modify the file `package.json` at the project root:

1. Open `package.json`.
2. In the top-level `"scripts"` section, locate the `"lint"` entry.  
3. Change its value from:
   ```
   "lint": "eslint --config .eslintrc.cjs \"src/**/*.{js,ts,svelte}\""
   ```
   to:
   ```
   "lint": "eslint \"src/**/*.{js,ts,svelte}\""
   ```
4. Save the file.

**This was the result:**
---
Successfully generated file: package.json
