Here’s a concise history of what’s been done so far:

• Project scaffolding  
  – Initialized a SvelteKit ESM-only TypeScript app (SSR disabled)  
  – Replaced Reveal.js slides with GSAP/ScrollTrigger animations and added responsive dark mode  

• Testing & CI  
  – Wrote 21 Playwright E2E tests (console errors, hero section, responsiveness, BrandEntry, smoke tests, narratives) across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit  
  – Configured GitHub Actions to build ▶ preview ▶ test  

• Dependency audit & upgrades  
  – Audited ~134 npm packages, patched 17 vulnerabilities, resolved the rest  
  – Upgraded Vite, Svelte, SvelteKit; reprovisioned @threlte/core; pinned critical dependencies  
  – Fixed dev-server errors and restored broken tests  

• Performance optimizations & demos  
  – Deferred GSAP loading and optimized CSS delivery  
  – Created two Threlte demos (scroll-triggered hexagon fades; full-viewport Three.js/Threlte scene)  

• Configuration, documentation & cleanup  
  – Tightened svelte.config.js, tsconfig.json, vite.config.js; streamlined imports  
  – Added SVG flow diagram to README; removed legacy code  
  – Implemented HeroSection and StarfieldBackground with ARIA roles  

• CI artifacts & verification  
  – Generated SSR and client bundles (~444 modules) and full-page screenshots  
  – Updated “Available Scripts” in README and verified via grep  

• Commits & test runs  
  – Updated root package.json (scripts, deps, Node engine)  
  – Ran “npm run test:ci” (18 tests in ~10.5 s) and “npm run test:e2e” (21 tests in ~11.9 s)  
  – Committed 27 files (510 insertions, 343 deletions); tweaked HeroSection CSS  

• Build output  
  – Successfully executed “npm run build” (SvelteKit sync + Vite SSR & client)  
  – Produced server/client bundles and a static build folder  

• Latest tweaks & verifications  
  – Prepended “/” to fragment-link hrefs in HeroSection.svelte  
  – Re-ran and passed all 21 Playwright tests across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit  

• Accessibility testing setup  
  – Installed @axe-core/playwright; audited 136 packages (6 new vulnerabilities)  
  – Added tests/accessibility.spec.js asserting zero critical accessibility violations  

• Most recent test run  
  – Executed “npm run test:e2e” (24 tests across 4 workers); all passed in ~14.1 s on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit  

• Latest action  
  – Ran `git add tests/accessibility.spec.js` (completed successfully)
