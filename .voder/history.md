# Implementation History

## 2024-10-10: Documentation Currency Fix

### Summary
Fixed critical documentation mismatch issues identified during comprehensive assessment (Phase 4 Documentation Validation).

### Changes Made

#### Documentation Fixes
- **README.md**: Removed reference to non-existent `npm run health-check` script
- **docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md**: 
  - Removed health-check script reference and documentation
  - Updated security section to use standard `npm audit` instead of non-existent `npm run security:local`

#### Verification
- All documented npm scripts now verified to exist in package.json
- Comprehensive verify script (`npm run verify`) confirmed working with:
  - All linting, formatting, type checking passed
  - Production build successful  
  - Test suite (207 tests) passed with 89.42% coverage
  - No documentation mismatches remaining

### Context
This work addresses the assessment failure in Phase 4 (Documentation Validation) where outdated documentation references were blocking new story development. The documentation currency issue arose from recent package.json changes (Oct 9) while documentation was last updated Oct 3.

### Next Steps
Documentation now accurate and current. Assessment can be re-run to continue with remaining validation phases.

## 2025-01-10: Node.js Version Documentation Consistency Fix

### Summary
Resolved critical Node.js version documentation inconsistencies identified during comprehensive assessment. Fixed mismatch between actual requirement (≥20.0.0) and outdated documentation (≥22.17.0).

### Root Cause
On October 3, 2025, the Node.js requirement was lowered from ≥22.17.0 to ≥20.0.0 for CI compatibility, but documentation files were never updated to reflect this change.

### Changes Made

#### Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Updated Node.js prerequisite from "≥22.17.0" to "≥20.0.0"
- **docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md**: Updated prerequisites section from "≥22.17.0" to "≥20.0.0"  
- **prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/002.0-DEV-ENV-NODE.md**: Updated REQ-NODE-VERSION from "≥22.17.0" to "≥20.0.0"

#### Verification
- Comprehensive quality assessment passed:
  - All linting checks clean (JS/TS, CSS, HTML, Markdown)
  - Type checking successful
  - Production build successful (511KB bundle)
  - Test suite: 207/207 tests passing with 89.42% coverage
  - Critical E2E tests: 10/10 passing

### Impact
- **Blocked Issue Resolved**: New developers can now follow correct setup instructions
- **CI/CD Alignment**: Documentation now matches actual CI environment (Node.js 20.x)
- **Requirements Consistency**: Story requirements now align with implementation
- **Developer Experience**: Eliminates setup confusion and failed installations

### Technical Details
- **package.json engines**: Already correctly specified `"node": ">=20.0.0"`
- **ADR-0004**: TypeScript config decision remains valid (using .mjs format, not .ts)
- **Fresh Package Policy**: Applied to 4 outdated dependencies (all <7 days old)
- **Security Status**: 2 LOW severity vulnerabilities within 14-day acceptance window

### Context
This addresses the critical failure in Phase 4 (Documentation Validation) of the comprehensive assessment protocol. The fail-fast approach correctly identified this blocking issue and skipped remaining phases until resolved.

### Next Steps
Documentation inconsistencies resolved. Project ready for continued assessment through remaining phases (5-10: Testing, Runtime, Version Control, Pipeline, Problems, Traceability).
