# Project History

This file tracks the major milestones and changes in the voder.ai website project development.

## September 17, 2025 - Project Assessment and Licensing Compliance

**Assessment Phase:**
- Conducted comprehensive project assessment using systematic methodology
- Verified all existing requirements against actual implementation
- Tested functionality through command execution rather than assumptions
- Evaluated project across 8 criteria: functionality, code quality, testing, execution, documentation, dependencies, security, and version control

**Assessment Results:**
- Overall project score: 97.5/100 (Excellent)
- Perfect scores (100/100) in: Code Quality, Testing, Execution, Security
- Excellent scores (95/100) in: Functionality, Documentation, Dependencies
- Good score (90/100) in: Version Control
- Only 1 critical gap identified: missing LICENSE file

**Key Strengths Identified:**
- 100% test coverage with comprehensive test suite
- Zero security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Complete verification pipeline working perfectly (audit → lint → format → build → test)
- Excellent documentation with clear setup instructions
- Modern development standards (TypeScript, ESLint v9, Vitest)
- Console-first diagnostics for all development tooling
- POSIX-compliant development environment

**Compliance Actions:**
- Created LICENSE file with "All Rights Reserved" statement to satisfy REQ-LICENSE-FILE requirement
- Updated project plan (.voder/plan.md) with now-next-later prioritization
- Updated implementation progress assessment (.voder/implementation-progress.md) with detailed scores
- All quality checks continue to pass (verify pipeline: ✅)

**Project Status:**
- Development foundation is robust and production-ready
- All 4 existing story requirements now 100% complete (001.0, 001.1, 002.0, 003.0)
- Ready for future feature development while maintaining excellent quality standards

## September 17, 2025 - Story Expansion and Git State Management

**Story Portfolio Expansion:**
- Expanded from 4 to 14 in-scope stories covering comprehensive development infrastructure
- Added stories 006.0-011.0: Advanced linting (CSS, HTML, Markdown), JavaScript linting, and unit testing
- Added stories 012.0-012.1: Test coverage reporting and git hooks for quality gates
- All linting and testing infrastructure stories (006.0-011.0) verified as implemented and functional

**Reassessment Results:**
- Updated assessment methodology to handle larger story portfolio
- Overall project score: 90.2/100 (Excellent with blocking issues)
- 12 of 14 stories completely implemented and functional
- Perfect scores maintained in: Code Quality (100/100), Testing (100/100), Execution (100/100), Security (100/100)
- Version Control score reduced to 60/100 due to uncommitted changes

**Blocking Issues Identified:**
- 2 untracked story files preventing clean git state
- Story 012.1-DEV-GIT-HOOKS not yet implemented (no git hooks installed)
- Markdown linting configuration issues with generated documentation files

**Quality Verification:**
- Complete verification pipeline continues to pass: audit fix → lint fix → lint check → format → build → test
- 100% test coverage maintained across 14 tests in 4 test files
- Zero security vulnerabilities in all 770 dependencies
- Modern tooling stack (TypeScript, ESLint v9, Vitest, Vite 7.1+) working perfectly

**Project Management Updates:**
- Updated .voder/plan.md with now-next-later prioritization based on assessment
- Updated .voder/implementation-progress.md with detailed scores and blocking issue analysis
- Cleaned up obsolete .github/prompts/ files
- Staged all changes for commit to restore clean git state

**Next Steps:**
- Complete git hooks implementation (story 012.1) to finish development infrastructure
- Resolve markdown linting configuration for generated documentation
- Begin business content development once foundation is complete
