Here’s a concise recap of what’s been done so far:

1. Project setup  
   • Initialized a SvelteKit ESM app (static output, SSR off) using @sveltejs/adapter-static  
   • Resolved initial build errors to produce a working static site  

2. Testing & CI  
   • Migrated Playwright tests from CommonJS to ESM  
   • Created a test:ci workflow (build → preview → E2E)  
   • Achieved 18/18 passing E2E tests on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit  

3. Content, styling & animation  
   • Built all page sections with global dark-mode support and responsive CSS  
   • Installed GSAP + ScrollTrigger and authored an animateSlide helper  

4. Reveal.js integration → removal  
   • Added deck-init.js, Reveal.js markup, and config entries, then later removed them  

5. Dependencies & configuration  
   • Added TypeScript as a dev dependency; audited 128 packages and fixed 11 vulnerabilities  
   • Updated vite.config.js (optimizeDeps.include, ssr.noExternal) for GSAP, ScrollTrigger, and Reveal.js  

6. Verification & cleanup  
   • Ran npm run test:ci successfully across three browsers  
   • Confirmed slide-1 animations ran error-free in dev  
   • Killed stray dev-server processes; cleared import-outside-module errors  

7. CI & package updates  
   • Latest CI passed build, preview (port 4173), and all 18 tests  
   • Removed reveal.js; added GSAP (^3.x), ScrollTrigger (^3.x), and @threlte/core (^0.13.0)  

8. Scroll-trigger setup  
   • Created src/lib/scroll-init.js to register ScrollTrigger and wire up animateSlide on each section  
   • Updated +page.svelte to call initScrollAnimations(); removed all Reveal.js markup  
   • Broadened selector from “main.reveal .slides section” to “main section”  

9. Most recent cleanup  
   • Deleted obsolete tests/navigation.spec.js; tweaked +page.svelte  
   • Confirmed successful static site generation  

10. Build & test run  
    • Executed npm run sync && npm run build && npm run test:ci with zero errors; captured output in build-and-test.log  

11. Dev server start & stop  
    • Started dev server (npm run dev; pid 38172)  
    • Stopped it via “pkill -f vite” with no errors  

12. Latest action & log inspection  
    • Started Vite dev server in the background (pid 40498), logging to dev-server.log  
    • Ran `grep -En 'SSR|import error' ./dev-server.log` and saw:  
      – Error evaluating SSR module /src/deck-init.js: failed to import "gsap/ScrollTrigger"  
      – Error evaluating SSR module /src/routes/+page.svelte: failed to import "/src/deck-init.js"

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Run the following in a terminal (from the project’s root directory) to stop the Vite dev server:  
```
kill 40498
```
---

**This was the result:**
---
Process 38172 (npm run dev) is no longer running.
Stopped process 40498 (npm run dev) with SIGKILL
---
