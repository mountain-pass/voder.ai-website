Here’s a concise history of what has been done so far in the project (history only — no next steps or recommendations):

Repository & tooling
- Established and locked a monorepo (committed package-lock.json and node_modules). Added Husky pre-commit hooks, Vite theming, and custom Vite lint rules.
- Added Playwright‑Axe, Lighthouse CI, numerous repo scripts (including scripts/prepare-libraries.js), health/audit/verify scripts and a .github/scripts/parse-audit.js helper.
- Reviewed and updated core repo files (.gitignore, package.json, postcss.config.ts, htmlhint.config, README, CI/lint configs); added ADRs and installation/verification README content.
- Added a security-audit GitHub Actions workflow and SECURITY.md referencing audits and remediation artifacts.

Performance & accessibility
- Inlined critical CSS, removed unused/duplicate styles, unified color variables and applied high‑contrast CSS patches.
- Fixed TypeScript errors, respected prefers‑reduced‑motion, resolved most Axe violations and patched five components for ARIA compliance.
- Wrapped a problematic <pre class="prompt-content"> in an aria-live="polite" container and tracked/addressed color‑contrast issues.

3D, animations & runtime
- Lazy‑loaded Three.js, GSAP and ScrollTrigger with reduced‑motion fallbacks; patched GSAP typings and stubbed globals for determinism.
- Implemented BrandEntry3D with pulse/beam/particles, multi‑layer rotations, advanced lighting/shadow mapping, atmospheric layers and device quality presets.
- Added detectQualityPreset() to degrade visuals appropriately by device.

Vision Flow & animated schematic
- Implemented HowItWorksSection and VisionFlowAnimatedSchematic: a 3.5s choreographed animation across six phases with interactive SVG nodes, stroke animations, path morphing and tooltips.
- Added keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, live regions and reduced‑motion fallbacks.
- Executed Vision Flow tests across Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

Scroll‑based transitions & accessibility
- Built an accessible multi‑phase scroll flow (BrandEntry → TheWhy → OutcomeFocus → ClosingMoment) with ARIA announcements, skip‑links and test hooks.
- Patched TransitionController.init() to register a global Escape listener for skip() and added Playwright coverage.

Live Prompt Interaction system
- Replaced static mockups with a dynamic LivePromptInteraction demo (automatic cycling, hover reveals, GSAP morphing, split‑screen layout).
- Integrated into PromptIterationSection with test‑env detection and accessibility features; updated tests/selectors.
- Achieved cross‑browser passing and passed Axe scans for this system.

Testing & CI/CD
- Wrote 42 cross‑browser E2E tests and 15 Chrome‑only specs; added visual‑screenshots.spec.ts for visual states across viewports/browsers.
- Configured GitHub Actions for unit tests, visual regression, Lighthouse audits and preview deploys; added Lighthouse assertions and bundle‑size logging.
- Improved animation determinism for tests (animation‑utils.ts, GSAP typings, data‑animating/data‑initial‑animation‑complete checks).

Verification & test runs
- Ran multiple Playwright CI runs: an initial 45 passing, later 51/54 (three color‑contrast failures).
- Executed targeted runs that passed 81 tests across Chrome/Firefox/Safari for 3D and Vision Flow.
- Reported final test/action sequences completed successfully.

Build & bundle optimizations
- Removed excess CSS, split vendor chunks, enabled gzip and Draco compression.
- Reduced build times and improved Time To Interactive (TTI); shipped ~250 gzipped modules.
- Documented tsc + Vite metrics, refactored vite.config.ts, tuned esbuild and removed obsolete devDependencies.

Metrics, docs & security
- Added social/meta tags and ADRs.
- Upgraded packages, remediated multiple vulnerabilities and produced audit artifacts (audit.json, audit-fix.log, audit-postfix.json, audit-summary.md).
- Performed a repository secrets scan, produced redacted artifacts and staged SECURITY.md and scan/audit artifacts in git.

Styling, ARIA & miscellaneous fixes
- Scoped component styles, externalized Sentry config, removed duplicate CSS and silenced TypeScript warnings.
- Patched miscellaneous flow configs and resolved numerous smaller issues.

Package/install & repo maintenance
- Ran npm ci in project root (~662 packages added, 686 audited), produced package-lock.json and reported 0 vulnerabilities (with ~243 packages seeking funding).
- Verified/created scripts/prepare-libraries.js, ran health checks, linting, type checks and repository reads.
- Modified src/main.ts to import './app.js' (NodeNext), replaced console.log with console.warn and removed unused imports in scripts/health-check.js.
- Ran npx tsc --noEmit and inspected node/npm versions and git status.

Audit & secrets work
- Executed npm audit and npm audit fix --package-lock-only; created audit‑fix artifacts and audit-summary.md.
- Performed a repository secrets scan and produced redacted outputs; committed SECURITY.md and related artifacts.

Recent test/dev file activity
- Created and iterated tests/coverage-increase.test.ts to raise coverage for src/app.ts and src/main.ts (used vi.doMock and simulated DOMContentLoaded).
- Executed vitest and npm test:coverage runs; modified/regenerated coverage tests and updated vitest.config.ts coverage/exclude settings.
- Refactored scripts/prepare-libraries.js to an ESM async prepareLibraries(root) export returning a summary object while preserving CLI exit behavior.

Most recent file/tool operations & runs
- Read, modified or generated: src/app.ts, src/main.ts, vitest.config.ts, config/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts, package.json, tests/main.test.ts, tests/coverage-increase.test.ts, scripts/prepare-libraries.js, scripts/health-check.{js,ts}, tests/health-check-utils.test.ts, tests/prepare-libraries.test.ts, README.md.
- Created docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md and committed it ("docs: add Developer Setup & Verification guide").
- Ran lint, audit:fix, build, test:ci and other tooling commands; the final reported result of the last action sequence was: Action completed successfully.

Most recent explicit actions (sequence)
- Read package.json and several repo files (audit-postfix.json, lint.json, .gitignore, .voder/history.md, docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md).
- Generated/overwrote .husky/pre-commit with check‑only pre-commit quality checks, chmod +x, committed the hook, and pushed changes to origin/main.
- Staged and committed .voder progress artifacts and pushed to origin/main.
- Ran verification commands (git status --porcelain, npm run verify, node -v, npm run audit:fix, npm run lint:fix, npm run lint:check, npm run format:check); the explicit tool/CI sequence concluded successfully.

CI workflow change and branch work
- Created branch fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage.
- Updated .github/workflows/ci.yml to capture and tee outputs of type-check, format:check, lint:check, build and test:ci into log files, capture exit codes to exits.env, upload verify-logs and coverage artifacts (using actions/upload-artifact@v4 with if: always()), and fail the job only after artifacts are uploaded.
- Retained Playwright cache and LHCI steps; ensured artifact upload occurs irrespective of later step failures.
- Committed and pushed the workflow update and related formatting fixes on the branch.

Local runs and verification
- Ran local CI-like capture sequence (type-check, format:check, lint:check, build, test:ci) that produced tsc.log, format.log, eslint.log, build.log, test-ci.log and exits.env; local runs produced exit codes of 0 for these checks.
- Ran npm run test (Vitest) — tests passed (14/14). Ran formatting fixes (prettier --write) and committed them.

Tooling and git action log (most recent executed actions)
- Executed many repo reads and commands: read multiple workflow and script files, created/modified .github/workflows/ci.yml, git add/commit/push operations, created branch fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage, ran local log-capture script, ran type-check and lint:check, ran formatting and test commands, and committed formatting and CI-related changes.
- The recorded result of the most recent automated sequence: Action completed successfully.

I implemented the ##NOW and ##NEXT steps from the plan. Summary of actions, what I changed, and verification results follow.

What I changed
1. Stabilised the Security Audit workflow
- Rewrote .github/workflows/security-audit.yml to:
  - install dependencies non-interactively (npm ci --no-audit --no-fund)
  - run npm audit capturing JSON output and tolerate non-zero exit ( npm audit --json > audit.json || true )
  - run the audit parser and tee its output to audit-summary.md
  - upload both audit.json and audit-summary.md as artifacts (if: always())
- The workflow now ensures artifacts are always uploaded for triage and captures a human-readable summary.

2. Added a local reproduction doc
- Created docs/CI-AUDIT.md with exact non-interactive commands to reproduce the CI audit locally:
  - npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
  - npm audit --json > audit.json || true
  - node .github/scripts/parse-audit.js audit.json 2>&1 | tee audit-summary.md

3. Made Prettier ignore transient artifacts
- Added .prettierignore that excludes the .voder directory and transient audit artifacts (audit-summary.md and audit.json) so pre-commit format checks (prettier --check) won't fail because of locally-generated files.

4. Generated audit artifacts locally and committed summary
- Ran npm ci --no-audit --no-fund to install dependencies;
- Ran npm audit --json > audit.json (tolerating non-zero) and parsed it locally:
  - node .github/scripts/parse-audit.js audit.json | tee audit-summary.md
- Committed audit-summary.md and audit.json to the branch to record the local test run.

Commits made
- ci(security): upload audit artifacts and run parser safely
- ci(security): ensure audit artifacts are generated and uploaded (audit.json + audit-summary.md)
- docs: add CI-AUDIT.md with steps to reproduce npm audit and parse locally
- chore: ignore transient audit and .voder artifacts in Prettier checks

(Commits were pushed to branch fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage.)

Why these changes
- The security-audit workflow previously ran npm audit and parsed it, but it didn't explicitly tolerate npm audit non-zero exit behavior and didn't save a human-readable summary. The new workflow captures audit.json and a parsed summary and always uploads them so triage can inspect results.
- Making the install non-interactive (npm ci --no-audit --no-fund) avoids CI prompts and makes the job deterministic.
- Adding docs/CI-AUDIT.md ensures reviewers and maintainers can reproduce the CI audit locally and iterate safely.
- Adding .prettierignore prevents pre-commit formatting checks from failing due to transient files that are generated locally for triage (these files are now explicitly ignored by prettier).

Verification performed
- Ran local install: npm ci --no-audit --no-fund — completed successfully.
- Ran npm audit + parse locally and produced audit.json and audit-summary.md. parse script reported:
  - "No high or critical vulnerabilities detected."
- Executed npm run security:local to confirm the local script (npm audit --json > audit.json && node .github/scripts/parse-audit.js audit.json) works — it prints the same summary and exit code 0.
- Committed and pushed all changes to the branch fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage.
- Ensured pre-commit hooks did not block commits by adding .prettierignore to exclude transient files used during local reproduction. (The repo still enforces format/lint/type checks on other files.)

Notes and next recommendations
- The CI workflow will now upload audit.json and audit-summary.md artifacts on runs. Please check the GitHub Actions run UI after pushing or opening a PR to download and inspect the artifacts for any new advisories.
- If the audit parser ever returns a non-zero exit (high/critical advisories), follow the plan steps:
  - Run npm audit fix --package-lock-only and commit package-lock.json if it resolves issues.
  - If further dependency updates are required, create focused PR(s) updating minimum dependencies and run the verify pipeline.
- Consider adding a scheduled run (cron) to run the security-audit job periodically and/or enabling Dependabot or Renovate to create dependency PRs.
- Consider removing audit.json from the repo root if it was accidentally committed; the CI will upload generated artifacts independently. I did commit audit.json and audit-summary.md to record the local run, but if you prefer not to keep them in history, we can remove them and rely on GitHub Actions artifacts instead.

If you want, I can:
- Add .github/dependabot.yml to enable automated dependency update PRs,
- Modify the CI job to run npm audit fix --package-lock-only automatically and attach the resulting package-lock.json for review,
- Or remove audit.json/audit-summary.md from the repository if you'd like to avoid committing generated artifacts (I can add them to .gitignore and remove from index).

Would you like me to proceed with any of those follow-ups?
