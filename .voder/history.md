## Visual Assessment Fixes and Cube Clipping Resolution

### Changes Made

#### Visual Assessment Remediation
1. **Three.js Camera Positioning Optimization** (Initial):
   - Adjusted camera positions for proper cube viewport dominance
   - Desktop: camera.position.set(0, 10, 26) for ~60vh target
   - Tablet: camera.position.set(0, 12, 28) for ~55vh target  
   - Mobile: camera.position.set(0, 14, 30) for ~50vh target

2. **Cube Geometry Scaling** (Initial):
   - Enlarged cube from 6x6x6 to 10x10x10 units for increased visual presence

3. **Clipping Issue Resolution** (Follow-up):
   - **Problem Identified**: Cube clipping at top due to excessive size and camera proximity
   - **Solution Applied**: Balanced cube sizing and camera positioning
   - Reduced cube geometry to 7x7x7 units (optimal balance)
   - Moved cameras further back with proper clearance:
     - Desktop: camera.position.set(0, 4, 30) 
     - Tablet: camera.position.set(0, 6, 32)
     - Mobile: camera.position.set(0, 8, 35)
   - Adjusted FOV values for improved framing

4. **Tagline Visibility**: 
   - Set .hero-title opacity: 1 for immediate visibility

### Visual Assessment Results
- **Initial Assessment**: BLOCKED (insufficient cube dominance)
- **Post-Remediation**: PASS (meets viewport requirements)
- **Post-Clipping Fix**: PASS (proper dominance without artifacts)

### Automated Testing
- **Screenshot Tests**: All 19 tests PASSING ✓
- **Build Status**: Successful
- **Coverage**: Desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile (portrait & landscape)
