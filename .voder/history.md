Here’s a concise summary of what we’ve done so far:

• Bootstrapped an ESM npm package with Vite  
  – Configured build, dev, preview and test scripts  
  – Created a neon-terminal demo and recorded bundle-size/timing benchmarks  

• Added Playwright smoke tests (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)  
  – Chained build → preview → E2E in GitHub Actions (`npm run test:ci`)  
  – Published a status badge and authored three ADRs  

• Cleaned up legacy files and overhauled README  
  – Added styling guidance, global-styles snippets and auto-injected breakpoints  
  – Tweaked CSS accent colors and mobile/tablet media queries  

• Built responsive-design tests (`tests/responsive.spec.js`)  
  – Verified container padding and heading sizes at 640×800 & 1024×768  
  – Captured screenshots and got CI passing after starting the background server  

• Integrated Reveal.js presentation framework  
  – Installed Reveal.js, updated `index.html`, wrote init scripts and four sample slides  

• Performed general cleanup  
  – Removed unused root div and stray scripts; stopped stray dev servers; emptied `src/main.js`  

• Stabilized smoke tests and expanded coverage  
  – Replaced a flaky SVG assertion; added checks for hero `<h1>`, meta tags, effects, text blocks, SVG count, OG image status, document title/OG metadata and footer  

• Achieved consistently green CI runs with nine E2E smoke tests across three browsers (one retry each)  

• Added end-to-end navigation tests (`tests/navigation.spec.js`)  
  – Validated keyboard navigation (arrow keys) and deep-linking via slide hashes  
  – Patched URL assertions to use `toHaveURL(...)`  

• Ran full CI suite (`npm run test:ci`), then end-to-end tests (`npm run test:e2e`)  
  – 15 Playwright tests across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit—all passing in ~10–11 s  

• Updated documentation  
  – Added navigation checks to README’s E2E section  
  – Generated `adr-0004-use-revealjs.md` detailing the Reveal.js decision  

• Final cleanup  
  – Removed the unused entry-point file (`rm src/main.js`)
