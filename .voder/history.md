Here’s a concise history of what’s been done so far in the project:

• Project Initialization  
  – Scaffolded a Vite-based ESM npm package with build/dev/preview/test scripts  
  – Added a neon-terminal demo and bundle-size/timing benchmarks  

• Testing & CI Setup  
  – Introduced Playwright smoke tests (mobile/tablet) and a full E2E suite  
  – Configured GitHub Actions (build → preview → E2E)  
  – Documented architectural decisions in ADR-0001 through ADR-0004  

• Cleanup & Documentation  
  – Removed legacy files, tightened .gitignore, cleaned up markup  
  – Expanded README with styling guidelines, breakpoints, global styles, CSS examples, and navigation/E2E instructions  

• Reveal.js Integration  
  – Installed Reveal.js, created sample slides, patched index.html for local bundling  

• E2E Coverage Expansion  
  – Pruned unused markup and flaky assertions  
  – Added Playwright checks for headers, meta/OG tags, content blocks, SVG counts, footer elements, and visual effects  
  – Stabilized tests with retries; count grew from 15 to 18 across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit  

• Performance & Build Metrics  
  – Production builds in ~250 ms; CI installs 85 packages in 10–12 s with 0 vulnerabilities  
  – E2E suite runs in ~8.8 s; previews served on ports 4173–4179  

• Final Verifications & Tweaks  
  – Removed external CDN references from dist/index.html  
  – Added console-error smoke test; fixed “OK is not defined” error  
  – Updated .gitignore for logs/server files; enabled on-failure screenshots and trace retention  

• Git & Process Management  
  – Resolved git-add failures on ignored paths and terminated stray background servers  

• CI & npm Verifications  
  – `npm run test:ci` now builds for production, serves a preview, and runs 18 passing E2E tests on all three browsers  
  – `npm ci` installs 85 packages, audits dependencies, and reports 0 vulnerabilities  

• Test Enhancements  
  – Updated smoke and console tests to capture full-page screenshots with dynamic filenames  
  – Added screenshot steps for keyboard navigation and deep-linking  
  – Standardized new screenshot locations; removed the old folder structure  

• Most Recent Changes  
  – Patched tests (smoke.spec.js, console.spec.js, responsive.spec.js) for dynamic screenshot paths under `outputs/screenshots/`  
  – Validated full CI pipeline: production build, preview serve, and 18 passing E2E tests across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit  
  – Removed the entire `tests/screenshots/` directory  

• Latest Action & Result  
  – Ran `npm run test:ci`, which:  
    • Built the site with vite in ~289 ms (dist/index.html ~2.85 kB gzip)  
    • Served a preview (ports tried 4173–4179)  
    • Executed 18 Playwright tests across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit in ~13.2 s, all passing (exit code 0)  
  – Regenerated screenshots under `outputs/screenshots/` successfully.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
In the project root, run the following command to locate all references to the old screenshots folder:

```bash
grep -R 'tests/screenshots' .
```
---

**This was the result:**
---
`grep -R tests/screenshots .` completed.
Output:
./.voder/history.md:  – Modified tests/responsive.spec.js to update screenshot paths from `tests/screenshots/` to `outputs/screenshots/`  
./.voder/history.md:  – Ran `rm -rf tests/screenshots/`, resulting in the removal of the entire `tests/screenshots` directory.
./.voder/plan.md:Search the project for any leftover references to `tests/screenshots` (for example with `grep -R 'tests/screenshots' .`) and remove or update them so that all screenshot paths point to `outputs/screenshots/`.
./.voder/plan.md:- Delete the deprecated `tests/screenshots/` folder if it still exists.
./.voder/plan.md:- Remove any documentation or comments (in `README.md`, ADRs, etc.) that mention `tests/screenshots`.
