Here’s a concise history of what’s been done so far:

1. Project Setup  
   • Bootstrapped an ESM npm package with Vite (build/dev/preview/test scripts)  
   • Added a neon-terminal demo plus bundle-size and timing benchmarks  

2. Testing & CI  
   • Introduced Playwright smoke tests (mobile/tablet) and a full E2E suite on Chromium, Firefox, WebKit  
   • Configured GitHub Actions pipeline (build → preview → E2E) and documented architecture decisions in ADR-0001 through ADR-0004  

3. Cleanup & Documentation  
   • Removed legacy files, tightened .gitignore, cleaned up markup  
   • Expanded README with styling guidelines, breakpoints, global styles, CSS snippets, navigation and E2E instructions  

4. Reveal.js Integration & E2E Expansion  
   • Installed Reveal.js, created sample slides, patched local bundling  
   • Pruned unused markup and flaky assertions; added checks for headers, meta/OG tags, content blocks, SVG counts, footer, visual effects  
   • Stabilized tests (added retries) and grew the suite from 15 to 18 E2E tests  

5. Performance & Metrics  
   • Production builds in ~250–289 ms; CI installs 85 packages in 10–12 s with zero vulnerabilities  
   • E2E suite runs in ~8.8–13.2 s; preview servers on ports 4173–4179; gzip bundle ~2.85 KB  

6. Final Verifications & Tweaks  
   • Removed external CDN references; added a console-error smoke test; fixed an “OK is not defined” error  
   • Enabled on-failure screenshots and trace retention; updated .gitignore; resolved stray servers and git-add issues  

7. CI & npm Checks  
   • `npm ci` installs exactly 85 packages, audits zero vulnerabilities  
   • `npm run test:ci` builds production, serves a preview, and runs 18 passing E2E tests across three browsers  

8. Test Enhancements & Structure  
   • Updated smoke and console tests for full-page screenshots with dynamic names  
   • Added screenshot steps for keyboard navigation and deep linking; standardized screenshot folders; removed old structure  

9. Recent Commits & Results  
   • Commit b71c546: 138 insertions, 83 deletions; added tests/console.spec.js  
   • `npm run test:ci`: 268 ms build, preview on port 4179, 18 tests in ~10.8 s, screenshots under outputs/screenshots/, exit code 0  
   • `npm ci`: clean install in ~2 s, audits 86 packages, 16 funding-eligible, 0 vulnerabilities  

10. Dev Server Verification  
    • `npm run dev` starts Vite server at http://localhost:4173 with no errors (pid 16705)  

11. Latest E2E Run  
    • Ran `npm run test:e2e`: 18 tests passed across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit in ~10.7 s with no failures  

12. Most Recent Action  
    • Executed `kill 16705` → Stopped process 16705 (npm run dev) with SIGKILL
