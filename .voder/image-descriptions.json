    "description": "The image is a purely visual, highly stylized 3D illustration—no text or labels—designed to serve as a brand-entry or logo-type element for the Voder pre-launch site. Centered on a pitch-black background, it depicts a gently rounded cube, its edges softly chamfered so the form feels almost organic rather than mechanical. The cube’s faces are translucent, revealing a network of sinuous, wave-like strands of light flowing just beneath the surface. Those strands pulse in a cool teal-blue hue—evocative of the “Soft Teal Glow” accent in the brand palette—and subtly shift in brightness, as if liquid or energy is circulating within the form.\n\nHighlights and reflections along the cube’s top and side faces give it depth, while the interior glow lines create a sense of motion and intelligence, hinting at the product’s core promise: seamlessly transforming abstract intent (prompts) into concrete structure. There are no harsh edges or bright color contrasts beyond the dark background and glowing lines, reinforcing the minimalist, premium, and cinematic tone described in the brand guide. The overall effect is one of calm confidence—a quietly living object that draws you in without shouting—perfect for introducing the “Voder” experience before any copy or navigation appears.",

    "description": "This image appears to be the very first view of the Voder pre-launch site—the “brand entry” or hero frame that sets the mood for what follows. Here’s what’s on screen:\n\n• Background & Overall Feel  \n  – A deep, near-black canvas (the “Voder Black” surface) fills the screen, giving a sense of infinite space.  \n  – The lighting is subtle and cinematic, with just enough detail to suggest depth without revealing any distracting textures.  \n\n• Logo / Title  \n  – Centered near the top is the word “Voder” in crisp, white letters.  \n  – The typeface is clean and geometric, evoking the modern sans-serif headlines defined in the brand guide.  \n\n• 3D Cube Illustration  \n  – Below the logo floats a gently rounded cube, its edges soft rather than sharp.  \n  – The cube’s faces are translucent with a muted teal-blue glow dancing beneath the surface—thin sinuous lines that pulse and flow, as if energy is circulating inside.  \n  – Highlights and reflections on the cube’s top and side faces add dimensionality, while the interior strands of light create an almost living, breathing quality.  \n\n• Tagline / Caption  \n  – Under the floating cube, in the same white text, sits the question:  \n      “What if your prompts were the source?”  \n  – This line uses generous letter-spacing and balanced margins to align with the site’s minimalist, premium tone.  \n\n• Purpose & Tone  \n  – There are no navigation menus, forms, or calls to action—just a quiet invitation to scroll further.  \n  – The effect is one of calm confidence and intrigue, hinting at a system that can turn simple “prompts” into meaningful structure.  \n  – Together, the black-field layout, glowing teal accents, and terse copy function as a high-trust, cinematic introduction—exactly the kind of teaser experience the prompt files describe for Voder’s brand entry.",

    "description": "This image presents a single, softly glowing 3-dimensional cube suspended against an almost pitch-black field. There is no text or other elements—just the cube and its dark backdrop. Here’s what you’d notice if you couldn’t see it directly:\n\n• Shape & Form  \n  – A geometric cube with gently rounded edges and corners, so that it reads as both precise and organic rather than harsh or mechanical.  \n  – Its six faces are semi-transparent, giving the impression of frosted glass or a very thin membrane.\n\n• Internal Detail & Lighting  \n  – Beneath the translucent surfaces you can just make out a network of flowing, wave-like ribbons of light. These strands trace smooth, curving paths from one face to another.  \n  – The glow is a cool teal-blue—bright enough to be clearly visible on the dark background, but never garish or high-contrast, more like a quiet pulse of energy.  \n  – Wherever those internal ribbons touch the “walls” of the cube, the surface itself brightens in a small soft bloom, drawing your eye to the fluid motion inside.\n\n• Surface & Material  \n  – The outer faces are subtly reflective: you can see very faint highlights along their top and side edges, as if a distant light source is grazing the form.  \n  – There is no specular “shiny” gloss—these reflections are muted, contributing to the premium, almost jewel-like quality of the shape.\n\n• Background & Mood  \n  – The background is an uninterrupted near-black. It frames the cube in a void, giving the object the feeling of floating in space.  \n  – There are no gradients, patterns, or other distractions—just the negative space that emphasizes the cube’s quiet presence.\n\n• Purpose & Use  \n  – It reads like a brand-entry illustration or an advanced “favicon”-style icon: abstract enough to suggest mystery and conceptual depth, yet concrete enough to feel like a standalone logo symbol.  \n  – Its minimalist composure and kinetic interior imply a system that’s intelligent, adaptive, and energy-driven—perfect for introducing a product whose core promise is “turning prompts into structure.”  \n\nIn short, this is not a literal photograph or diagram, but a polished 3D emblem—its glowing interior and muted, translucent shell working together to evoke a sense of calm confidence, premium design, and latent motion.",

    "description": "This image is a full-screen “metaphor” slide—part of Voder’s narrative journey—set against a near-pitch-black backdrop. Everything is rendered in shades of white and light gray to maximize contrast and maintain a minimalist, cinematic feel.\n\nLayout & Structure  \n• At the very top, centered, is a large headline in a crisp, serif-inspired typeface:  \n  “You’ve been in the passenger seat.”  \n  It reads like a statement of fact, inviting reflection.  \n\n• Below that sits a simple, flowing line diagram. A thin, curved path connects four evenly spaced nodes:  \n  – The first node, labeled “Idea,” is a solid white circle—bright and prominent.  \n  – The second node, “Design,” is a slightly dimmer circle in light gray.  \n  – The third node, “Code,” is another pale gray dot further along the curve.  \n  – The final node, “Ship,” is a faint circle at the far right.  \n  A smooth, single-stroke line weaves through these points, suggesting forward momentum from conception to delivery.\n\n• Farther down, two lines of body copy in a clear, modern sans-serif appear:  \n  “Tools like Copilot and Cursor help you steer… but you’re still  \n   stuck giving directions.”  \n  This text sits in medium-weight white, split onto two lines for readability, and softly fades into view.\n\n• Beneath that is a closing question in a slightly heavier weight:  \n  “What if your system already knew the destination?”  \n  This line is brighter and bolder, serving as the rhetorical pivot toward Voder’s promise.\n\nColor & Contrast  \n• Background: pure Voder Black (essentially #000)  \n• Headline and body text: Paper White (#FFFFFF) for maximum legibility (19.6:1 contrast)  \n• Diagram line and dots: light gray tones (≈ Cool Grey #C6CBD4) to distinguish them from text without overpowering  \n• No other hues—keeps the focus on the narrative and ensures WCAG-compliant contrast.\n\nPurpose & Tone  \nThis slide conveys the core metaphor (passenger vs. navigator). It highlights how existing tools still leave you “giving directions,” then teases the idea of a tool that already “knows the destination.” There are no interactive controls visible here—just a cinematic, scroll-triggered snapshot meant to emotionally frame Voder as more than an autocomplete or code helper.\n\nARIA & Accessibility Notes (as per spec)  \n• Background illustration treated as decorative; critical text is plain HTML  \n• Headline is a semantic h1 (or h2 depending on hierarchy)  \n• Body copy uses paragraph tags with sufficient line spacing  \n• Motion tied to scroll, with `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback disabling any animated path drawing  \n\nIn essence, this visual is a distilled journey line: Idea → Design → Code → Ship, overlaid with crisp copy, all designed to make the viewer feel like they’ve been relegated to the passenger seat—and to set up Voder as the vehicle that will finally let them take the driver’s position.",

    "description": "This frame is the “Outcome Focus” slide in the Voder teaser—essentially a benefits overview laid over a deep, near-black canvas. Here’s what you’d see:\n\n• Background & Mood  \n  – A very dark backdrop (almost pure black) with just a whisper of texture or vignette at the edges to keep it from feeling flat.  \n  – No busy patterns—everything is about contrast between light copy and dark ground.\n\n• Benefit Lines (Bullet List)  \n  – Four concise value statements, each introduced by a familiar emoji icon rather than a heavy graphic. From top to bottom you get:  \n    1. A small rocket (🚀) followed by “Deliver faster without losing control”  \n    2. A target symbol (🎯) and “Align product, brand, and tech from day one”  \n    3. A light-bulb icon (💡) and “Iterate on ideas, not implementations”  \n    4. A circular arrow (🔄) and “Make fewer handoffs. Create fewer misunderstandings.”  \n  – Each line is set in a clean white sans-serif with generous spacing—enough room that your eye easily jumps from icon to text without feeling crowded.\n\n• Anchor Headline  \n  – Below the bullet list sits the big, bold payoff line in oversized type:  \n      “Outcomes, not overhead.”  \n  – This is the focal point—large, white, and centered horizontally, giving a sense of calm confidence.\n\n• Supporting Subtext  \n  – Directly beneath that headline is a smaller, lighter-weight line of copy:  \n      “Voder bridges the gap between strategy and shipping—without adding layers, delays, or drift.”  \n  – It’s set in the same white tone but with reduced size and weight, serving as a clarifying tagline.\n\n• Typography & Color  \n  – All text is pure white (Paper White on Voder Black) for maximum contrast and legibility.  \n  – The font feels modern and geometric (in keeping with the brand’s Inter/Satoshi styling).  \n  – The emoji icons add a spark of color (red, yellow, teal, etc.) but are used sparingly—subtle accents rather than screaming blue or green.\n\n• Layout & Purpose  \n  – Vertically stacked, center-aligned content that reads like a Persuasive List → Pillar Statement → Elaboration.  \n  – No navigation or controls—this screen exists purely to crystallize “what you get” by using Voder (speed, alignment, iteration, simplicity).  \n  – It’s the narrative bridge from the “prompt-driven demo” into the final brand stamp.\n\nOverall, it’s a minimalist, high-contrast benefits summary that uses simple icons and bold copy to reinforce the idea that Voder is about delivering real outcomes—no extra overhead.",

You can make out little “windows” labeled things like “webpack.config.js” or bits of pseudo-code such as “var App.esx import path…”. Hand-drawn style arrows thread between these fragments, and on the right you see two tiny boxes labeled “UI” and “REST API” with arrows connecting them.  \n\nNothing in the background is meant to be read in detail—these ghosted panels and lines simply evoke the sense of chaos and fragmentation that developers face when stitching together disparate tools and files.

Top-left “prompt” panel  \n   • A small, softly rounded rectangle, barely lighter than the background.  \n   • In the upper corner a grey label reads “Tone,” and below it, in bright white text, “Casual, confident, modern.”  \n   • It evokes the idea of a prompt editor or input card—what you feed into Voder.\n\n2. Center-left headline panel  \n   • Below (and slightly in front of) the prompt card sits the primary message area.  \n   • A giant, high-contrast headline in a modern serif reads:  \n       “Change the prompt.  \n        Not the team.”  \n   • Beneath that, in mid-weight cool grey, is a two-line pitch:  \n       “With Voder, your intent drives product delivery.  \n        No briefs. No handoffs. No misalignment.”  \n   • The text sits in generous white space, its crisp letters floating as if on a stage.\n\n3. Right-side UI card  \n   • Another softly rounded rectangle, slightly larger, containing a mini “product” or “landing” panel.  \n   • A bold statement in white sans-serif declares: “Begin your journey.”  \n   • Below it is a single, pill-shaped button edge-outlined in muted grey with white text: “Get Started.”  \n   • This panel dramatizes the result of changing the prompt—an instant UI transformation.\n\nAcross all three elements, corners are rounded, outlines are subtle, and all text is either pure white or cool-grey against the nearly black backdrop.

Those interior strands swirl and undulate in darker and lighter shades of teal, suggesting a flowing, almost living energy at the heart of the form.\n\nThe cube itself has no harsh edges: each corner and face blends smoothly into the next, giving it an organic, almost tactile quality. Narrow highlights trace along the edges and folds, catching an imaginary light source just off-screen and reinforcing the sense of depth and volume. The glow from the cube softly halos outward, subtly illuminating the surrounding area.\n\nBehind the cube, the background is a uniform field of near-black speckled with extremely fine blue and green digital noise—think of a very high-contrast static or starfield effect that never distracts but adds a quiet texture. There is no text, no buttons, no other graphical elements—just this single, centered shape on a dark canvas.\n\nPurpose-wise, this graphic functions as a high-concept emblem or teaser logo: it conveys minimalism and premium quality, hints at dynamic, internal complexity (energy, data, or “prompts” brought to life), and sets a cinematic, futuristic tone without saying a single word.

Middle: Below the wordmark is a three-dimensional cube floating in space. The cube’s faces are slightly rounded and translucent, with softly chamfered edges. Inside the cube you can see undulating, wave-like ribbons of light in a cool teal-blue hue. These internal strands of light appear to pulse or flow, lending the object a quiet, living quality.

Let Voder Build It.”).",
