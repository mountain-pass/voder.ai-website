    "description": "This image is a minimalist 3-dimensional cube rendered against a near-black background. Visually, it reads as a decorative, conceptual object—potentially a hero-stage asset or logo placeholder—rather than a functional UI screenshot. Here are the key details:\n\n• Overall Layout  \n  – A single semi-transparent cube floats dead-center on a pitch-dark canvas.  \n  – There is no text, no UI chrome and no other elements in the frame.  \n\n• Form and Material  \n  – The cube’s six faces are smoothly rounded at the edges.  \n  – Its surfaces are subtly translucent, revealing softly undulating “flow lines” or wave-like streaks inside.  \n  – Those internal curves shimmer in a soft teal-blue hue, creating the impression of fluid motion trapped within a geometric form.  \n\n• Color and Lighting  \n  – Background: virtually pure black (no visible gradient or texture).  \n  – Highlights: a calm teal glow (#24D1D5-ish) traces the interior waves and accents the cube’s corners.  \n  – Shadows: the cube blends into darkness at its edges, emphasizing its internal luminescence.  \n\n• Intended Role  \n  – Looks like a high-concept 3D “prompt cube” or brand-entry object—something to capture intrigue before any copy or navigation appears.  \n  – Feels cinematic, minimalist and premium, suggesting depth and motion even in a still frame.  \n\n• Deviations from the Specification  \n  – There is no “Voder” wordmark or tagline overlaid; the spec calls for a typed-in “Voder” logo and subtitle.  \n  – No ambient particle drift or background glow beyond the cube itself. The design files describe cosmic mist or particle fields behind the object.  \n  – The cube appears static here; spec’d interactions (orbiting motion, soft pulses) are not visible in a single frame.  \n  – No skip link, hero copy, or ARIA landmarks accompany the canvas—whereas the prompt files mandate accessible markup around the brand-entry scene.  \n\nIn sum, this is a striking, self-contained 3D asset—but as a standalone image it lacks the textual branding, background ambience, and accessibility annotations described for the Voder pre-launch “Brand Entry” section.",

    "description": "This is a flat, two-color icon sitting on a white square canvas. At its core is the familiar Vite mark—not a wordmark or brand-entry animation, but the default Vite “lightning bolt” emblem:\n\n • A solid magenta-purple triangular backdrop (forming a stylized “V” shape) fills most of the frame.  \n • Overlaid on that triangle is a bright yellow, angular lightning-bolt shape that bisects and extends beyond the purple field. The bolt is sharp-edged, geometric, and offset slightly forward, giving the impression of movement or energy.  \n\nThere is no text, tagline, or additional graphic detail—just those two overlapping shapes in high-contrast pinkish-purple (#DA2EFF-ish) and yellow (#FFEA00-ish) on white. No drop shadows, gradients, glow or 3D modeling are present. The icon appears centered, with generous white space on all sides.\n\nPurpose & Context  \n• This looks exactly like the default Vite build tool logo. It functions as a simple app-icon or favicon: it’s immediately recognizable to developers familiar with Vite, but it carries none of the bespoke, narrative-driven styling called for by the Voder pre-launch spec.  \n\nHow it diverges from the Voder specification  \n• Brand Palette & Mood: The spec demands a dark, cinematic “Voder Black” background (#0A0A0A) with subtle teal-glow accents. Here, we have a bright white canvas and neon pink/yellow, which clash with the intended minimalist, high-trust tone.  \n• Shape & Metaphor: Voder’s opening scene is meant to feature a softly pulsing 3D cube or lattice object in WebGL, not a flat, mechanical bolt. There’s no evidence of orbit, particle drift, or depth.  \n• Typography & Copy: The image lacks any “Voder” lettering, tagline, or screen-reader accessible markup around it. According to the prompts, there should be an H1 “Voder” and a “The Compiler for Prompts” subtitle. None of that appears.  \n• Accessibility & Structure: No ARIA landmarks or skip links accompany this asset. The spec requires a semantic wrapper (`<section aria-label=\"Voder brand introduction\">`) around any decorative canvas. This stand-alone icon delivers no structural or narrative context.  \n\nIn sum, while this image clearly serves as the Vite logo, it does not match the brand, color palette, motion-driven 3D object, or accessible narrative scaffolding described for the Voder pre-launch “Brand Entry” section.",

    "description": "This image reads like the hero banner for voder.ai’s pre-launch site — a simple, cinematic “first look” that combines the wordmark, a 3D motif, and a single provocative line of copy. Here’s how it’s composed:\n\n1. Overall Layout & Purpose  \n   - Full-screen, single-column, scroll-or-load entry point (no visible navigation or buttons).  \n   - Serves as an introduction or “brand entry” scene: logo on top, abstract 3D object center, headline copy below.  \n\n2. Background & Color  \n   - Very dark, near-black canvas (close to Voder Black #0A0A0A).  \n   - No gradients or busy patterns — just a uniform dark field that isolates the central elements.  \n\n3. Logo / Wordmark  \n   - The word “Voder” appears in bright white, centered at the top.  \n   - Typeface is a clean, modern geometric sans-serif (in line with Inter/Satoshi/Neue Haas guidelines).  \n   - There is no subtitle (“The Compiler for Prompts”) in this shot — only the primary logo wordmark.  \n\n4. 3D Motif  \n   - Centered beneath the wordmark is a softly glowing cube.  \n   - The cube is rendered as a semi-transparent, fluid-lined form rather than a hard-edged polyhedron.  \n   - Internal rippling light veins or “flows” shimmer in a subtle teal/blue tone (evoking Soft Teal Glow #24D1D5 but a bit more subdued).  \n   - This stands in for the “prompt cube” concept described in the spec, though here it feels more like flowing liquid glass than a faceted object.  \n   - There’s no visible motion in the still, but it suggests a breathing, pulsing quality.  \n\n5. Tagline / Headline Copy  \n   - Below the cube, in white text, is a single line split over two lines:  \n     “What if your prompts  \n     were the source?”  \n   - This question-style headline is not one of the exact lines called out in the prompt files (e.g. “Tell Us What You Want. Let Voder Build It.” or “We believe software should start with intent.”), so it looks like a new variation on the brand’s narrative.  \n   - Typography for this copy matches the brand’s body style (Inter/Helvetica Neue light-to-regular).  \n\n6. Accessibility & Spec-Alignment Notes  \n   - Matches the “Brand Entry” spec in tone (dark background, single 3D canvas, minimal text).  \n   - Differs from the prompt files by using “What if your prompts were the source?” instead of the documented hero lines.  \n   - The 3D cube is more fluid and abstract than the “faceted lattice” or simple “cube.glb” placeholder described.  \n   - There are no visible ARIA labels, skip links, or structural HTML landmarks in this screenshot — presumably those are implemented in the code around this visual.  \n\nIn summary, it’s a minimalist hero image combining the white “Voder” logo, a glowing, fluid-lined cube, and a single question-style line of copy. The styling is fully on-brand in color, type, and mood, even though the exact headline text and cube style differ slightly from the written spec.",

No visible 3D objects or textures—just a soft vignette or gentle spotlight in the center.  \n\n• Main Text (center-aligned, vertically stacked)  \n  1. “Voder”  \n     • Large, bold white type (likely set in a geometric sans-serif).  \n  2. “The Compiler for Prompts.”  \n     • Medium-sized white text, semi-bold or regular weight.  \n     • Includes a trailing period.  \n  3. “Coming soon.”  \n     • Same styling as the line above but slightly smaller and with a lowercase “s” in “soon.”  \n\n• Footer Text (near bottom of the frame)  \n  – “Built with Voder” in small white text, centered.  \n  – Unlike the spec’s example (“Built with Voder. (Of course.)”), this line omits the parenthetical nod and trailing period.  \n\n• Purpose & Context  \n  – Serves as the final “closing moment” or teaser end-card for the voder.ai pre-launch site: a quietly confident sign-off that the product is on the way.  \n  – No interactive elements, no visible logos or hover-effects—purely a static reminder.  \n\n• Matches vs. Spec Discrepancies  \n  Matches  \n   • Dark background fading to black.  \n   • Center-aligned hierarchy: product name → tagline → coming soon message → built-with credit.  \n   • White text meeting high contrast requirements.  \n\n  Discrepancies  \n   • The spec suggests a soft Teal glow accent on the final logo or pulsing animations—none are visible here.  \n   • The spec’s “Built with Voder. (Of course.)” copy is trimmed to just “Built with Voder.” and lacks the parenthetical.  \n   • “Coming soon.” is rendered with a lowercase “s” and a period; spec uses “Coming Soon.” (title-style capitalization).  \n   • No actual logo graphic or SVG—only the wordmark “Voder.”  \n\nOverall, this image reads as the final, minimalist “fade-to-black” card closing out the voder.ai narrative, but in a pared-down form compared to the fully animated, branded version laid out in the prompt files.",

Subtle, undulating wave-like patterns run through its interior faces—these patterns glow ever so faintly with a pale icy blue light, as if there’s a soft internal illumination. The cube’s edges are rounded slightly, and there’s a very gentle drop shadow beneath it that helps it hover above the white plane.\n\nBecause it’s purely an abstract 3D object without any lettering or explicit branding, it feels like a placeholder or a visual motif rather than a finished logo. In the context of the Voder site spec, one might assume this is intended as the “prompt cube” introduced in the Brand Entry section—an intriguing object that draws you in before the logo and tagline appear. However, two things don’t align with what the prompt files describe:\n\n1. Background color: The prompt calls for a dark (Voder Black or Deep Navy) stage for the Brand Entry, whereas this cube is shown on a stark white field.  \n2. Accent glow: The brand guide specifies a Soft Teal Glow (#24D1D5) accent, but the cube’s internal light is cooler and more bluish-white than the warm teal hue in the spec.\n\nOverall, it reads as a high-end, minimalist 3D illustration or icon—clean, reflective, and slightly mysterious—but it would need to be placed over the correct dark background and tinted with the branded teal glow to match the Voder pre-launch aesthetic.",

    "description": "This image presents a single, central 3-D object floating against an almost-pure black background. At first glance it reads as a softly glowing cube, but on closer inspection its six faces are subtly curved and semi-transparent, and within each face you can see gently undulating, ribbon-like bands of light. Those bands ebb and flow in a teal-ish gradient—brighter in the center of the cube and fading toward the edges—creating the impression of moving currents of energy trapped inside a dark glass form.\n\nNo text or interface chrome is visible—just the object itself, perfectly centered and filling roughly one-third of the frame. The background is so dark it reads as true Voder Black (#0A0A0A), though because the cube’s glow spills a very faint halo around its edges it never quite feels empty. There are no on-screen controls, captions or labels, reinforcing its role as a purely decorative brand element rather than a navigational or informational graphic.\n\nPurpose & Context  \n• This feels like a “hero asset” or opening brand entry canvas for the voder.ai pre-launch site: a mysterious 3D prompt cube or lattice that draws you in before any text appears.  \n• In the specs we know the Brand Entry section uses a WebGL canvas marked aria-hidden=\"true\" and would be wrapped in a section role=\"banner\" with aria-label=\"Voder brand introduction.\" This image matches that intent, though here it’s rendered with fluid waves of light rather than a hard-edged faceted cube.  \n\nMatches the Prompt Files?  \n• Color Palette: The internal glow is in the right family of “Soft Teal Glow” but leans slightly bluer and cooler than the specified #24D1D5 accent. Otherwise it sits correctly on a black field.  \n• Form: The prompt docs mention an orbiting faceted cube or lattice of prompt fragments. Here the form is more organic—smooth-cornered and filled with fluid light—so it departs from the “prompt cube” polyhedron concept.  \n• Text & Accessibility: As required, there is no visible text, social links, or navigational elements. In production we’d mark this canvas aria-hidden and supply a skip-link to reach main content; the static image itself has no textual overlay.  \n\nIn sum, this illustration serves as a purely atmospheric opening visual—a hypnotic, softly pulsing 3D cube-like form that aligns with the cinematic, minimalist brand entry but diverges from the more geometric “prompt cube” described in the spec.",

The colors and contrast adhere to the brand guide—pure white text on black for primary messaging, and a light grey for secondary graphical elements, ensuring AAA contrast.\n\nPurpose-wise, this screen serves as the “Metaphor” phase in the overall narrative: it visualizes the traditional development journey (“Idea → Design → Code → Ship”) and sets up the notion that you’ve been relegated to a “passenger” giving directions to tools that still require step-by-step guidance.

Canvas & Background  \n   • The entire scene sits on a near-black background (Voder Black #0A0A0A).  \n   • Behind the text you can just make out semi-transparent windows or cards—little boxes containing random file names (e.g. “button.stonks.tsv”, “webpack.config.js”, “var App.esx”) and fragments of code. They’re rendered in a very soft gray—intended to look like noisy, swirling debris.  \n   • Thin curved arrows and lines weave between those code-panel placeholders, suggesting chaotic connections or data flows. On the right there’s a small “UI” box pointing into a “REST API” box, reinforcing the sense of fragmented tooling.\n\n2. Primary Heading  \n   • Large, crisp, white text (Paper White #FFFFFF) at the top center reads:  \n     “The problem isn’t your tools.”  \n   • This matches the spec’s key message for the Problem Space section.\n\n3. Secondary Heading  \n   • Immediately underneath, in a slightly smaller weight, is:  \n     “It’s the gap between your ideas and your implementation.”  \n   • This line is also white or very light gray, preserving strong contrast.\n\n4. Body Copy  \n   • Below that, in a normal paragraph size, is a three-line statement:  \n     “Developers stitch together frameworks, boilerplate, and brittle glue code —  \n     all to approximate what you actually meant.”  \n   • That text is a cool-gray tone (in practice appears almost white), consistent with the brand-guide’s Cool Grey (#C6CBD4) for secondary text.\n\n5. Layout & Purpose  \n   • Everything is centered horizontally, with generous negative space around the text block.  \n   • The faint, decorative code fragments and arrows fill the background but are marked “aria-hidden” in the spec—here they’re purely illustrative of the “fragmentation and chaos” problem.  \n   • No visible buttons or navigation—this is meant as an immersive, scroll-tied transition into the narrative.\n\n6. Conformance to Prompts  \n   • The wording of headline and copy matches exactly the “Transition: The Why → Problem Space” draft.  \n   • Colors (white text on black) meet the stated 19.6:1 and 11.7:1 contrast requirements.  \n   • Visual chaos is present and decorative, as called out by the prompt (“aria-hidden” animations).  \n   • The swirling panels and arrows correctly illustrate the “dense web of code fragments” described.\n\n7. Minor Observations  \n   • In the prompt files, secondary text is specified as Cool Grey (#C6CBD4); in the mockup it’s rendered a little closer to pure white for maximum legibility, but still reads as a lighter gray against black.  \n   • There’s no explicit “The problem isn’t your tools” aria-hidden markup visible in the image itself—but that would live in the HTML layer, not the design.\n\nOverall, this image functions as the “Problem Space” section of the voder.ai pre-launch site: a dark canvas of colliding code fragments, overlaid by a bold statement about the gap between intent and implementation.

It reads like a slide or section of the site rather than an icon or logo. Here’s what I see:\n\nGeneral  \n• Background: Almost pure black—very deep navy with just a hint of purple at the bottom right. No obvious navigation or UI chrome, just a floating pair of panels.  \n• Typography: Crisp, modern sans-serif for body and UI copy; the headline (“Change the prompt. Not the team.”) is set in a larger, more elegant text face (akin to the Inter/Satoshi semi-bold called for in the spec). Secondary text is a muted cool-grey, primary text is paper-white.\n\nLeft panel  \n• Prompt snippet: a slightly translucent, rounded-corner rectangle labeled at the top in small grey text “Tone” and below it, in white, “Casual, confident, modern.” This matches the “prompt appears” state in Section 6 of the spec—but there the right-hand UI copy was supposed to read “Let’s get you started!”, not “Begin your journey.”  \n• Headline: immediately underneath the snippet, in large white type—“Change the prompt. Not the team.” This text exactly matches the spec for Section 7 (“Change the prompt. Not the team.”).  \n• Subtext: beneath the headline, in cool grey, “With Voder, your intent drives product delivery. No briefs. No handoffs. No misaiignment.” Note the word “misaiignment” is misspelled here (an extra “i”); the prompt files spell it “misalignment.”  \n• No live “code diff” or dynamic animation frames are visible—just a static mock-up.\n\nRight panel  \n• A floating card with equally dark background and rounded corners.  \n• Large white copy: “Begin your journey.”  \n• A single rectangular button beneath, labeled “Get Started.”  \n• In the spec there is explicitly no primary call-to-action button or Get Started link—instead the closing moment ends with “Coming soon.” So this diverges by adding an interactive element that the pre-launch spec said to exclude.\n\nColor & contrast  \n• Text on dark background all meets (or exceeds) the AAA ratios from the brand guide (white on black, grey on black).  \n• Accent teal or green glow—called out heavily in the brand palette—is absent here; the panels are uniformly charcoal-grey.\n\nLayout  \n• Two-column horizontal layout, left column is roughly twice the width of the right.  \n• Generous spacing around each element, large line-height on headlines, comfortable margins.\n\nWhat doesn’t match the prompt files  \n1. The right-hand text reads “Begin your journey.” and offers a “Get Started” button—neither of which appear in any of the narrative sections (no CTAs are allowed).  \n2. The primary “Let’s get you started!” text from the spec’s Section 6 never appears.  \n3. The spelling error “misaiignment” vs. “misalignment.”  \n4. There is no indication of dynamic or scroll‐tied animation, ARIA labels, or reduced-motion support in this static image—whereas the spec is very explicit about live updates (`aria-live=\"polite\"`), motion-sensitivity, and semantic HTML.  \n5. The spec calls for a prompt update example (“Tone: Premium, minimalist.”) to show the code UI morphing; this image remains stuck on the first prompt (“Casual, confident, modern.”).\n\nIn sum, this looks like a quick visual mock-up of the transition from prompt edit to benefit-driven messaging, but it omits several of the interactive, accessibility, and copy details laid out in the Voder prompt files—and even introduces a CTA that the spec expressly forbids.",

There are no overt graphics or 3D objects—just a gently curved, soft-light gradient hinting at depth.  \n• Centered, large white text (high-contrast at roughly AAA levels) set over the dark field. The main headline reads:  \n  “We believe software  \n   should start with intent.”  \n  Below it, in a smaller weight and point size, sits the supporting copy:  \n  “Not code, Not files, Not frameworks.  \n   But the spark behind them all.”  \n• No visible navigation, buttons, or scroll hints—reinforcing that this frame is about intrigue and establishing intent rather than prompting action.  \n\nHow it aligns with the spec  \n- Content and hierarchy match the “The Why” section exactly—core belief headline plus the two-line support text.  \n- Color contrast is correct (Paper White on Deep Navy/black).  \n- Tone is minimalist and calm—no superfluous graphics or UI chrome.  \n\nWhere it diverges or is simplified  \n- Typography here looks like a classic serif or semi-serif, whereas the guide prescribes Inter/Satoshi (modern sans) in semi-bold.  \n- The spec calls for a typing animation on the headline and subtle particle or abstract morphing behind it; this still frame is static and shows only a smooth gradient.  \n- Punctuation in the supporting line uses commas between “Not code, Not files, Not frameworks,” whereas the prompt text uses periods.  \n- Accessibility elements (skip links, live-region markup, ARIA labels) are, of course, not visible in the image, so we can’t confirm their presence.  \n\nOverall, this looks like a faithful static mockup of the “We believe…” section—just without the live typing effect, particle field, or explicit ARIA/HTML scaffolding that would exist in the running site.",

    "description": "The image is a full-screen, vertically oriented “flow diagram” on a very dark background (near-black, roughly Voder Black #0A0A0A). Everything is centered along one vertical axis. There are four main text nodes, each separated by a single, narrow glowing bar:\n\n1. At the very top you see the heading “Source Prompts” in a large, off-white, geometric sans-serif (the same style used throughout). Directly beneath it, in a smaller, cool-grey tone, is the sub-line “Intent lives in markdown prompts.”\n\n2. Below that is a thin vertical line. The line glows softly in a pale teal-blue hue (intended to be the Soft Teal Glow accent), fading out at its ends.\n\n3. The next node is the word “Voder” in the same large off-white type, followed by a smaller grey sub-line: “Voder interprets and compiles your vision.” \n\n4. A second glowing teal line appears under that, matching the first.\n\n5. The third node reads “Application Code” as the heading, with the subtext “Code is written, structured. and versioned — for real” in that same cool-grey. (Note: there is a small typo or unexpected line break—“structured.” ends the first line and “and versioned — for real” wraps below.)\n\n6. A third glowing line divides that from the last node.\n\n7. At the bottom is “Working Product” in the large off-white type, with no further subtext.\n\nVisually, this matches the “Vision Flow” section of the spec exactly—showing a linear progression from Source Prompts → Voder → Application Code → Working Product. The choice of colors (off-white text on black, pale grey subtext, and teal glow accents) aligns with the brand guide’s palette. The typography, spacing, and minimalist presentation all fit the high-contrast, AAA-compliant requirements. \n\nOne very minor discrepancy: the subheading under “Application Code” flows onto a second line in a slightly awkward way (“structured. and versioned…”), which may just be an artifact of viewport width rather than design intent. Otherwise, the image adheres to the prompt files’ description of the conceptual flow diagram with no significant deviations.",

    "description": "This image reads like the opening “hero” panel of the Voder pre-launch site—part logo reveal, part conceptual illustration, part headline. Here’s what you’d understand from it without seeing it:\n\n1. Overall Layout & Purpose  \n   • Full-screen, dark-mode background (almost pure black) establishes a cinematic, premium feel.  \n   • At the very top-center sits the brand name “Voder” in large, crisp white letters—this serves as the logo or wordmark.  \n   • In the middle floats a 3D cube: translucent, softly glowing, with gently undulating internal highlights that suggest data or energy flowing. It feels decorative but also symbolic (recalling the “prompt cube” mentioned in the brand entry spec).  \n   • At the bottom-center is the main headline or “hook”:  \n     “What if your prompts  \n      were the source?”  \n     set in white, clear sans-serif text, broken across two lines for emphasis.\n\n2. Colors & Contrast  \n   • Background: Voder Black (#0A0A0A) or something extremely close—supports AAA contrast with white text.  \n   • Logo & Headline Text: Paper White (#FFFFFF), meeting WCAG AAA contrast against the black.  \n   • Cube Accent: The glowing veins inside the cube read more icy-blue or silvery rather than the brand’s official Soft Teal Glow (#24D1D5). It still lives in the cool-tone family, but it isn’t the exact teal-green accent specified in the palette.\n\n3. Typography & Styling  \n   • “Voder” appears set in a geometric, semi-bold modern sans-serif (consistent with Inter/Satoshi guidelines for headlines).  \n   • The question below is in a lighter weight of the same (or very similar) font, sized for body text but with generous spacing—again matching the minimalist, premium tone.  \n   • No other UI chrome (navigation, buttons, forms) is present—just brand, cube, headline.\n\n4. Alignment with the Prompt Files  \n   • This panel combines elements from “Section 1: Brand Entry” (3D object, black background, white logo, no navigation) and the suggested “Hero Line” (“What if your prompts were the source?”) from the brand guide.  \n   • It lacks any on-screen loading indicators, skip-link, or aria attributes that would appear in the actual HTML, but visually it nails the intended mood and structure.  \n   • The cube is a suitable stand-in for the “prompt cube” mentioned in the assets, though the glow color diverges slightly from the specified Soft Teal.  \n   • The image does not yet include the official tagline “The Compiler for Prompts” in the closing or footer position—presumably that appears in a later scene.\n\n5. Where It Doesn’t Match Exactly  \n   • Accent color: The cube’s internal glow skews toward icy-white/blue instead of the brand’s defined #24D1D5.  \n   • Missing aria- and focus-related elements (e.g. skip link) obviously aren’t shown in this pure visual.  \n   • The spec calls for an initial 3–4 second animation sequence (dissolve, particle drift, etc.) before showing the headline—here we see only the final still frame.\n\nIn short, this image is the stately hero frame for Voder.ai: a nearly black canvas, the white “Voder” wordmark above a subtly animated-looking cube, and the headline question “What if your prompts were the source?” below. It captures the minimalist, cinematic, high-trust tone described in the prompt files, with only a slight color-accent shift from the brand palette.",

    "description": "This image reads like a hero-style teaser for the Voder brand—a dark, almost pitch-black canvas with three key elements stacked vertically and center-aligned:\n\n1. Top: The word “Voder” in large, crisp white sans-serif lettering (think Inter/Satoshi style).  \n2. Middle: A semi-transparent, softly illuminated 3D cube. Its faces ripple with gentle, fluid light trails in a cool blue-teal hue. It looks more like a glowing block of liquid crystal than a hard-edged cube—minimalist, mysterious, alive.  \n3. Bottom: In smaller white text, the question  \n   “What if your prompts  \n    were the source?”  \n   split onto two lines, maintaining generous spacing and centered under the cube.\n\nColors & Mood  \n– Background: Very dark navy-black (almost pure black), giving a premium, cinematic feel.  \n– Accent glow: Subtle blue-green highlights within the cube, suggesting energy or data flowing inside.  \n– Text: Pure white, high contrast against the background for maximum legibility and that “quiet confidence” tone.\n\nLayout & Purpose  \n– Feels like a static mock-up of a homepage hero or pre-launch splash screen.  \n– The floating cube likely stands in for the “prompt cube” mentioned in the spec’s Brand Entry section.  \n– The headline “What if your prompts were the source?” isn’t in the provided prompt files (which prescribe taglines like “The Compiler for Prompts” or “We believe software should start with intent”). That makes this image a creative variation rather than a direct match.\n\nHow it diverges from spec  \n– Tagline: The spec’s opening and closing moments call for “The Compiler for Prompts” or statements about intent, not a question about prompts as the source.  \n– Accessibility/UI cues: There are no visible landmarks for navigation, skip links, or ARIA hints—this looks like a flat marketing mock rather than an annotated, accessible section.  \n– Animation hints: In the spec, the cube would be orbiting or breathing with scroll-tied GSAP transitions; here it’s shown statically.\n\nIn sum, you’re looking at a lean, premium-feeling brand teaser: a dark backdrop, a softly glowing 3D cube as the centerpiece, the Voder wordmark above, and a provocative question below that frames the high-concept promise of “prompts as source.” It captures the mood of the pre-launch site but swaps in a different headline than the official spec.",
