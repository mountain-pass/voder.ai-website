    "description": "This image appears to be the very first view of the Voder pre-launch site—the “brand entry” or hero frame that sets the mood for what follows. Here’s what’s on screen:\n\n• Background & Overall Feel  \n  – A deep, near-black canvas (the “Voder Black” surface) fills the screen, giving a sense of infinite space.  \n  – The lighting is subtle and cinematic, with just enough detail to suggest depth without revealing any distracting textures.  \n\n• Logo / Title  \n  – Centered near the top is the word “Voder” in crisp, white letters.  \n  – The typeface is clean and geometric, evoking the modern sans-serif headlines defined in the brand guide.  \n\n• 3D Cube Illustration  \n  – Below the logo floats a gently rounded cube, its edges soft rather than sharp.  \n  – The cube’s faces are translucent with a muted teal-blue glow dancing beneath the surface—thin sinuous lines that pulse and flow, as if energy is circulating inside.  \n  – Highlights and reflections on the cube’s top and side faces add dimensionality, while the interior strands of light create an almost living, breathing quality.  \n\n• Tagline / Caption  \n  – Under the floating cube, in the same white text, sits the question:  \n      “What if your prompts were the source?”  \n  – This line uses generous letter-spacing and balanced margins to align with the site’s minimalist, premium tone.  \n\n• Purpose & Tone  \n  – There are no navigation menus, forms, or calls to action—just a quiet invitation to scroll further.  \n  – The effect is one of calm confidence and intrigue, hinting at a system that can turn simple “prompts” into meaningful structure.  \n  – Together, the black-field layout, glowing teal accents, and terse copy function as a high-trust, cinematic introduction—exactly the kind of teaser experience the prompt files describe for Voder’s brand entry.",

No photographs or icons—only text, all in white, set in a modern geometric sans-serif.\n\n• At the very top-center sits a single word, “Voder,” in large, bold letters.  \n• Below that, centered and in a smaller weight, is the brand’s signature line: “The Compiler for Prompts.”  \n• A little further down comes a quiet promise, “Coming soon.”  \n• And at the bottom-center, resting just above that teal glow, is a whisper-small attribution: “Built with Voder.”\n\nEverything is vertically stacked with generous spacing around each line, reinforcing a minimalist, premium feel. There are no buttons, nav links, or other UI elements—this is purely a brand stamp and a final sign-off, designed to leave the viewer with a sense of calm confidence and anticipation.",

    "description": "This image presents a single, softly glowing 3-dimensional cube suspended against an almost pitch-black field. There is no text or other elements—just the cube and its dark backdrop. Here’s what you’d notice if you couldn’t see it directly:\n\n• Shape & Form  \n  – A geometric cube with gently rounded edges and corners, so that it reads as both precise and organic rather than harsh or mechanical.  \n  – Its six faces are semi-transparent, giving the impression of frosted glass or a very thin membrane.\n\n• Internal Detail & Lighting  \n  – Beneath the translucent surfaces you can just make out a network of flowing, wave-like ribbons of light. These strands trace smooth, curving paths from one face to another.  \n  – The glow is a cool teal-blue—bright enough to be clearly visible on the dark background, but never garish or high-contrast, more like a quiet pulse of energy.  \n  – Wherever those internal ribbons touch the “walls” of the cube, the surface itself brightens in a small soft bloom, drawing your eye to the fluid motion inside.\n\n• Surface & Material  \n  – The outer faces are subtly reflective: you can see very faint highlights along their top and side edges, as if a distant light source is grazing the form.  \n  – There is no specular “shiny” gloss—these reflections are muted, contributing to the premium, almost jewel-like quality of the shape.\n\n• Background & Mood  \n  – The background is an uninterrupted near-black. It frames the cube in a void, giving the object the feeling of floating in space.  \n  – There are no gradients, patterns, or other distractions—just the negative space that emphasizes the cube’s quiet presence.\n\n• Purpose & Use  \n  – It reads like a brand-entry illustration or an advanced “favicon”-style icon: abstract enough to suggest mystery and conceptual depth, yet concrete enough to feel like a standalone logo symbol.  \n  – Its minimalist composure and kinetic interior imply a system that’s intelligent, adaptive, and energy-driven—perfect for introducing a product whose core promise is “turning prompts into structure.”  \n\nIn short, this is not a literal photograph or diagram, but a polished 3D emblem—its glowing interior and muted, translucent shell working together to evoke a sense of calm confidence, premium design, and latent motion.",

    "description": "This image is a full-screen “metaphor” slide—part of Voder’s narrative journey—set against a near-pitch-black backdrop. Everything is rendered in shades of white and light gray to maximize contrast and maintain a minimalist, cinematic feel.\n\nLayout & Structure  \n• At the very top, centered, is a large headline in a crisp, serif-inspired typeface:  \n  “You’ve been in the passenger seat.”  \n  It reads like a statement of fact, inviting reflection.  \n\n• Below that sits a simple, flowing line diagram. A thin, curved path connects four evenly spaced nodes:  \n  – The first node, labeled “Idea,” is a solid white circle—bright and prominent.  \n  – The second node, “Design,” is a slightly dimmer circle in light gray.  \n  – The third node, “Code,” is another pale gray dot further along the curve.  \n  – The final node, “Ship,” is a faint circle at the far right.  \n  A smooth, single-stroke line weaves through these points, suggesting forward momentum from conception to delivery.\n\n• Farther down, two lines of body copy in a clear, modern sans-serif appear:  \n  “Tools like Copilot and Cursor help you steer… but you’re still  \n   stuck giving directions.”  \n  This text sits in medium-weight white, split onto two lines for readability, and softly fades into view.\n\n• Beneath that is a closing question in a slightly heavier weight:  \n  “What if your system already knew the destination?”  \n  This line is brighter and bolder, serving as the rhetorical pivot toward Voder’s promise.\n\nColor & Contrast  \n• Background: pure Voder Black (essentially #000)  \n• Headline and body text: Paper White (#FFFFFF) for maximum legibility (19.6:1 contrast)  \n• Diagram line and dots: light gray tones (≈ Cool Grey #C6CBD4) to distinguish them from text without overpowering  \n• No other hues—keeps the focus on the narrative and ensures WCAG-compliant contrast.\n\nPurpose & Tone  \nThis slide conveys the core metaphor (passenger vs. navigator). It highlights how existing tools still leave you “giving directions,” then teases the idea of a tool that already “knows the destination.” There are no interactive controls visible here—just a cinematic, scroll-triggered snapshot meant to emotionally frame Voder as more than an autocomplete or code helper.\n\nARIA & Accessibility Notes (as per spec)  \n• Background illustration treated as decorative; critical text is plain HTML  \n• Headline is a semantic h1 (or h2 depending on hierarchy)  \n• Body copy uses paragraph tags with sufficient line spacing  \n• Motion tied to scroll, with `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback disabling any animated path drawing  \n\nIn essence, this visual is a distilled journey line: Idea → Design → Code → Ship, overlaid with crisp copy, all designed to make the viewer feel like they’ve been relegated to the passenger seat—and to set up Voder as the vehicle that will finally let them take the driver’s position.",

    "description": "This frame is the “Outcome Focus” slide in the Voder teaser—essentially a benefits overview laid over a deep, near-black canvas. Here’s what you’d see:\n\n• Background & Mood  \n  – A very dark backdrop (almost pure black) with just a whisper of texture or vignette at the edges to keep it from feeling flat.  \n  – No busy patterns—everything is about contrast between light copy and dark ground.\n\n• Benefit Lines (Bullet List)  \n  – Four concise value statements, each introduced by a familiar emoji icon rather than a heavy graphic. From top to bottom you get:  \n    1. A small rocket (🚀) followed by “Deliver faster without losing control”  \n    2. A target symbol (🎯) and “Align product, brand, and tech from day one”  \n    3. A light-bulb icon (💡) and “Iterate on ideas, not implementations”  \n    4. A circular arrow (🔄) and “Make fewer handoffs. Create fewer misunderstandings.”  \n  – Each line is set in a clean white sans-serif with generous spacing—enough room that your eye easily jumps from icon to text without feeling crowded.\n\n• Anchor Headline  \n  – Below the bullet list sits the big, bold payoff line in oversized type:  \n      “Outcomes, not overhead.”  \n  – This is the focal point—large, white, and centered horizontally, giving a sense of calm confidence.\n\n• Supporting Subtext  \n  – Directly beneath that headline is a smaller, lighter-weight line of copy:  \n      “Voder bridges the gap between strategy and shipping—without adding layers, delays, or drift.”  \n  – It’s set in the same white tone but with reduced size and weight, serving as a clarifying tagline.\n\n• Typography & Color  \n  – All text is pure white (Paper White on Voder Black) for maximum contrast and legibility.  \n  – The font feels modern and geometric (in keeping with the brand’s Inter/Satoshi styling).  \n  – The emoji icons add a spark of color (red, yellow, teal, etc.) but are used sparingly—subtle accents rather than screaming blue or green.\n\n• Layout & Purpose  \n  – Vertically stacked, center-aligned content that reads like a Persuasive List → Pillar Statement → Elaboration.  \n  – No navigation or controls—this screen exists purely to crystallize “what you get” by using Voder (speed, alignment, iteration, simplicity).  \n  – It’s the narrative bridge from the “prompt-driven demo” into the final brand stamp.\n\nOverall, it’s a minimalist, high-contrast benefits summary that uses simple icons and bold copy to reinforce the idea that Voder is about delivering real outcomes—no extra overhead.",

Immediately beneath it, a secondary heading in a slightly lighter white/grey:  \n     “It’s the gap between your ideas and your implementation.”\n\n  3. Below that, a descriptive paragraph in mid-weight cool-grey text:  \n     “Developers stitch together frameworks, boilerplate, and brittle glue code — all to approximate what you actually meant.”\n\nSurrounding this central text are faint, decorative representations of code fragments and UI elements, all rendered in translucent white outlines and text. You can make out little “windows” labeled things like “webpack.config.js” or bits of pseudo-code such as “var App.esx import path…”. Hand-drawn style arrows thread between these fragments, and on the right you see two tiny boxes labeled “UI” and “REST API” with arrows connecting them.  \n\nNothing in the background is meant to be read in detail—these ghosted panels and lines simply evoke the sense of chaos and fragmentation that developers face when stitching together disparate tools and files. The pure white and cool-grey text stands in stark contrast to the dark field, driving home the message that the real obstacle isn’t any single tool but the gap between intent and implementation.",

Top-left “prompt” panel  \n   • A small, softly rounded rectangle, barely lighter than the background.  \n   • In the upper corner a grey label reads “Tone,” and below it, in bright white text, “Casual, confident, modern.”  \n   • It evokes the idea of a prompt editor or input card—what you feed into Voder.\n\n2. Center-left headline panel  \n   • Below (and slightly in front of) the prompt card sits the primary message area.  \n   • A giant, high-contrast headline in a modern serif reads:  \n       “Change the prompt.  \n        Not the team.”  \n   • Beneath that, in mid-weight cool grey, is a two-line pitch:  \n       “With Voder, your intent drives product delivery.  \n        No briefs. No handoffs. No misalignment.”  \n   • The text sits in generous white space, its crisp letters floating as if on a stage.\n\n3. Right-side UI card  \n   • Another softly rounded rectangle, slightly larger, containing a mini “product” or “landing” panel.  \n   • A bold statement in white sans-serif declares: “Begin your journey.”  \n   • Below it is a single, pill-shaped button edge-outlined in muted grey with white text: “Get Started.”  \n   • This panel dramatizes the result of changing the prompt—an instant UI transformation.\n\nAcross all three elements, corners are rounded, outlines are subtle, and all text is either pure white or cool-grey against the nearly black backdrop. There are no additional graphics, icons or navigation chrome—just these floating cards. The overall effect is a quiet, cinematic tease of how Voder can reconfigure a UI simply by tweaking a single text prompt.",

    "description": "This looks like a single, softly rounded, translucent cube rendered in 3D. There is no text or graphic overlay—just the cube itself, centered on what appears to be a pure-white (or very light) background. Here’s what stands out:\n\n• Form & Material  \n  – The cube’s edges are slightly chamfered (rounded), giving it a gentle, almost organic silhouette rather than a hard, mechanical one.  \n  – Its surface is semi-transparent, as though carved from frosted glass or a high-tech resin.  \n  – Inside the cube you can just make out sweeping, wavy patterns—thin “ribbon” or “wave” lines that catch light and glow with a very pale blue. Those internal lines give the object a sense of internal flow or energy.  \n\n• Lighting & Color  \n  – The overall tint of the cube is almost pure white, but the internal waves glow a whisper-soft cyan-blue.  \n  – Subtle highlights on the faces and edges suggest a single, diffuse light source overhead or slightly front-left.  \n  – Because the background is completely white, the cube casts almost no visible shadow—its form “floats” in the space.  \n\n• Purpose & Context  \n  – There are no UI elements or text captions, so this image reads like a product asset or placeholder model (for example, the `cube.glb` placeholder mentioned in the project’s mockups).  \n  – In the pre-launch spec the brand entry is meant to be on a deep black background with a teal glow; here the image is on white with a very pale blue glow, so it doesn’t match the “Voder Black” + “Soft Teal Glow” aesthetic described in the prompt files.  \n\nIn short: it’s a clean, minimal 3D cube illustration—likely a raw placeholder 3D model—shown in isolation on white, rather than in the dark, cinematic setting the final site sections require.",

The cube itself appears semi-transparent, with softly rounded edges and faces that catch a cool teal light. Across its surfaces are undulating, ribbon-like streaks of glowing teal that suggest energy or data flowing through the form. Where two faces meet, the light pools briefly into a small, bright highlight, then drifts away in faint filaments. There is no text, iconography or branding superimposed on the cube—it’s simply the sculptural object, centered in the frame with generous “breathing” space around it.\n\nPossible purpose  \n• A decorative 3D placeholder or hero graphic, likely used in the “Brand Entry” or opening scene of the site to suggest technology, fluidity, and premium feel.  \n• Serves as a non-literal, abstract object rather than a functional control or logo lock-up.\n\nColors & Contrast  \n• Background: nearly black (Voder Black #0A0A0A or deeper)  \n• Cube edges/faces: deep navy/charcoal with subtle reflectance  \n• Accent streaks: Soft Teal Glow (#24D1D5) with variable intensity, always high contrast against the dark surfaces\n\nLayout & Composition  \n• Centered 3D object, no surrounding UI chrome or text  \n• Ample negative space—nothing distracts from the cube  \n• No visible floor or environment; the cube seems suspended in ambient void\n\nRelation to the Specification  \n• Matches the role of a placeholder 3D model (the prompt files mention using `cube.glb` in the Brand Entry section).  \n• Differs from the scripted “orbiting 3D object” described for the intro—this is a static render rather than an animated or particle-driven scene.  \n• No typography or taglines overlaid here, even though many sections specify accompanying text; this appears to be purely the 3D asset itself.\n\nIn short, this image is a standalone, conceptual 3D cube rendered with glowing teal streaks on dark surfaces—ideal as a hero or background object but not a finished hero section (since it lacks overlaid headlines, logos or interaction cues).",
