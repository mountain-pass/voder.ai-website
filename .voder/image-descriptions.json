    "description": "This is a mock-up or landing-page hero section for a web-based tool called “voder.” It’s laid out as a full-width, dark-mode interface against a starry-space background, with the blue-tinted curve of a planet (or horizon) peeking up from the bottom of the screen.\n\n1. Branding and Header  \n • Centered at the very top is the voder logo: a small, three-dimensional hexagon split diagonally into a glossy dark side and a glowing green side, followed by the brand name in lowercase white typewriter-style text (“voder”).  \n • Beneath the logo is the main headline in large, white sans-serif text: “The Compiler for Prompts.”  \n • Directly under that is a sub-headline in slightly smaller, light-gray text: “Now it’s time to version our prompts.”\n\n2. Prompt-creation Input Area  \n • In the middle of the page sits a wide, rounded-corner input box styled like a search bar or code editor. Its background is pitch black, with subtle outlining.  \n • At the very top-left corner of this box is faint placeholder text that reads “Start to create.”  \n • Inside the box on the left are two pill-shaped buttons:  \n   – “Vibe” (blue background with a magnifying-glass icon)  \n   – “Code” (dark background with a tiny “x” icon)  \n • On the right side of this input area are four small, monochrome icons laid out horizontally: a gear (settings), a globe (language or models), a paperclip (attach), and a blue microphone (voice input).\n\n3. Navigation Pills  \n • Below the input area are five evenly spaced pill-style navigation buttons (dark rounded rectangles with white or light-blue text/icons):  \n   – About (rocket icon + “About”)  \n   – Philosophy (globe icon + “Philosophy”)  \n   – Media (heart icon + “Media”)  \n   – Research (magnifier icon + “Research”)  \n   – Founders (network or nodes icon + “Founders”)\n\n4. Additional Details  \n • The overall color palette is deep navy blues, black, and charcoal, punctuated by crisp white text and occasional electric-blue or neon-green accents.  \n • Tiny, twinkling stars of various sizes dot the background, giving a sense of depth and space.  \n • In the bottom-right corner of the viewport floats a small circular help button (blue circle with a white question-mark), suggesting live chat or documentation access.  \n\nPurpose and Feel  \nThis layout feels like the opening screen of a next-generation prompt-engineering or AI-assistant platform—positioned as “the compiler” where users can write, version, and refine their prompts in a structured environment. Its clean, futuristic design and space motif convey an exploratory, tech-savvy brand personality.",

    "description": "The image is a stylized mock-up of what appears to be a dark-mode web-app or landing-page interface for a product called “voder.” It’s laid out in a single, vertically stacked column, centered on a deep navy-blue background that fades into black toward the top and shows the curved lit edge of the Earth along the bottom. Small pinpoints of light and larger four-point “star” flares are scattered across the backdrop, reinforcing a subtle space-oriented aesthetic.\n\n1. Logo and Brand Name  \n   – At the very top, centered, there’s a small geometric icon: a three-dimensional hexagon split between a deep black on the left face and a glowing green gradient on the right face.  \n   – Directly to the right of that hexagon is the brand name “voder” in all-lowercase, set in a simple, monospaced white font.\n\n2. Headline and Subhead  \n   – Beneath the logo, in large white text, is the main headline:  \n     “The Compiler for Prompts.”  \n   – Under that, in a slightly smaller medium-gray text, is a subhead:  \n     “Now it’s time to version our prompts.”\n\n3. Central Input/Command Bar  \n   – Centered below the headlines is a long, rounded-corner rectangle with a pitch-black fill and a thin gray outline. This is the primary input or command bar.  \n   – Inside the leftmost area of this bar is a light-gray placeholder text reading “Start to create.”  \n   – Directly below that placeholder (but still within the left half of the bar) are two pill-style buttons:  \n     • A blue button labeled “Vibe” with a small magnifying-glass icon.  \n     • A dark-gray button labeled “Code” with a small “</>” icon.  \n   – Along the right portion of the bar are four small icons spaced horizontally:  \n     1. A settings-gear icon  \n     2. A globe icon (suggesting language or region)  \n     3. A paperclip or attachment icon  \n     4. A circular blue microphone button\n\n4. Secondary Navigation Pills  \n   – Just below the input bar, there is a row of five evenly spaced, dark pill-shaped buttons (black or very dark gray) each with a small colored icon on the left and a label in white text:  \n     • “About” (rocket icon in light blue)  \n     • “Philosophy” (globe icon in purple)  \n     • “Media” (heart icon in purple-pink)  \n     • “Research” (magnifying-glass icon in pale blue)  \n     • “Founders” (network/web icon in pale purple)\n\n5. Background and Atmosphere  \n   – The entire scene is overlaid on a night-sky depiction: miniature stars and nebula-style pinpoints of light, with a quarter-curved horizon of Earth (lit in midnight-blue tones) occupying the lower third of the viewport.  \n   – Subtle lens-flare effects and starbursts add to the outer-space vibe.\n\n6. Help/Support Button  \n   – In the very bottom right corner of the viewport is a floating circular button in a bright royal blue, containing a white question-mark icon. This visually signals a help or support function.\n\nOverall Purpose and Feel  \n– The layout, typography, and iconography suggest this is a landing page or main interface for a developer-or designer-oriented tool that lets users “compile” or version their text prompts (likely in the context of AI or design workflows).  \n– The use of dark backgrounds with bright accent blues and greens, combined with space imagery, evokes the feeling of high tech, exploration, and precision.  \n– Rounded rectangles, pill-shaped controls, and minimalist icons give the design a modern, clean, and approachable look.",
