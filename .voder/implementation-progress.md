## Next Actions

‚ö†Ô∏è **MINOR CLEANUP REQUIRED BEFORE NEW STORY DEVELOPMENT**

No blocking issues identified, but uncommitted changes need to be addressed. All current stories are complete and production-ready.

**Required cleanup steps:**
1. **Commit assessment changes**: Commit the updated traceability files and implementation-progress.md
2. **Review three-animation changes**: Evaluate and commit or discard changes to src/three-animation.ts and tests/three-animation.test.ts
3. **Handle generate_traceability.sh**: Decide whether to commit or ignore the new untracked script

**After cleanup:**
1. Begin next story development with confidence in solid foundation
2. Continue leveraging established quality processes and analytics insights
3. Monitor Microsoft Clarity dashboard for user behavior insights to inform future development priorities
