Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 54.2

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (85.625% ± 9% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The project is in a strong state: the site builds, unit tests run and coverage tooling is configured, linting/formatting is enforced, and security automation is in place. The primary blocker is test reliability: Playwright end-to-end runs and CI e2e stability are not yet consistently producing measurable test artifacts and coverage, which lowers overall confidence in automated verification. Addressing the CI verification step and ensuring Playwright artifacts and health checks are robust will raise the overall project readiness.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Add a non-interactive CI verification step immediately after run-e2e.sh that validates e2e-stability.json (stats.total>0 OR non-empty artifacts), dumps preview.out on failure, and exits non-zero to mark preview/startup failures distinctly from test failures.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The repository implements a small static pre-launch website with clear main entry points, a working build, and a passing test suite. Core functionality (rendering the site, init logic, build and unit tests) is implemented and verified. Minor gaps: end-to-end/playwright tests were not executed against a running server, and I could not retrieve recent git commit history from the environment (git log failed), which reduces confidence slightly.
- Main entry points present: src/main.ts (boots the app) and src/app.ts (init function that renders into #app).
- index.html includes the module script /src/main.ts and a #app container (so the page will render the content injected by init()).
- Unit tests exist and run successfully: npm test output shows 4 test files, 14 tests passed. (Tests: tests/prepare-libraries.test.ts, tests/health-check-utils.test.ts, tests/main.test.ts, tests/coverage-increase.test.ts).
- Build works: npm run build produced a Vite production build (Vite reported built artifacts and files like dist/index.html and asset files).
- Health-check utilities and scripts are present and covered by tests (scripts/health-check-utils.js has parseVersion, compareSemver, checkLockfileAndNodeModules and tests exercise them).
- E2E test exists (tests/e2e/app.spec.ts using Playwright) which verifies page title and visibility of #app, but I did not run Playwright e2e against a running server in this assessment.
- No server-side API or CLI detected/required — this is a static site. package.json scripts include dev, build, preview, test, and other tooling commands.
- Node engine requirement is declared (node >= 22.17.0) and the runtime used in the environment is v22.17.1.
- Could not read recent git commit history due to git log failing in this environment (commands returned errors), though git status shows some tracked changes in .voder/ files. This limited inspection of recent commit metadata.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the dev server and smoke-test the site in a browser: npm run dev (default http://localhost:5173). Verify the page renders as expected and interactive/visual pieces behave correctly.
- Execute Playwright e2e tests against a running server (or use npm run e2e:ci with a server started) to validate end-to-end behavior: start the preview or dev server and run npx playwright test.
- Add/verify a CI job that runs build + unit tests + Playwright e2e (start server, run e2e, stop server) to ensure end-to-end functionality in CI.
- If commit history / recent commits are important for functionality audits, fix the git environment or run git log locally to review recent changes (the current environment produced errors when running git log).
- If you expect an API or CLI, add tests and integration checks for them. If not, consider documenting that this repository is a static website in the README (already partly done) and include a smoke-test checklist for releases.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Overall code quality is strong for the size of the project: there's a well-configured linting/formatting toolchain (ESLint, Prettier, stylelint, htmlhint), TypeScript type-checking, passing tests, and a successful production build. The codebase is small and well-organized, so many CODE_QUALITY concerns are already addressed. Remaining opportunities are about tightening rules, expanding test coverage, and formalizing some runtime error/log handling and CI enforcement.
- Linting/config: eslint.config.ts at repo root and a full ESLint flat config under config/eslint (base.ts, dx.ts, performance.ts, index.ts). The ESLint config uses @typescript-eslint parser, import resolver, simple-import-sort and unicorn plugin (installed in package.json).
- Prettier: prettier.config.ts exists and running `npm run format:check` reported: "All matched files use Prettier code style!"
- Stylelint: stylelint.config.ts present with reasonable rules (alphabetical property ordering, common best-practice rules). `npm run lint:css` runs stylelint (no errors emitted during run).
- HTML linting: htmlhint run (`npm run lint:html`) scanned index.html and reported no errors.
- ESLint run: `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:check` executed (no output/errors), indicating code passes configured ESLint rules in this repo state.
- Type checking: `npm run type-check` (tsc --noEmit) executed successfully (no errors).
- Tests: Vitest test suite ran (`npm test`) — 14 tests passed (4 test files). Tests exercise src/init behavior (tests/main.test.ts) and other utilities.
- Build: `npm run build` completed successfully and produced a small production bundle under dist/.
- Project scripts: package.json includes a comprehensive set of scripts for linting, formatting, testing, type-checking, build, verify, and security/audit-related tasks.
- Code organization: src/ is small and focused (src/app.ts, src/main.ts, src/style.css). The app initialization logic is isolated in app.ts making it testable; naming is consistent and descriptive (init, main).
- Error handling: app.ts has basic defensive handling (checks for #app element and logs an error + early return) — simple but present.
- Code duplication/complexity: not applicable/low — the codebase is very small, so no meaningful duplication or complexity was observed.
- Conventions: consistent use of TypeScript, module style (ESM), and CSS variables; tsconfig includes sensible paths and test types.

**Next Steps:**
- Enforce lint/format/type-check/test steps in CI (if not already): ensure `verify` or equivalent runs on PRs and fails builds on lint/type/test failures.
- Tighten ESLint rules where appropriate for long-term maintenance (e.g., consider enabling '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any' and stricter no-console rules for non-test scripts) and document exceptions in an ADR or README.
- Add coverage thresholds to vitest config or CI to guard against regressions in test coverage (project already has tests; increase coverage on src code paths).
- Introduce lint-staged + husky pre-commit hooks to prevent bad formatting/lint issues from being committed (there is a .husky directory but ensure hooks are configured to run format/lint checks).
- Expand runtime error handling and logging strategy: replace ad-hoc console.* calls with a small logging wrapper if the app grows, and add tests around error paths.
- Add static analysis scans (optional) such as dependency vulnerability scanning in CI, and consider tools for duplicate-code detection if the codebase grows.
- If the project grows, add stricter performance/security-focused ESLint layers or rules (performance.ts is present as a layer placeholder — consider enabling rules when needed).

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (70% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- The project has a solid test setup: Vitest unit tests run and pass locally with coverage enabled (100% for the files measured). Playwright e2e tests are present but appear to be run separately in CI and are failing there. Coverage is configured but currently only measures a small surface (app/main). CI e2e instability reduces overall testing reliability.
- Test files exist: multiple Vitest unit tests under tests/ (coverage-increase.test.ts, health-check-utils.test.ts, main.test.ts, prepare-libraries.test.ts) and an e2e Playwright spec tests/e2e/app.spec.ts.
- Testing frameworks configured: vitest (scripts: test, test:watch, test:coverage) and Playwright (playwright.config.ts and e2e script e2e:ci in package.json).
- Local test run (npm test) completed successfully: 4 test files, 14 tests — all passed.
- Coverage run (npm run test:coverage) completed successfully and reported 100% coverage for the files measured (app.ts, main.ts). Vitest is configured to use v8 provider and output json/html/text.
- Vitest config excludes e2e tests from unit runs (tests/e2e/**) and excludes many config/build files from coverage; coverage therefore currently covers a small targeted set (app.ts and main.ts shown).
- Playwright e2e tests exist and expect a running site (playwright.config.ts baseURL=http://127.0.0.1:5173). The project provides npm scripts to preview and to run e2e:ci but e2e are not executed as part of the vitest suite.
- GitHub Actions status shows repeated failures for .github/workflows/e2e-stability.yml (recent runs marked as failure), indicating CI pipeline instability / failing e2e in remote runs even though local unit tests pass.
- Some source files under src/ are excluded by repository ignore patterns in this environment, but tests import them and the local test run succeeded, confirming the tests execute in this environment.

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate the failing GitHub Actions e2e workflow: inspect the Action run logs for the failing .github/workflows/e2e-stability.yml to determine if failures are due to the preview server not starting, network/timeouts, or flaky tests.
- Reproduce e2e locally: start the preview server (npm run preview or npm run build && npm run preview) then run npx playwright test (or npm run e2e:ci) to reproduce failures and capture artifacts (screenshots, traces).
- Ensure CI starts the static server before running Playwright tests (e.g., use npm run preview in background or use the Playwright 'webServer' option) so tests run against a reachable baseURL (127.0.0.1:5173).
- Broaden coverage: add unit/integration tests for more of src/ to avoid the current limited coverage surface. Consider removing overly broad excludes in vitest coverage config or explicitly include key modules.
- Stabilize flaky e2e tests: add retries (already set in config for CI), add better waiting/guards in tests, collect traces/screenshots on failure, and add explicit health checks that the app is ready before assertions.
- Add CI reporting for test coverage and fail the pipeline intentionally when coverage drops below a target, so coverage regressions are caught early.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (92% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- Execution is strong: the project builds, unit tests pass with 100% coverage, and the production preview server serves built assets and the app's HTML/JS. A small number of environment-related command timeouts were observed when running some npm scripts synchronously in this analysis environment, and end-to-end/playwright tests were not executed here.
- Build: npm run build completed successfully (vite built production assets into dist; dist/index.html and dist/assets/*.js and .css were produced).
- Preview server: npm run preview was started successfully in the background and served index.html and the built JS/CSS at http://localhost:4173/ (curl returned index.html and assets).
- Unit tests: npm test (vitest) ran and all test files passed: 4 test files, 14 tests, 14 passed.
- Coverage: npm run test:coverage produced a v8 coverage report showing 100% coverage for the project files (app.ts and main.ts and 'All files' at 100%).
- Runtime behaviour: The built JS renders the app content into #app; source shows a defensive check in src/app.ts that logs an error if the #app element is missing and returns (basic runtime error handling present).
- Dependencies & engines: package.json declares runtime dependencies (@microsoft/clarity, gsap, three) and enforces Node >=22.17.0 (which is restrictive but explicit).
- Command execution quirks: Running npm run dev/preview synchronously via the environment's run_command sometimes produced ETIMEDOUT errors; starting the preview via the background server helper succeeded. This appears to be an environment/runner limitation rather than a project failure.
- Project is small and minimal — functionality is simple and testable; no runtime exceptions were observed in the served JS and tests.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the project's e2e Playwright tests (npm run e2e:ci) in an environment with Playwright browsers installed to validate end-to-end behaviour and detect runtime issues not covered by unit tests.
- Add or verify CI job(s) to run: install, build, lint, unit tests (with coverage), and the Playwright suite where CI supports browsers — ensure CI uses Node >=22.17 as declared or relax the engine requirement if broader compatibility is desired.
- Investigate and document why synchronous execution of long-running npm scripts timed out in this analysis environment (may be an environment limitation); ensure maintainers can run dev/preview locally and in CI reliably (consider adding health-checks/logging).
- Improve runtime observability: add structured logging and error-reporting hooks (Sentry/other) and more robust handling for unexpected runtime states beyond the current guard for missing #app.
- Expand tests to include integration/e2e checks that exercise the actual DOM in a headless browser and any interactive/animation behaviour provided by dependencies (three/gsap), to increase confidence in runtime stability.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Overall documentation is strong for a small static site: there is a clear README with setup/usage, developer setup guide, architectural decision records (ADRs), per-library notes, security guidance and audit tooling. Missing/weak areas are API documentation (none provided), a changelog/release notes, a CONTRIBUTING guide, and some empty docs files. Code comments/docstrings are minimal but the codebase is small and tests + scripts are documented and runnable.
- README.md exists and contains clear quick-start instructions (install via `npm ci`, `npm run dev`, build, preview, tests, lint/format commands).
- Developer instructions: docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md provides an explicit, step-by-step local verification sequence (type-check, lint, format, build, tests) and troubleshooting notes.
- Architectural documentation: docs/decisions/ contains many accepted ADRs (0000..0024) describing design decisions and rationale.
- Dependency / library documentation: docs/libraries/ includes per-dependency/technology notes (e.g. vite.md, typescript.md, vitest.md, etc.).
- Security & audit docs: SECURITY.md describes triage guidance and scheduled scans; .github/scripts/parse-audit.js is present and documented; audit-summary.md and ci-audit-summary.md exist.
- Scripts and CI mapping: package.json contains a comprehensive scripts section (dev, build, test, verify, docs:setup, docs:report, security:local etc.) which matches README guidance.
- Tests run successfully in this environment: `npm test` completed and all tests passed (4 test files, 14 tests passed). This indicates docs about test commands are accurate.
- Some docs files are empty or sparse: docs/E2E-REPRO.md and docs/CI-AUDIT.md are empty, reducing discoverability for e2e reproduction and CI audit specifics.
- No API documentation found: there are no API.md or docs describing any programmatic API surface (search for 'API' and any API doc files returned none).
- No changelog or release notes found (no CHANGELOG* files).
- No CONTRIBUTING.md or CONTRIBUTING guide detected to help new contributors with process/PR/branching conventions.
- Code comments/docstrings are minimal: src contains brief comments (e.g., single-line comments in src/app.ts and src/main.ts) but no JSDoc-style docstrings or in-depth inline documentation. For a small project this is acceptable but could be improved for richer libraries or APIs.
- Docs appear generally consistent with code/scripts (package.json scripts mentioned in README and docs correspond to actual scripts).

**Next Steps:**
- Add a changelog or release notes (CHANGELOG.md) and establish a release process (link in README).
- Create a CONTRIBUTING.md covering PR process, code review expectations, branching, and how to run the verification sequence locally.
- If the project exposes any programmatic or HTTP API surface, add dedicated API docs (API.md or docs/api/) or generate OpenAPI/typedoc as appropriate.
- Populate or remove empty docs (docs/E2E-REPRO.md, docs/CI-AUDIT.md) to avoid confusion; add short pointers in README to the most important docs.
- Improve inline documentation for code: add JSDoc comments or short docstrings for exported functions (e.g., src/init) to help future contributors and enable autogenerated docs if desired.
- Consider adding a short 'How to release' section in docs or README that references CHANGELOG and CI release workflow, and add a link to ADR index in README for discoverability.
- Add a CONTRIBUTING checklist or template for new contributors and optionally CODE_OF_CONDUCT to help community contributions.
- Add a small docs-health check in CI (e.g., ensure markdownlint and docs:report run) to keep documentation up to date.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are well-declared and actively audited: package.json lists runtime and dev deps, a package-lock.json is present, npm audit reports no vulnerabilities, npm ls shows a resolved dependency tree, and Dependabot + a CI security-audit workflow are configured. The main limitation is inability to programmatically produce an outdated-dependencies report and to inspect the lockfile contents within this environment.
- package.json exists and declares runtime dependencies (@microsoft/clarity, gsap, three) and a comprehensive set of devDependencies (eslint, vitest, vite, typescript, etc.).
- package-lock.json exists in the repository (presence verified), providing reproducible installs; its file contents are excluded from automated read access here.
- npm audit --json was executed and returned zero vulnerabilities (auditReportVersion: 2; metadata.vulnerabilities total: 0). audit.json and ci-audit.json in the repo also show no vulnerabilities.
- npm ls --json --long ran successfully and shows installed dependencies resolved with versions and no extraneous top-level modules; runtime deps three@0.180.0, gsap@3.13.0, @microsoft/clarity@1.0.0 are present.
- .github/dependabot.yml is configured to check npm weekly and .github/workflows/security-audit.yml runs npm audit in CI and archives artifacts — good automation for dependency updates and security scanning.
- package.json enforces Node engine >=22.17.0 and the execution environment used here ran Node v22.17.1 (satisfies engine constraint).
- There are existing audit artifacts (audit.json, audit-summary.md, ci-audit.json, ci-audit-summary.md) indicating audits are run and tracked.
- Attempted 'npm outdated' (and 'npm outdated --json') failed in this environment, so an automated list of outdated packages could not be produced here.

**Next Steps:**
- Run 'npm outdated --json' locally or in CI with network access to get a current list of outdated dependencies and evaluate upgrade impact.
- Ensure package-lock.json is reviewed in commits and that CI uses 'npm ci' for reproducible installs; inspect the lockfile locally to confirm versions and transitive dependency hygiene.
- Continue running npm audit in CI (already configured) and triage any future findings; consider setting a cadence for reviewing Dependabot PRs.
- Consider trimming unused devDependencies to reduce maintenance surface area and install footprint.
- If specific runtime dependencies are critical, consider stricter pinning or documented upgrade policies and add dependency-change checks in the release checklist.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Strong security automation posture with daily npm-audit, gitleaks secret scan, and CodeQL workflows plus local audit artifacts showing no vulnerabilities. Repository includes pre-commit checks, Dependabot config and audit/secret scan scripts. Areas for improvement: missing lockfile (package-lock.json not present in repo snapshot), production sourcemap exposure risk, and a few CI / branch-protection hardening items.
- Security automation workflows present: .github/workflows/security-audit.yml (npm audit + SBOM), .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml (gitleaks), and .github/workflows/code-scanning.yml (CodeQL).
- Local audit artifacts present and show no active vulnerabilities: audit.json (metadata.vulnerabilities all zero) and audit-summary.md reporting 0 high/critical issues.
- Secret-scan artifacts exist (repo-secrets-scan.txt and repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt) but are empty in the repo snapshot; the workflow will upload artifacts and fail when secrets are detected.
- A custom audit parser is included (.github/scripts/parse-audit.js) and is used in the security-audit workflow to fail the run if high/critical advisories are found.
- Pre-commit hooks (.husky/pre-commit) enforce format/lint/type-check locally to reduce introducing problematic code.
- Dependabot configured (.github/dependabot.yml) to open weekly dependency updates (helps keep deps current).
- Package.json contains security-related scripts (audit:fix, security:local) and a verify script that runs audit fix + lint + build + tests.
- No obvious hardcoded secrets were found by repository scan of files included in this checkout (grep-like search returned no matches for common secret keywords).
- No package-lock.json was found in the repository snapshot (npm ci in CI expects a lockfile). Absence of a lockfile reduces reproducible installs and may allow unintended dependency selection.
- vite.config.ts sets build.sourcemap: true — producing sourcemaps for production builds can leak source code if artifacts are published; review publishing of sourcemaps.
- This is a static front-end site (no server-side auth code present), so many runtime auth concerns do not apply; however, there are no explicit HTTP security headers, CSP configuration, or SRI in the HTML.
- CI references a secret (VITE_SENTRY_DSN) in actions (ci.yml) — using GitHub Actions secrets is appropriate but ensure least privilege and rotation policies are in place.

**Next Steps:**
- Add and commit a package-lock.json (or other lockfile) so npm ci in CI is reproducible and audits are deterministic. Ensure Dependabot and CI use the lockfile for security updates.
- Disable or avoid publishing production sourcemaps (set sourcemap: false for production builds) or ensure they are never uploaded to public hosting/artifacts.
- Enforce branch protection rules and require the security workflows (audit, secret-scan, CodeQL) and CI verify job to pass before merging. Require PR reviews for dependencies updates.
- Enable/verify Dependabot security updates and GitHub Dependabot alerts are active for this repository (Dependabot config exists; confirm organization settings).
- Harden GitHub Actions: ensure workflows use least-privilege permissions, avoid passing secrets to untrusted third-party actions where possible, and pin actions to specific versions/commit SHAs if required by policy.
- Add a Content-Security-Policy (CSP) and consider Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external resources to reduce XSS risks on the site.
- Continue to run and review artifacts from security-audit, secret-scan, and CodeQL runs; triage and remediate any new high/critical findings promptly.
- Document incident/secret handling and rotation steps in SECURITY.md (it already contains triage guidance; expand to include contact & response procedures).
- Consider adding automated checks for accidental sourcemap/credential/artifact publication in CI (e.g., prevent publishing artifacts that match *.map to public buckets).
- Regularly rotate and audit any GitHub Actions secrets (e.g., VITE_SENTRY_DSN) and ensure they are scoped appropriately.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (85% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- Version control is well-structured and actively used: clean branching model, clear conventional commit messages, CI integration, tags and remotes present, and pre-commit hooks configured. Minor issues: a small uncommitted state (two modified files), a couple of repository housekeeping items (no .gitattributes, no LICENSE file), and an inconsistency where some .voder files are tracked yet excluded from tooling's view.
- Current branch: fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage (git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD).
- Working directory has modifications: .voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md are shown as modified (git status output showed M .voder/history.md and M .voder/last-action.md).
- Commit history shows consistent, descriptive commit messages using conventional commit-style prefixes (examples from recent log: 'ci(e2e): fix lint warnings in generator', 'ci(workflow): include e2e-stability.txt...', 'docs: add E2E reproduction guide').
- Recent activity and branches: several long-lived branches exist (main, several cleanup branches) and recent commits are present — repository is actively maintained (git branch output, recent log entries).
- Tags exist: v1.0.0-complete and v1.0.1 (git tag --list).
- Remote origin is configured: https://github.com/mountain-pass/voder.ai-website.git (git remote -v).
- .gitignore is present and comprehensive (node_modules, build outputs, env files, logs, coverage, etc.).
- Pre-commit hooks are configured with Husky (.husky/pre-commit runs format:check, lint:check, type-check). core.hooksPath is set to .husky/_ (git config).
- CI workflows exist (.github/workflows/ci.yml) with robust verify / artifact upload steps and e2e orchestration — good integration between version control and CI.
- Some files are tracked that may be unexpected or cause confusion: preview.out is tracked (git ls-files confirmed) and .voder files are modified but read_file attempts were blocked by .voderignore (tooling read_file reports the .voder files are excluded by .gitignore/.voderignore while git still shows them modified). This indicates an ignore/tracking mismatch for .voder files.
- No .gitattributes file found in the repository (no matching files returned by search) — could help with consistent line endings and export settings.
- No LICENSE file found (search returned none). package.json shows "license": "UNLICENSED".
- Commit author for many recent commits is 'voder-bot' (git log output and git config user.name/email show voder-bot), indicating automation/bot activity which is fine but worth noting for attribution/auditability.

**Next Steps:**
- Resolve the small uncommitted state: either commit the intended changes to .voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md, or stash/clean them before preparing releases (git add && git commit, or git stash).
- Resolve the .voder tracked/ignored mismatch: decide whether .voder/* should be tracked. If they are ephemeral, stop tracking them (git rm --cached .voder/*) and add them to .gitignore/.voderignore; if they must be tracked, ensure tooling does not treat them as ignored so automation can read them.
- Add a .gitattributes file to enforce consistent line endings and other attributes (e.g., '* text=auto') to avoid platform-specific diffs.
- If the project is intended for public reuse, add an explicit LICENSE file (choose appropriate license) rather than leaving package.json as UNLICENSED.
- Consider adding commit-message linting (commitlint) to enforce the conventional commit style automatically if desired, and/or enable signed commits for additional auditability.
- Ensure pre-commit hooks and CI are documented in CONTRIBUTING.md or README so contributors know how to skip or run checks locally (SKIP_HOOKS helper is present but document usage).
- Before releases/merges to main, ensure working directory is clean and that any generated or ephemeral files (like preview.out, unless intentionally tracked) are handled consistently to avoid accidental commits.
