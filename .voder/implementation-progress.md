## Phase 6: Runtime Validation - ❌ FAILED

### E2E Test Execution Results:

**Total E2E Tests**: 460
**Passed**: 371 (80.7%)
**Failed**: 54 (11.7%)
**Skipped**: 35 (7.6%)
**Duration**: 6.9 minutes
**Test Framework**: Playwright

### Critical Failure Categories:

**1. Accessibility Failures (8 tests)**:
- Semantic HTML structure validation failing across all browsers
- Issue: Missing proper semantic HTML elements (header, main, footer, nav, section, article)

**2. Layout/Positioning Failures (30+ tests)**:
- Narrative height validation (80vh requirement) failing on mobile, tablet, desktop
- Narrative content positioning (10vh margins) failing
- Flex layout validation failing
- Responsive breakpoint integrity failing
- Problem P003 (Button overlapping 3D cube) failing across browsers

**3. Scroll-Locked Reveal Failures (4 tests - webkit/Mobile Safari)**:
- Initial hide validation failing (opacity 0.5 vs expected <= 0.1)
- Progressive reveal validation failing (opacity 0.5 vs expected <= 0.2)

**4. FOUC Prevention Failure (1 test - chromium)**:
- Visual flicker detection during page load

**5. Screenshot Validation Failures (4 tests)**:
- Business Area screenshot validation failing on desktop-landscape

**6. Performance Validation Failures (1 test - Mobile Chrome)**:
- 3D cube performance mode improvement validation failing

**7. Scroll Narrative Detection Failures (3 tests)**:
- Viewport detection logging issues
- Cross-viewport consistency failing

**8. Mobile 3D Cube Resize Failure (1 test - chromium)**:
- Cube size jump prevention on mobile scroll failing

### Performance Warnings (Non-Blocking):
- 3D Animation disabled due to poor FPS in test environment (11-13 FPS vs 15 threshold)
- This is expected in headless/CI environments and doesn't represent production issues

### Phase 6 Assessment Result:

**❌ FAILED - BLOCKING** - 54 E2E test failures across multiple critical areas

**Assessment Decision**: **STOP ASSESSMENT** and proceed directly to Phase 11 (Report Generation) per fail-fast instructions

**Blocking Issues**:
1. **Semantic HTML Structure**: Critical accessibility requirement not met
2. **Layout Validation**: Narrative content height/positioning requirements failing
3. **Problem P003**: Known problem (button overlap) still occurring in tests
4. **Scroll-Locked Reveal**: Story 026.02 acceptance criteria not met
5. **Responsive Design**: Breakpoint integrity failing across devices
