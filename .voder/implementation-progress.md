# Implementation Progress Assessment

**Generated:** 2025-09-10T18:56:06.414Z

![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (80.63% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The codebase is well-structured with strong tooling, linting, and dependency practices; builds and unit tests run reliably and ADRs/documentation capture design choices. The primary deficiency is testing: Playwright E2E stability and CI orchestration are currently unreliable and cause the overall verification pipeline to fall below required thresholds. Addressing E2E flakiness, preview orchestration, and a few documentation gaps will raise the project to completion.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Stabilize Playwright E2E: fix preview orchestration, add a fast health-check, capture richer diagnostics (traces/videos), and ensure CI uploads artifacts so tests become reliable and meet coverage/flakiness thresholds.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Functional static pre-launch website with working entry points, passing unit tests, and a successful production build. No backend or CLI to validate; e2e tests are present but were not executed in this assessment.
- Main entry points found: src/main.ts (bootstraps app) and src/app.ts (exports init()).
- App behavior: init() injects HTML into #app; tests confirm the Voder heading and 'Coming soon...' text are rendered.
- Unit tests: npm test (Vitest) ran successfully — 4 test files, 14 tests passed.
- Build: npm run build completed successfully with Vite, producing dist/ assets (index.html, JS, CSS).
- Index.html correctly references /src/main.ts as the module entry point and includes meta/SEO tags.
- Health and utility scripts implemented and unit-tested (scripts/health-check-utils.js).
- No server/API endpoints or CLI entry points were found — project is a static frontend. Playwright/e2e config exists but e2e tests were not run here.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the dev server (npm run dev) and manually verify UI, animations, and any 3D content in a browser.
- Execute end-to-end tests (npx playwright test or npm run e2e:ci) against a running preview (npm run preview) to validate runtime behavior.
- Add CI steps to run build, unit tests, and e2e tests on PRs to catch regressions early.
- If backend or CLI functionality is intended, implement smoke endpoints/commands and add corresponding automated tests.
- Expand tests to include accessibility checks (axe) and visual/regression tests for interactive or animated elements.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The project demonstrates a strong, modern code-quality setup: ESLint (flat config), Prettier, Stylelint, htmlhint and markdownlint are configured, a comprehensive test suite (Vitest) runs and reports 100% coverage for the app files, and formatting/linting scripts exist and are used. A few minor style/lint warnings were present initially (fixable), but overall code organization, naming, and test coverage are excellent for the repo size.
- ESLint is configured using a flat config entry point (eslint.config.ts) and a rich set of rule layers under config/eslint (base, dx, performance). package.json exposes lint, lint:fix and lint:check scripts.
- Running `npm run lint` produced 6 warnings (padding-line-between-statements) in .github/scripts/generate-e2e-stability-summary.js — no errors. `eslint . --fix` was run and fixed fixable issues.
- Prettier is configured (prettier.config.ts) and running `npm run format:check` initially flagged style issues in .github/scripts/generate-e2e-stability-summary.js; `npm run format` (prettier --write) was run and fixed them.
- Tests (Vitest) run successfully: `npm test` passes all tests. `npm run test:coverage` reports 100% coverage for app.ts and main.ts (and All files 100% for the small codebase).
- Code organization is clear and consistent: src contains app.ts, main.ts, style.css; tests exist in tests/ and a config/ directory holds extensive tooling configs. package.json defines many helpful scripts (verify, health-check, prepare, etc.).
- Naming and module resolution are consistent with ESM + TypeScript patterns: tests and runtime import ../src/app.js while source is app.ts (intentional pattern when using ESM + TypeScript bundling).
- Error handling is minimal but adequate for this small static site (init() checks for the #app element and logs an error).
- Additional linters are configured: stylelint (stylelint.config.ts), htmlhint (htmlhint.config.js), markdownlint (.markdownlint.json) and corresponding npm scripts exist for CSS/HTML/MD linting.
- No obvious code duplication in the small codebase. The repository includes CI workflow files and a 'verify' script that chains audit, lint, format and tests for a strict quality gate.

**Next Steps:**
- Ensure CI runs `npm run verify` (or equivalent) and that `lint:check` and `format:check` pass in CI. Currently local runs showed fixable warnings which should be eliminated so lint:check succeeds without requiring lint:fix.
- Consider adding lint-staged + Husky pre-commit hook to prevent style/lint regressions before commit (there is a .husky folder but no lint-staged enforcement observed).
- Expand unit/e2e tests coverage for additional runtime code if the project grows beyond the current minimal app (the current 100% coverage is for a very small codebase).
- Add a CI badge or documentation note showing that lint/format/tests are enforced in CI to make the quality gate explicit to contributors.
- Periodically run dependency audits (npm audit) and keep devDependencies aligned; a script exists (security:local) — consider adding automated dependency-scan step to CI.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (40% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Unit tests are present and pass locally with full coverage for core app entry points, but end-to-end (Playwright) tests are not runnable as-is and the repository's e2e CI workflow is repeatedly failing. Overall test reliability and CI E2E coverage are currently inadequate, so testing cannot be considered fully healthy.
- Unit tests exist in tests/*.ts (main.test.ts, health-check-utils.test.ts, prepare-libraries.test.ts, coverage-increase.test.ts) and a tests/setup.ts for test setup.
- Project uses Vitest for unit tests (package.json scripts: test, test:coverage, test:ci) and has vitest.config.ts configured to use jsdom and a coverage provider (v8).
- Running npm run test locally: vitest ran 4 test files, 14 tests total — all passed (output: 4 passed, 14 passed).
- Running npm run test:coverage locally produced a coverage report showing 100% statements/branches/functions/lines for app.ts and main.ts.
- Playwright is configured for e2e tests (tests/e2e/app.spec.ts and playwright.config.ts) and there is an e2e:ci script in package.json.
- Attempting to run Playwright e2e locally (npm run e2e:ci and npx playwright test ...) failed (commands returned errors and did not produce test results in this environment).
- GitHub Actions e2e workflow (.github workflow e2e-stability.yml) shows repeated failures in the last runs (inspected CI pipeline status).
- Vitest configuration explicitly excludes tests/e2e/**, so e2e tests are not run with the unit test suite — they must be executed separately and depend on environment (web server, browsers).
- Coverage is high but only for a couple of small entry files (app.ts and main.ts); many scripts and other code (scripts/, config/) are excluded from coverage per vitest config.
- Because CI e2e workflows are failing and local e2e execution did not succeed, the test suite as a whole is not fully reliable; per assessment rules, failing tests in CI force a reduced score regardless of unit coverage.

**Next Steps:**
- Diagnose and fix Playwright e2e failures: reproduce locally by starting a dev/preview server (e.g. npm run dev or npm run preview) before running npx playwright test, or configure Playwright's webServer option to start the site automatically.
- Ensure Playwright browsers are installed in local/CI environments (run npx playwright install in CI before tests).
- Update CI workflow to start a preview server (or use Playwright webServer) and to run npx playwright test; capture and upload Playwright logs/artifacts to debug failing runs.
- If e2e tests are flaky in CI, add retries and better isolation (start with single browser project or increase timeout), and preserve traces/screenshots/videos for failures (playwright.config already configured for this).
- Expand unit/integration coverage beyond app.ts/main.ts to cover more modules and scripts (especially code in scripts/ and other logic not currently measured).
- Consider integrating e2e runs into the project's verify/test:ci flow (or provide a dedicated e2e:ci step that reliably starts the server and installs Playwright browsers) so CI reflects real end-to-end test status.
- Add CI assertions that surface test failures clearly (failing the job on test failures) and add notifications or badge updates to track test health over time.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (90% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- The project builds and runs successfully, tests pass, and a development server serves the app. Minor execution friction observed (preview command timed out in this environment). Overall execution quality is high for a small static site.
- npm run build completed successfully (vite built dist/ with assets).
- npm test (Vitest) ran and all tests passed: 4 test files, 14 tests — 14 passed.
- A Vite dev server (npm run dev) was started and responded to HTTP requests on port 3000; index.html and compiled /src/main.ts were retrievable via curl.
- Source entry points are simple and well-structured: src/main.ts initializes the app and src/app.ts contains init() which safely handles missing #app element (logs error and returns).
- Tests explicitly cover execution behavior (DOMContentLoaded handling, app rendering, and error logging when #app is missing).
- Runtime dependencies are declared in package.json (three, gsap, @microsoft/clarity).
- A preview command (npm run preview) failed here with spawnSync ETIMEDOUT; the failure appears environment-specific (spawn/timeout) rather than a build error—several vite preview/dev processes were observed in the environment during investigation.
- Health/maintenance scripts and utility functions exist and are unit-tested (scripts/health-check-utils.js covered by tests).
- Type checking and build step include tsc -p tsconfig.build.json, indicating type-checked production build pipeline.

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate & fix npm run preview timeout: try running vite preview directly (node_modules/.bin/vite preview) or increase spawn timeout in this environment to determine if failure is environmental or a script issue.
- Add a small smoke/integration e2e test (Playwright) that runs against the production preview to validate the preview server and built output end-to-end in CI.
- Capture server logs when running preview/dev to ensure no runtime warnings/errors are missed; integrate log checks into CI smoke tests.
- Document exact Node.js version + install steps for contributors (package.json has engines field but README could include an explicit nvm/asdf command).
- If not already done in CI, run the repository verify sequence (npm run verify) in CI to validate linting/format/build/test end-to-end and catch environment-specific issues early.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (72% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is generally good for developer onboarding and architectural decisions (README, developer setup guide, ADRs, library notes, SECURITY.md), but lacks API documentation, a changelog/release notes, inline docstrings/JSDoc, and there are a couple of incomplete/incorrect documentation automation bits (empty CI-AUDIT.md and a missing docs setup script referenced in package.json).
- README.md exists and contains clear quick-start instructions (install, run, build, test, lint/format) and troubleshooting notes — aligns with package.json scripts.
- docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md provides a thorough developer setup & verification guide (type-check, lint, format, build, tests) and reproduction steps for audit parsing.
- docs/decisions contains multiple Architectural Decision Records (0000..0024) — good architectural documentation and traceability.
- docs/libraries contains many per-library markdown files documenting choices/dependencies (e.g., vite.md, typescript.md, vitest.md, etc.).
- SECURITY.md present and contains automated triage guidance and references to CI workflows and artifacts.
- No CHANGELOG.md, RELEASES.md, HISTORY.md, or any conventional changelog/release notes file was found.
- No API documentation was found (no OpenAPI/Swagger, no API.md, no generated docs).
- Code contains only small inline comments; there are no JSDoc/TSDoc-style docstrings on public functions (e.g., src/app.ts and src/main.ts only have brief comments).
- docs/CI-AUDIT.md is present but empty (no content), indicating an incomplete doc file.
- package.json contains scripts docs:setup and docs:report which reference setup-package-docs.js, but that file was not found in the repository (missing automation referenced by docs scripts).

**Next Steps:**
- Add a changelog (CHANGELOG.md) or release notes and adopt a release process (e.g., keep changelog updated with each release or PR).
- If the project exposes APIs, add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger or a well-structured API.md) and examples; if not, add a short note in the README clarifying there is no public API.
- Populate or remove empty docs (e.g., fill docs/CI-AUDIT.md with intended content or remove to avoid confusion).
- Either add the referenced setup-package-docs.js or update package.json scripts to reflect the actual documentation tooling; ensure docs:setup/docs:report work locally/CI.
- Improve inline code documentation: add JSDoc/TSDoc comments to exported/public functions so generated API docs (if added later) are accurate and editor tooltips are helpful.
- Consider adding a CONTRIBUTING.md and a short RELEASE.md describing how to publish releases and how changelog entries should be authored.
- Add a small docs validation step to CI (e.g., run linting on docs, ensure docs build step/automation exits non-zero on missing pieces) to keep docs up to date with code changes.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are well-declared and managed: package.json lists prod and dev deps, a package-lock.json is present, npm CI installs reproducibly, and automated npm audit (local and CI artifact) shows no vulnerabilities. CI includes a daily security-audit workflow and an SBOM step. Minor improvements are recommended (regular outdated checks, remove unused/duplicated dev deps, confirm lockfile handling and automated upgrades).
- package.json present and parsed: project declares 3 production dependencies (@microsoft/clarity, gsap, three) and a comprehensive set of devDependencies (eslint, vitest, typescript, vite, playwright, etc.). (source: package.json)
- A package-lock.json exists in the repository root (exists check returned true). Some repository tooling hides the lockfile from file reads in this environment, but the lockfile is present per existence check.
- Local npm audit produced zero vulnerabilities (npm audit --json returned vulnerabilities: {}). audit.json, audit-summary.md and ci-audit.json in the repo also show 0 critical/high/moderate/low advisories.
- CI workflow present: .github/workflows/security-audit.yml runs npm ci, npm audit, produces audit.json and audit-summary.md, and attempts CycloneDX SBOM generation. parse-audit.js is included and fails CI on high/critical advisories.
- npm ci completed successfully in this environment (prepare script executed, packages linked/installed and 666 packages added), and npm ls --prod and --dev show the expected direct dependency versions installed (e.g., three@0.180.0, gsap@3.13.0, @microsoft/clarity@1.0.0).
- Audit metadata indicates a large dependency tree (metadata.total ~ 765–769 deps), with many dev dependencies — this increases surface area but is common for front-end projects with testing/linting toolchains.
- Commands to check for outdated packages (npm outdated --json and npm outdated --depth=0) failed in this environment; npx npm-check-updates returned no upgrade suggestions here. This means I couldn't produce a reliable outdated-deps snapshot from this run.
- The health-check script exists (scripts/health-check.js) and explicitly verifies presence of package-lock.json and node_modules, and runs type-check, lint and format checks — good for maintainability.

**Next Steps:**
- Run npm outdated (or npx npm-check-updates) in your development environment or CI to produce a comprehensive list of outdated dependencies and schedule upgrades for production dependencies first.
- Run a dependency-usage audit (e.g., depcheck, or manual import scan) to detect and remove unused dependencies, especially among the large devDependencies set to reduce maintenance surface.
- Consider pinning production dependency versions (or using an automated upgrade workflow) to reduce unexpected drift; continue to keep a committed lockfile (package-lock.json) to ensure reproducible installs.
- Enable/verify automated update bots (Dependabot/renovate). The repo already contains .github/dependabot.yml; ensure it's configured to open PRs for production deps and optionally auto-merge safe upgrades.
- Add/verify periodic SBOM generation and archive it with CI artifacts (security-audit.yml already attempts this); ensure the SBOM command is successful where needed.
- If CI or local environment sometimes fails to run npm outdated (as observed here), add a CI job that runs and uploads the outdated report or run npm-check-updates in CI to surface upgrade candidates.
- Periodically re-run npm audit in CI (already scheduled daily) and on PRs; treat any high/critical findings as blockers and open remediation PRs with minimal-impact fixes or dependency upgrades.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- The repository has a solid, automated security pipeline (npm audit, gitleaks secret-scan, CodeQL, SBOM generation, Dependabot). Current audit artifacts show zero reported vulnerabilities and there are no obvious hard-coded secrets in committed code. Remaining gaps are largely process/configuration and a few frontend best-practices (CSP, clear disclosure/contact in SECURITY.md) rather than critical technical vulnerabilities.
- Automated security workflows present: .github/workflows/security-audit.yml (npm audit + SBOM), .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml (gitleaks), .github/workflows/code-scanning.yml (CodeQL).
- Local/CI audit artifacts included: audit.json and audit-summary.md show 0 critical/high/moderate/low/info vulnerabilities (audit.json metadata reports total vulnerabilities = 0).
- Secret scanning artifacts files exist (repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt, repo-secrets-scan.txt) — the redacted file is present but contains no data in the checked-in tree.
- There is a parse-audit.js script (.github/scripts/parse-audit.js) used to summarize npm audit output; security:local and npm audit scripts exist in package.json.
- CodeQL is configured to run (languages: typescript, javascript) and upload SARIF output (.github/workflows/code-scanning.yml).
- Dependabot is configured (.github/dependabot.yml) to run weekly for npm dependencies.
- I searched the repository for common secret indicators and private-key markers and found no matches in committed files (grep returned no hits).
- There is no server-side code with authentication/authorization in the repository — this is a static frontend website (source under src/). As such there is limited attack surface from server-side auth issues in this repo.
- Missing or weak items: SECURITY.md is present but auto-generated and lacks a security contact/email and a coordinated disclosure process (no explicit reporting instructions or PGP/key).
- index.html contains no Content-Security-Policy meta tag or CSP headers configuration in the repo (no server config shown) — recommend adding CSP for frontend hardening.
- No explicit enforcement in the main CI pipeline to fail the overall build for new npm high/critical vulnerabilities (there is a daily security-audit workflow that fails on high/critical via parse-audit, but the CI workflow does not appear to block merges on audit failures).
- Some sensitive files (.env) are correctly in .gitignore, and CI uses repository secrets (example: VITE_SENTRY_DSN in .github/workflows/ci.yml).

**Next Steps:**
- Add a clear security/contact and coordinated disclosure section to SECURITY.md (email or third-party reporting form, PGP key or secure channel for reporters).
- Add a Content-Security-Policy (CSP) for the frontend (meta tag and/or hosting configuration) to reduce XSS risk and deploy CSP reporting in staging for tuning.
- Consider failing PR builds or blocking merges when the security-audit workflow detects new high/critical npm advisories (integrate audit check into main CI verify steps or add branch protection required status check).
- Ensure secret-scan artifacts are routinely reviewed and that the secret-scan workflow is configured to run on PRs and pushes (it is scheduled/daily — also ensure pre-merge scanning to prevent secrets entering history).
- Keep Dependabot/automated dependency updates enabled and consider automerging security-only updates after validation; also ensure lockfile is audited and reviewed before committing fixes (SECURITY.md already suggests reviewing lockfile diffs).
- Add SCA/SBOM consumption to release process (the security-audit workflow generates sbom.json — publish/attach SBOM to releases or internal registries).
- If the project will host on a custom server, ensure HTTPS/HSTS and secure headers are enforced at hosting level. Add deployment checks or infrastructure IaC scanning if applicable.
- If this repo later adds server-side code or APIs, add automated dynamic scanning, credential rotation policies, and ensure authentication/authorization tests are included.
- Document expected secrets handling in CONTRIBUTING/README (how to add secrets to GitHub Actions secrets, do not commit .env, how to rotate, etc.).
- Regularly review CodeQL and audit artifacts (SARIF and audit-summary) and create triage issues for any new high/critical findings; keep the parse-audit script and workflows up-to-date.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (88% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- Version control is well-established and active: a healthy commit history with clear messages, remote origin configured, CI workflows and important files tracked, and a comprehensive .gitignore. Minor issues: working directory is not clean (two modified .voder files), Husky hooks file exists but Git hooks are not present in .git/hooks (hooks may not be installed), and several large binary assets are tracked which may warrant Git LFS or review.
- git status (porcelain -b) shows current branch: fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage and two modified files: .voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md (uncommitted changes).
- Repository has an active recent commit history (example HEAD commits dated 2025-09-11) with concise, informative commit messages (many following conventional style and CI automation by 'voder-bot').
- Branches: local branch fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage is checked out and remote branches exist (origin/main and several cleanup branches).
- .gitignore exists and is comprehensive (ignores node_modules, build outputs, env files, logs, coverage, etc.).
- Important project files are tracked: package.json, package-lock.json, README.md, CI workflows (.github/workflows/*), tests, configs and source code are present in git.
- Husky hook file present at .husky/pre-commit with checks defined (format:check, lint:check, type-check), but .git/hooks/pre-commit does not exist — suggesting hooks are not installed into git's hooks directory yet.
- Remote origin is configured: https://github.com/mountain-pass/voder.ai-website.git (fetch & push).
- Large binary assets (font files, .glb models, many assets under assets/ and public/) are committed in the repository — this increases repo size and may be a maintenance concern.
- git ls-tree shows CI workflow files and scripts are tracked (e.g., .github/workflows/ci.yml, scripts/run-e2e.sh), which is good for reproducible CI.
- A small portion of the visible modifications are in .voder (project/assistant artifacts) which may be ephemeral and ideally excluded or cleaned up.

**Next Steps:**
- Clean or commit the uncommitted changes (.voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md). If they are ephemeral assistant artifacts, add an entry to .gitignore/.voderignore or remove them from the index to keep working directory clean.
- Install and enable Husky hooks locally so pre-commit hooks run for contributors: run npm ci and then npx husky install (or follow your Husky setup steps). Verify .git/hooks/pre-commit is created and the checks execute as expected.
- Consider Git LFS (or external storage) for large binary assets (fonts, .glb models) to keep repository size manageable, or review whether all committed binary assets are required in the repo.
- Add/verify repository governance: protect main branch, require PR reviews, enable required CI checks on GitHub (lint, tests, format), and consider commit signing or Conventional Commits enforcement if desired.
- Establish a lightweight changelog / release tagging practice (use annotated tags or CHANGELOG.md) so releases and important changes are discoverable in git history.
- Periodically run maintenance (git gc, prune) and monitor repository size/history growth if many large binaries remain tracked.
