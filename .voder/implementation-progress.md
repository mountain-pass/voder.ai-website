![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (44.12% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The repository implements a working Vite + TypeScript landing page with unit tests and many development-quality decisions captured in ADRs. However multiple required areas fall short of the project's thresholds: code quality (no automated scoring available), documentation is missing or incomplete, dependency verification and lockfile automation need finalization, and the test surface / coverage enforcement are incomplete. Security tooling and version control practices are in place but need hygiene (untracked audit artifacts). Prioritized remediation is required before marking the project complete.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Restore reproducible installs and dependency verification: commit and validate package-lock.json, run non-interactive npm ci + security:local, and address any high/critical advisories before proceeding.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (75% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- The project contains a clear main entry point and a minimal but working implementation of the landing page with a focused unit test that passes. Core client-side functionality (app initialization and DOM rendering) is implemented and covered by tests. There are no server/API endpoints or CLI features to validate, and broader integration/build verification and richer feature tests are missing.
- Project has a main entry point at src/main.ts which imports and initializes the app.
- App logic is implemented in src/app.ts with an exported init() function that renders content into a #app element.
- Static styles are present in src/style.css and used by the entry point.
- A unit test exists (tests/main.test.ts) that sets up a DOM, calls init(), and asserts the rendered content.
- Vitest was executed (npm test) and the single test passed: 1 test, 1 passed.
- package.json provides scripts for dev, build, preview, type-check and tests; dependencies and devDependencies are present and sensible for a Vite/TypeScript site.
- No server-side code, API endpoints, or CLI entry points were found to test/validate.
- No end-to-end/browser automation tests, accessibility checks, or build verification (build run) were executed as part of assessment; no CI status was evaluated here.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the build pipeline (npm run build) and verify the produced dist output to ensure production bundling works as expected.
- Add integration/E2E tests (e.g., Playwright, Cypress) to validate runtime behavior in browsers and across breakpoints.
- Add more unit tests to cover edge cases (missing #app handling is logged but could be tested) and additional components as features are added.
- Add CI configuration to run type-check, lint, build and tests on each push/PR to prevent regressions.
- If interactive or cinematic features are planned, implement and add tests for those (animations, 3D scenes, event handlers) and include performance and accessibility checks.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (0% ± 20% COMPLETE)
- Assessment failed due to error: Assessment was cancelled
- Error occurred during CODE_QUALITY assessment: Assessment was cancelled

**Next Steps:**
- Check assessment system configuration
- Verify project accessibility

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (50% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Basic unit testing exists and passes (Vitest + testing-library) but test surface is minimal. Coverage enforcement fails (90% global threshold) and running coverage produces Vite sourcemap errors and coverage threshold failures, so CI-style coverage runs are currently broken.
- Vitest is configured and present (vitest in devDependencies, vitest.config.ts exists).
- @testing-library/dom and @testing-library/jest-dom are installed and used (tests/setup.ts imports jest-dom).
- Test files found: tests/main.test.ts (contains a DOM unit test) and tests/setup.ts.
- Unit test run (npm test -> vitest run) succeeded: 1 test, 1 passed (tests/main.test.ts).
- Coverage run (npm run test:coverage) failed: Vite reported many missing source map files under config/dist/* and the coverage check failed against global thresholds.
- Reported coverage from test:coverage run: lines 0.47%, statements 0.47%, functions 86.66%, branches 85.24% while global threshold is 90% (causing failure).
- Vitest config references a createVitestJsdomConfig helper in config/testing/vitest-jsdom.js which is excluded by .gitignore/.voderignore in this workspace (hidden configuration may affect behavior).
- No integration or end-to-end tests were found; only a single small unit test exists, so most of the codebase is untested.
- No visible CI workflows or recent failing CI logs were found in the repository snapshot (.github exists but contains no visible workflows here).

**Next Steps:**
- Decide an immediate coverage policy: relax or remove the strict 90% global threshold to restore green CI while increasing tests, or keep the threshold and create a plan to reach it incrementally.
- Add unit tests covering core code paths (increase lines/statements coverage). Prioritize untested modules under src/ to raise overall coverage.
- Fix the Vite sourcemap errors surfaced during coverage runs (address missing map files under config/dist or configure Vite/Vitest to ignore those paths) so coverage runs complete cleanly.
- Introduce integration and/or end-to-end tests (Playwright, Cypress, or Vitest integration tests) to validate DOM lifecycle and module interactions beyond small unit tests.
- Make testing config explicit and available: include or build config/testing/vitest-jsdom.js (or adjust gitignore) so local and CI environments use identical testing configuration.
- Add a CI workflow that runs tests and coverage (with the chosen coverage policy) and publishes coverage reports/artifacts so regressions are visible and reproducible.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (78% ± 13% COMPLETE)
- The project builds cleanly and unit tests pass. The production build (vite) succeeded and produced a dist bundle. Running the preview/server in this environment timed out, and lint/type-check scripts were not executed here — likely environment/permissions limitations. Execution is solid for a small site, but there are a few gaps to verify in a normal runtime/CI environment and to harden runtime error handling and checks.
- npm run build completed successfully: vite built the site and produced dist/index.html and asset files (build finished in ~237ms).
- Unit tests ran and passed: vitest ran tests/main.test.ts (1 test) — all tests passed.
- Attempt to run the preview (npm run preview -> vite preview) failed in this environment with spawnSync /bin/sh ETIMEDOUT, so I could not verify the dev/preview server actually starts here.
- Type-check and lint commands did not run successfully in this environment (npm run type-check, npm run lint:check returned command failures here). Note: the build itself runs tsc -p tsconfig.build.json and that step succeeded as part of the build.
- Runtime dependencies are declared in package.json (@microsoft/clarity, gsap, three) but the small source code does not use them; verify whether they are required or can be removed to reduce surface area.
- Basic runtime error handling exists: src/app.ts checks for the #app container and logs an error (console.error) then returns instead of throwing.
- There are developer logs in the code: console.warn('Voder website starting...') and console.error('App element not found'). No build-time warnings were shown in the build output.
- Dist output is minimal and looks correct (index.html + small JS/CSS bundles); the app is intentionally simple (static DOM injection).

**Next Steps:**
- Run the preview locally (npm run preview) or in a CI runner with networking/port access to confirm the server starts and the built site serves correctly. Investigate the ETIMEDOUT in this environment if it persists.
- Run full lint and type-check locally or in CI (npm run lint:check, npm run type-check). Fix any lint/type errors and ensure 'verify' script runs cleanly in CI.
- Confirm runtime dependencies: audit code for use of @microsoft/clarity, gsap, and three. Remove unused dependencies or add usage and tests for them.
- Add a small integration/smoke test that starts a static server serving dist/ and verifies the page contains expected content (e.g., using Playwright or a simple http server + fetch), so preview/serve behavior is tested automatically in CI.
- Improve runtime error handling where relevant (e.g., robust initialization, fail-safe behaviors, and clearer logging).
- Add a CI workflow to run the full verify pipeline (lint, format check, type-check, build, tests, preview/smoke) so execution regressions are caught automatically.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (0% ± 20% COMPLETE)
- Assessment failed due to error: Assessment was cancelled
- Error occurred during DOCUMENTATION assessment: Assessment was cancelled

**Next Steps:**
- Check assessment system configuration
- Verify project accessibility

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (0% ± 20% COMPLETE)
- Assessment failed due to error: Assessment was cancelled
- Error occurred during DEPENDENCIES assessment: Assessment was cancelled

**Next Steps:**
- Check assessment system configuration
- Verify project accessibility

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (75% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Overall the project shows a reasonable security posture for a static pre-launch website: an npm audit artifact shows no current vulnerabilities and there are scripts to parse audit output and fail on high/critical advisories. There are some actionable concerns (production source maps enabled, no CSP/headers enforcement, and limited visibility into ignored files), so I score this as good with a few important improvements recommended.
- npm audit output present (audit.json) and indicates zero vulnerabilities. audit.json metadata.vulnerabilities: {"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":0,"high":0,"critical":0,"total":0}.
- Project includes a parse-audit script (.github/scripts/parse-audit.js) and a package.json script (security:local) that runs npm audit and parses the result; parse-audit.js exits non‑zero on high/critical advisories — good CI-ready behavior.
- No hardcoded secrets were found in the inspected files (package.json, vite.config.ts, index.html, src/*.ts, repo-secrets-scan.txt/redacted). repo-secrets-scan.txt and repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt are present but empty.
- Sourcemap generation is enabled in vite.config.ts (build.sourcemap: true). If source maps are published to production they may leak source code/comments and make discovery of secrets or implementation details easier.
- No Content-Security-Policy (CSP) meta tag or CSP/server header configuration found in the repository; index.html is minimal and there is no server config to enforce security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.).
- This is a static front-end site with no authentication/authorization code in the repo; therefore OWASP-style input validation/auth checks are not applicable, but any future backend or client-side form will need explicit validation and auth.
- Dev server configuration uses plain HTTP (vite server: port 3000) and no HTTPS/dev TLS configuration is present — fine for local development but ensure TLS is enforced in production hosting.
- Third‑party libraries are used (e.g., @microsoft/clarity, three, gsap). While current audit shows no advisories, these are additional trust/attack surface considerations (analytics libraries in particular may have privacy implications).
- Some files (e.g., package-lock.json) are present but were excluded from content reads by repository ignore settings in this assessment environment; that reduces the ability to fully verify lockfile contents and transitive dependency details.

**Next Steps:**
- Disable or avoid publishing production source maps. Set build.sourcemap to false for production builds (or generate source maps only in CI artifacts that are not published to production).
- Add strong security headers and a CSP. At minimum, add or recommend a Content-Security-Policy, HSTS, X-Frame-Options and Referrer-Policy on the hosting layer (and consider a CSP meta tag if no server controls).
- Integrate secret scanning and enforcement in CI (e.g., GitHub Actions with a secrets scanner). Re-run a repository-wide secrets scan including files ignored locally (and rotate any found secrets).
- Ensure npm audit is run in CI on every PR and fail the pipeline on high/critical advisories (the parse-audit script can be used; add a CI job invoking 'npm audit --json' and parse it).
- Commit and track the lockfile in source control (package-lock.json) if you want reproducible installs and easier auditing, or ensure the lockfile is scanned and audited in CI if it must remain out of VCS.
- Document production deployment security requirements (TLS enforcement, header configuration, CORS rules) and ensure the hosting/platform enforces HTTPS + HSTS and appropriate access controls.
- If/when adding server-side components or client forms, add explicit input validation, authentication and authorization checks, and automated tests for auth and input-handling.
- Periodically review third-party dependencies and remove/replace analytics or unused libraries if they increase privacy or maintenance risk; maintain a dependency update policy and schedule regular audits.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (75% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Version control is generally well-structured: clear, recent commit history with consistent, descriptive messages; lockfile and CI workflow tracked; a comprehensive .gitignore is present. However the working tree is not clean (multiple modified and many untracked files), a number of repo artifacts (audit outputs/docs) are left untracked or inconsistently handled, and a few hygiene items (bot identity, branch / PR processes) could be improved.
- git status shows a dirty working directory: multiple modified files (e.g. .github/scripts/parse-audit.js, scripts/health-check.js, src/main.ts, several .voder/* files) and many untracked files (audit.json, audit-postfix.json, docs/libraries/*.md, lint.json, repo-secrets-scan.txt).
- .gitignore is present and reasonably comprehensive (node_modules, dist, env files, caches, coverage, tmp, etc.), but some generated artifacts (audit.json, repo-secrets-scan.txt, docs/libraries/*) are intentionally/unintentionally untracked — SECURITY.md suggests audit.json should be kept off VCS unless safe.
- Commit history is active and well-formed: many recent commits (up to 2025-09-10) using conventional commit-style messages (feat/, fix/, chore/, docs/), good granularity and descriptive messages.
- Branches: main is current and remote-tracking remotes/origin/main exists. A few cleanup/* branches exist locally; no large proliferation of long-lived feature branches observed.
- Important files are tracked: package.json, package-lock.json, GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/security-audit.yml), and security/scripts (parse-audit.js) are in the repo.
- .voder files are tracked and currently modified. The tool could not display their contents due to local .voderignore behavior, but git shows them as modified — consider whether these should be tracked.
- Git history appears linear and well-maintained. There is evidence of automated bot commits (author voder-bot) and human commits (Tom Howard). The bot email in commits is voder-bot@example.com (placeholder) which may be undesirable for production audit trails.
- A security audit workflow exists which uploads audit.json and runs a parser; the project also keeps a redacted secrets scan file (repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt) tracked while the raw repo-secrets-scan.txt is currently untracked.
- No README.md file was found in the repository root via the tooling (README.md does not exist).

**Next Steps:**
- Clean the working tree: commit or stash the intended changes and either add appropriate files to .gitignore or commit generated artifacts intentionally. Keep the working directory clean before creating PRs or releases.
- Decide and document policy for audit and scan artifacts: add audit.json and other sensitive/generated outputs to .gitignore if they should never be committed; keep only redacted reports (as currently done) in VCS.
- Review tracked .voder/* files and determine if they belong in version control. If they are workspace/state artifacts, add them to .gitignore; if they are documentation, commit them consistently.
- Standardize bot commit identity: replace placeholder email (voder-bot@example.com) with an appropriate no-reply or team address to improve auditability, or document bot authoring in CONTRIBUTING/OPS docs.
- Enforce branch protection and a PR-based workflow for main (if not in place). Consider adding CI status checks that block merges until tests/lint/verify pass.
- Add a root README.md and contributing guidelines (if missing) so repository intent and processes (how to run audits, expected git hygiene) are clear to contributors.
- Consider adding commit signing or stronger policies (pre-commit/hooks, CI checks for whitespace/format/lint) to improve long-term VCS hygiene and reproducibility.
