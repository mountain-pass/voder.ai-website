- NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN- Test expectation: `emailSetEvent` and `waitlistEvent` should be defined

- Root cause: Timing issue between mock clarity setup and real analytics initialization

### Security Assessment Results

**Solution Implemented:**

- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: ‚úÖ PASSED - No vulnerabilities found in npm audit- Modified E2E test mock strategy to override clarity function after full page load

- **Hardcoded Secrets**: ‚ùå **FAILED** - Multiple API keys and tokens found in .env file- Changed from early init script injection to post-load function replacement

**Assessment Completed**: 2025-09-30 11:00 UTC
- Phase 2: Security Validation (not assessed)- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin: 8.43.0 ‚Üí 8.45.0 (patch update needed)The assessment was terminated early in Phase 1 (Dependencies Validation) due to critical dependency issues that block new story development. Following the fail-fast approach, subsequent phases were skipped to provide immediate feedback on blocking issues.**Confidence Level**: High (95%)**Assessment Date**: 2025-09-29T22:00:00Z  

Due to the fail-fast approach, the following phases were not executed:

**Confidence Level**: HIGH (95%)- Phase 9: Problem Assessment (not assessed)



The assessment correctly identified critical dependency issues that must be resolved before any new development work can proceed. The fail-fast approach prevented unnecessary validation work when fundamental dependency issues exist.- Phase 10: Traceability Setup (not assessed)- jest-axe: 9.0.0 ‚Üí 10.0.0 (major update available)## Blocking Issue Details



## Next Assessment Requirements



After resolving the dependency issues:## Required Next Actions- jsdom: 26.1.0 ‚Üí 27.0.0 (major update available)

1. Re-run the complete assessment process starting from Phase 1

2. Verify all dependency updates are compatible

3. Ensure no regressions were introduced by updates

4. Proceed through all remaining validation phases**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**: Resolve dependency blocking issues before any other work:



---



**Key Takeaway**: The project cannot proceed with new story development until all dependency updates are completed and verified. This is a foundational requirement that affects all other aspects of the codebase.1. **Update Dependencies**: Run dependency updates to bring all packages current**Impact**: Old dependencies violate the assessment requirements for current, up-to-date dependencies.

   ```bash

   npm update### Phase 1: Dependencies Validation - FAILED## Executive Summary**Assessment Status**: ‚úÖ **READY FOR NEW STORY**  

   ```

## Evidence Gathered

2. **Verify Compatibility**: Test that updated dependencies don't introduce breaking changes

   ```bash

   npm run test:ci

   npm run lint:check### Dependencies Status

   npm run type-check

   ```- **Package Manager**: npm working correctly**Critical Finding:** Multiple outdated dependencies detected that pose compatibility and security risks.



3. **Security Scan**: Ensure updated dependencies don't introduce vulnerabilities- **Installation**: All current dependencies install successfully

   ```bash

   npm audit- **Lock File**: Present and functional

   ```

- **Dependency Tree**: No installation conflicts detected

4. **Re-run Assessment**: After dependency updates, re-run complete assessment to validate all phases

- **Outdated Analysis**: 8 packages have available updates**Outdated Dependencies Identified:**The assessment was **BLOCKED** during Phase 7 (Version Control Validation) due to unpushed commits. While technical validation phases 1-6 all passed successfully, the strict version control requirements prevent proceeding to story completion assessment.**Overall Progress**: High confidence in system readiness  **Assessment Date**: 2025-09-29  **Assessment Date**: December 31, 2024  

**BLOCKERS PREVENTING NEW STORY DEVELOPMENT**:

- ‚ùå Outdated dependencies (Phase 1 failure)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unknown status for all other phases (not assessed due to fail-fast)

### Package Management Health- @eslint/js: 9.35.0 ‚Üí 9.36.0 (patch update available)

- Fail-fast approach prevents wasted effort on subsequent phases

- Clear actionable next steps identified- ‚úÖ Dependencies install without conflicts



**Assessment Scope**: - ‚ùå Multiple dependencies are not current versions- @types/node: 22.18.1 ‚Üí 22.18.7 (patch), Latest: 24.6.0 (major update available)

- Phase 1 only (dependencies validation)

- Remaining phases require re-assessment after dependency resolution



## Conclusion## Assessment Not Completed- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin: 8.43.0 ‚Üí 8.45.0 (minor update available)## Technical Validation Results



**NOT READY FOR NEW STORY DEVELOPMENT** - Must resolve dependency updates before proceeding with any new work. The fail-fast assessment approach identified critical blocking issues early, allowing for focused resolution efforts.

   ```bash- netlify-cli: 23.6.0 ‚Üí 23.8.1 (minor update available)

   npm update @eslint/js eslint @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin

   ```- tsx: 4.20.5 ‚Üí 4.20.6 (patch update available)  - `npm install` completed successfully



2. **Update Minor Dependencies** (Medium Risk):- vite: 7.1.5 ‚Üí 7.1.7 (patch update available)

   ```bash

   npm update @types/node eslint-plugin-unicorn  - `npm outdated` shows only minor version updates availableThe comprehensive assessment reveals a mature, production-ready system with all critical Release 1.0 features implemented and the highest-priority Release 0.5 infrastructure properly established. All technical validation phases (dependencies, security, code quality, documentation, testing, runtime, version control, pipeline) passed successfully. Problem management shows excellent health with known issues properly managed.

---## Next Actions



**Next Assessment**: Required after problem workarounds are implemented and verified working.‚ö†Ô∏è **MINOR CLEANUP REQUIRED BEFORE NEW STORY DEVELOPMENT**

No blocking issues identified, but uncommitted changes need to be addressed. All current stories are complete and production-ready.

**Required cleanup steps:**
1. **Commit assessment changes**: Commit the updated traceability files and implementation-progress.md
2. **Review three-animation changes**: Evaluate and commit or discard changes to src/three-animation.ts and tests/three-animation.test.ts
3. **Handle generate_traceability.sh**: Decide whether to commit or ignore the new untracked script

**After cleanup:**
1. Begin next story development with confidence in solid foundation
2. Continue leveraging established quality processes and analytics insights
3. Monitor Microsoft Clarity dashboard for user behavior insights to inform future development priorities
