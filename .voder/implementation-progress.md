Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 47.3

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (87.38% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The repository is well-structured and largely complete for a static pre-launch site: core functionality, linting, formatting, type-checking, and unit tests are in place and pass. However several CI and quality thresholds are below the required 90% (notably Testing, Execution, Dependencies, and Version Control), so the overall status is INCOMPLETE. To reach COMPLETE status we must raise test coverage (add integration/E2E tests), harden CI gating and execution determinism, and tighten dependency/version control practices (lockfile policies, remove unused prod deps, align pnpm/npm usage).

## NEXT PRIORITY
Add a focused E2E test suite (Playwright/Playwright+Vitest integration) to cover critical user flows and raise global coverage to >=90%, then gate CI so verify/test steps must pass before merges.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The repository is a small static pre-launch website whose core functionality is implemented: a clear main entry point (src/main.ts -> src/app.ts), unit tests exercise initialization and utility logic, tests all pass, and a production build succeeds. The project is functionally complete for its scope (static site + developer tooling) with working scripts and test coverage, but it lacks higher-level integration/e2e tests and runtime deployment verification.
- Main entry points present: src/main.ts (bootstraps the app) and src/app.ts (init function that renders content into #app).
- Package scripts implement dev, build, preview, test, type-check and verify flows (package.json contains expected scripts).
- Unit tests: ran `npm test` — Vitest ran 4 test files with 14 tests: all passed. Test runner output: '4 passed (4) / 14 passed (14)'.
- Build: ran `npm run build` — Vite produced a production build in dist/ (dist/index.html and asset files), build output completed successfully.
- Health-check utilities exist and are tested: scripts/health-check-utils.js exports parseVersion, compareSemver, and checkLockfileAndNodeModules; tests validate their behavior.
- app.init includes safe behavior when container is missing (logs error and returns) and tests cover both presence and absence of #app.
- Tests exercise main bootstrap logic: tests simulate document.readyState both 'loading' and 'complete' and validate DOMContentLoaded handling.
- No server/API endpoints or CLI beyond npm scripts are present (project is a static site), which matches repository purpose described in README.
- No failing tests, no build errors, and git status shows only local voder metadata modified (no evidence of unstable commits).

**Next Steps:**
- Add an end-to-end (E2E) browser test (Playwright or Cypress) to validate the actual rendered site in a headless browser (navigation, critical content, console errors).
- Add a simple CI job (or enable the provided verify script in CI) to run lint, build, and tests on PRs to prevent regressions.
- Add a lightweight preview/deployment check in CI (deploy to preview environment or run vite preview and run headless checks) to catch runtime issues not covered by unit tests.
- Increase functional coverage by adding tests for any interactive/visual behavior (if expanded beyond static content) and add accessibility checks for key pages.
- Document developer workflow for running the dev server (npm run dev) and previewing the build in README with expected URLs and ports to help contributors verify functionality quickly.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (90% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- Overall code quality is high: linters and formatters are configured and enforced, tests pass, build and type-check succeed, and the repository is well-organized. A few minor maintenance items (deprecated ESLint rule usage and some permissive TypeScript lint rules) keep this from being near-perfect.
- Linting configuration present and opinionated: eslint.config.ts plus a layered config under config/eslint (base, dx, performance). stylelint.config.ts and htmlhint.config.js also present.
- Prettier configuration present (prettier.config.ts) and format check passed: 'All matched files use Prettier code style!'
- npm scripts include lint, lint:fix, lint:check (with --max-warnings 0), format, format:check, and lint:css/html/md scripts — good developer ergonomics for enforcement.
- Running ESLint on the repository produced zero errors/warnings for the files inspected (ESLint output shows many files but errorCount and warningCount are 0).
- Vitest test suite ran and passed: 4 test files, 14 tests passed (we executed `npm test`).
- Build succeeded (vite build completed and produced dist/ files) when running `npm run build`.
- Type-checking is configured (tsconfig.json + scripts). The project built successfully and the type-check script ran without visible errors in my runs.
- Small, well-structured source: src contains app.ts and main.ts with clear separation; tests exercise edge-cases (DOM loading, missing #app) and some utility scripts.
- Error handling and defensive coding present: e.g., src/app.ts checks for missing DOM element and logs an error; scripts/health-check-utils.js returns null / checks for invalid input and handles filesystem existence safely.
- Tests avoid repository mutations and use temporary directories where needed (good test hygiene).
- ESLint reported usage of a deprecated formatting rule (padding-line-between-statements) across many configs (reported as usedDeprecatedRules). This is not causing lint failures but indicates a maintenance/update needed to migrate to the stylistic plugin.
- TypeScript-lint policy is pragmatic but permissive in some areas: '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any' is turned off and 'no-var' is left off — acceptable for small project but less strict than a hardened production policy.

**Next Steps:**
- Migrate deprecated ESLint formatting rules (padding-line-between-statements) to the recommended replacement (e.g., ESLint Stylistic plugin) to remove deprecation noise and stay compatible with future ESLint releases.
- Consider tightening TypeScript-related lint rules for stricter correctness (enable/raise enforcement for no-explicit-any, prefer avoiding 'no-var' being off) if the team wants stronger type safety.
- Ensure CI runs the full lint matrix (eslint, stylelint, htmlhint, markdownlint) and that lint:check and format:check are part of CI verify pipelines (the package.json 'verify' script exists — ensure CI invokes it).
- Add an explicit step in CI to fail on usedDeprecatedRules (or make ESLint deprecation output more visible) so maintainers are alerted early when eslint core rules are deprecated.
- Increase test coverage for more of runtime behaviour where applicable (this is a small site today, but as features grow, add unit/integration tests for new logic to keep coverage healthy).

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (85% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- Project has a solid unit test suite using Vitest with all tests passing locally and V8 coverage reporting 100% for the core app files. Tests are unit-focused (jsdom) and cover app initialization and several utility scripts, but there are no integration or end-to-end browser tests and the test surface is relatively small.
- Test files present in tests/: coverage-increase.test.ts, health-check-utils.test.ts, main.test.ts, prepare-libraries.test.ts and tests/setup.ts.
- Testing framework: Vitest configured via vitest.config.ts; vitest is defined in package.json scripts (test, test:coverage, test:ci).
- Local test run (npm run test:ci) executed 14 tests across 4 files; all tests passed.
- Coverage: Vitest with V8 produced coverage output showing 100% statements/branches/functions/lines for app.ts and main.ts and 100% overall in the produced report.
- Test types: primarily unit tests that exercise module logic and DOM behavior under jsdom/happy-dom. prepare-libraries tests simulate filesystem behavior.
- No end-to-end browser tests (Playwright, Puppeteer) or explicit integration tests were found in the repository.
- No failing tests or recent CI failures were observed during inspection; no CI logs indicating test instability were found in the repo.

**Next Steps:**
- Add integration and end-to-end browser tests (e.g., Playwright) to validate real browser behavior, user flows, and accessibility beyond jsdom unit tests.
- Increase test coverage across more runtime modules and critical code paths so coverage reflects the broader codebase, not just app.ts/main.ts.
- Ensure the test command and coverage run in CI (GitHub Actions) with artifacts or badges; add coverage thresholds to fail PRs when coverage drops.
- Harden tests that manipulate globals/events (e.g., document.readyState) to reduce flakiness and add retries or stable event waiting if needed.
- Add tests for error and edge cases in scripts and build tooling (scripts/prepare-libraries.js, health-check scripts) to catch regressions earlier.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (88% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- The project executes and builds reliably: dependencies install, TypeScript type-check, production build, and the test suite all succeed with no errors. The runtime is a small static Vite app with minimal but adequate runtime checks. The preview server could not be verified as continuously reachable in this environment, and runtime error handling is minimal, so there is some room for improvement.
- Environment: Node v22.17.1 (satisfies package.json engines requirement)
- Dependencies installed successfully via `npm ci` (added 662 packages; 0 vulnerabilities reported).
- `npm run build` completed successfully (Vite build output: dist files generated).
- `npm run test` (Vitest) ran successfully: 4 test files, 14 tests passed (no failures).
- `npm run health-check` passed all checks: TypeScript type-check OK, ESLint check OK, Prettier check OK.
- Source runtime: src/main.ts and src/app.ts are small and straightforward. init() checks for '#app' and logs an error if the element is missing (console.error and graceful return) — basic error handling is present.
- Runtime dependencies are declared (three runtime deps: @microsoft/clarity, gsap, three) and resolved during install. Build succeeded despite these dependencies, indicating no missing runtime modules for the shipped bundle.
- Attempt to start a preview server (via the preview script) could not be verified as listening in this environment — background start did not leave a persistent process accessible on port 5173 during the check (no HTTP response observed). The build artifacts (dist/) were created, but an externally reachable preview server was not confirmed.
- Logs and command outputs examined showed no build/test errors or warnings; outputs indicate a healthy CI-local experience for build/test/lint/type-check.

**Next Steps:**
- Verify and fix preview/server start behavior: reproduce `npm run preview` locally and ensure it stays running and listens on the expected port in CI/dev environments. Add a smoke check in CI that curls the preview URL after startup.
- Add an end-to-end or headless browser smoke test (e.g., Playwright or vitest + run_headless_browser_test) to verify the application actually serves the built page and renders the expected content in a browser environment.
- Improve runtime logging and error handling beyond the single '#app' check (e.g., centralized error reporting, clearer startup logs, and return codes for lifecycle failures).
- Add CI step to run the preview and the headless smoke test, or add an npm script that performs build + preview + smoke test to validate production artifacts in automated runs.
- If portability across OSes is required, ensure shell commands in scripts (like clean using rm -rf) are cross-platform or guarded; add tests or CI matrix runs on supported platforms if necessary.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is generally strong for developer onboarding and internal architecture: there is a clear README with setup and usage instructions, a dedicated developer setup guide, many architectural decision records (ADRs) and library notes, and security/audit artifacts. Missing or incomplete items include an explicit changelog/release notes, API documentation (no API.md or similar), an empty CI-AUDIT.md, and one referenced docs helper script (setup-package-docs.js) that is not present in the repository.
- README.md exists and contains clear Quick start instructions (prereqs, npm ci, npm run dev/build/preview), testing, lint/format commands, troubleshooting and contact guidance.
- docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md provides a step-by-step non-interactive verification sequence (type-check, lint, format, build, test:coverage) and CI recommendations — good contributor onboarding material.
- Architectural documentation: docs/decisions contains many ADR files (e.g., 0000-use-markdown-architectural-decision-records-madr-40.accepted.md, 0001-use-vite-as-the-frontend-build-tool.accepted.md, etc.), showing recorded architecture/tech decisions.
- Library notes: docs/libraries contains multiple markdown files documenting chosen libraries and rationale (e.g., vite.md, typescript.md, eslint.md and many others).
- Security & audit docs: SECURITY.md exists with guidance and references to audit artifacts; audit-summary.md and ci-audit-summary.md are present and show results.
- Developer utilities and scripts are documented (scripts/health-check.js, scripts/prepare-libraries.js) and referenced in README and docs.
- Tests exist under tests/ and README/doc mention how to run tests and generate coverage; unit tests target src/ and the code is small and straightforward.
- Code comments: source files have minimal comments (e.g., src/app.ts and src/main.ts include short explanatory comments). There are no JSDoc blocks or extensive inline docstrings for public APIs.
- No API documentation found — searched for API.md or similar and none was present; appropriate for a static site but a missing pain point if any programmatic surface exists.
- No changelog or release notes found (no CHANGELOG.md or similar).
- docs/CI-AUDIT.md file exists but is empty (0 bytes / no content).
- package.json contains scripts docs:setup and docs:report that call setup-package-docs.js, but search did not find a setup-package-docs.js file in the repository (referenced helper appears missing).
- Some referenced documentation-generation tooling appears incomplete or not checked in (see missing setup-package-docs.js).
- Many documentation files and CI workflows (.github/workflows/*) are present and consistent (CI workflow references verify script which is documented).

**Next Steps:**
- Add a changelog or release notes (CHANGELOG.md) and a release process section in docs/ to track user-visible changes and versioning.
- If any programmatic API exists or is planned, add API documentation (API.md or docs/api/) and examples. If not, add a short note in README stating there is no public API.
- Populate docs/CI-AUDIT.md (it is currently empty) or remove it if not needed.
- Either add the referenced setup-package-docs.js (used by npm run docs:setup/docs:report) or remove/update the package.json scripts to avoid dangling references.
- Improve inline documentation: add JSDoc/type comments for exported functions (e.g., src/app.ts init()) to make intent and usage clearer for maintainers.
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md (and optionally CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to guide external contributors on the workflow, branching, and PR expectations.
- Consider a short release checklist in docs (testing, audit, changelog update) and link it from README to ensure documentation remains up to date with code changes.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are declared, locked, installed and audited with no known vulnerabilities. Tests run successfully and the project contains a package-lock.json and node_modules. Minor issues: possible unused production dependencies (gsap, three, @microsoft/clarity not referenced in source), inability to run an automated 'npm outdated' check in this environment, and a small CI/config inconsistency (pnpm setup step but npm ci used).
- package.json lists 3 production deps (@microsoft/clarity, gsap, three) and many devDependencies; engines.node is set to >=22.17.0.
- A package-lock.json exists in the repository (check_file_exists returned true) and node_modules/ is present.
- npm audit --json returned an audit report with 0 vulnerabilities (critical/high/moderate/low = 0). The repository includes audit.json and audit-summary.md reflecting zero vulnerabilities.
- npm ls --depth=0 --json shows installed packages consistent with package.json (no extraneous packages reported at top level). Audit metadata reports total dependencies: prod 27, dev 739 (from audit JSON).
- Project tests run locally: npm run test completed with 14 passing tests (Vitest).
- Search across the repository did not find references to 'gsap', 'three', or 'clarity' (no matches via grep), suggesting those production dependencies may be unused or not yet integrated into source.
- Attempt to run 'npm outdated --json' failed in this environment (command returned an error). This prevented an automated check for outdated packages here.
- CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) sets up pnpm (pnpm/action-setup@v2) but then runs 'npm ci' which is an inconsistency in package manager setup and could cause confusion in CI dependency resolution.

**Next Steps:**
- Run 'npm outdated' (or 'npm outdated --json') in your environment to identify outdated packages and plan upgrades. If network or environment causes failures, run locally or in CI where network access is available.
- Remove or move unused production dependencies: if gsap, three, and @microsoft/clarity are not used at runtime, either remove them or move them to devDependencies. Use tools like depcheck or `eslint --rule no-unused-vars` and manually verify imports before removing.
- Keep package-lock.json committed and ensure CI and local workflows use the same package manager (either switch CI to npm or change install step to pnpm install) to avoid divergence between lockfile and install tool.
- Add automated dependency update tooling (Dependabot, Renovate) to keep dependencies up-to-date and reduce bitrot; configure PR tests to run when deps are updated.
- Continue running 'npm audit' regularly and consider adding it to CI gating (with appropriate thresholds). Also run 'npm audit fix' where safe and review any proposed fixes before applying.
- Consider periodic deeper dependency hygiene: run 'npm prune', 'npm dedupe', and test after upgrades; add a routine (weekly/biweekly) to check for minor/patch updates and a plan for major upgrades.
- If you rely on many devDependencies in CI, consider shrinking the devDeps footprint or caching strategies and confirm the dev/prod separation is correct (no large dev deps included in production builds).
- Address the CI package manager inconsistency: either remove pnpm/action-setup or change the install step to use pnpm (pnpm ci) so the CI environment matches the package manager used by the team.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository demonstrates a strong security posture with multiple automated scans (npm audit, gitleaks secret scan, CodeQL) and tooling (Dependabot, SBOM attempt, pre-commit checks). Concrete weaknesses: no package-lock.json in the repo (reduces reproducible installs/audits) and some SBOM/scan steps are allowed to not block jobs (SBOM generation is optional). No hardcoded secrets were found in the visible files and npm audit artifacts show zero current vulnerabilities.
- Automated security workflows present: .github/workflows/security-audit.yml (npm audit + SBOM), .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml (gitleaks), .github/workflows/code-scanning.yml (CodeQL).
- Audit artifacts in repo show no current vulnerabilities: audit.json and audit-summary.md (npm audit metadata: 0 critical/high/moderate/low/info).
- Secret scan artifacts present but redacted outputs in repo are empty: repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt and repo-secrets-scan.txt are present but empty; raw repo-secrets-scan.json is excluded by ignore (artifact expected from workflow).
- parse-audit.js (.github/scripts/parse-audit.js) is present and enforces failing on high/critical advisories (script exits nonzero if high/critical found), and the security-audit workflow runs this parser (step will fail if it exits nonzero).
- Gitleaks secret-scan workflow is configured to fail if secrets are detected and uploads artifacts (secret-scan.yml).
- CodeQL scanning is configured and scheduled (code-scanning.yml), with SARIF upload for triage.
- Dependabot is enabled and configured for weekly npm updates (.github/dependabot.yml).
- Pre-commit hooks (.husky/pre-commit) enforce type-check, lint, and format checks locally to prevent some classes of errors from being committed.
- Health-check script (scripts/health-check.js) explicitly warns and fails if package-lock.json or node_modules is missing; in the repo there is no package-lock.json committed, which reduces install reproducibility and can affect audit reproducibility.
- No obvious hardcoded secrets or credentials found in source files (searches for token/DSN/key/password/secret returned no matches in visible files).
- CI references an env secret (VITE_SENTRY_DSN) in .github/workflows/ci.yml and does not include it in repo — correct usage of secrets rather than hardcoding.

**Next Steps:**
- Commit a package-lock.json (or other lockfile) to the repository to ensure reproducible installs and more reliable npm audit results. If you intentionally avoid committing a lockfile for a library, document the rationale clearly in README/SECURITY.md.
- Make SBOM generation a required step (or fail the job) when SBOM tooling is available, so SBOM artifacts are reliably produced and reviewed; currently SBOM generation is best-effort and can silently skip.
- Ensure repo-secrets-scan.json artifact is retained and accessible from CI runs for triage (the redacted text file is present but empty in repo — confirm gitleaks runs and artifacts in Actions and review them regularly).
- Enable Dependabot 'security-only' updates or auto-merge for low-risk patch updates, and ensure maintainers review and merge critical dependency updates promptly.
- Add a documented security contact and clear incident/triage process to SECURITY.md (who to notify, how to report a vulnerability), and include expected SLAs for high/critical findings.
- Consider adding additional repository-level protections: branch protection rules requiring passing security workflows, required CodeQL/secret-scan checks for PRs, and limiting who can bypass checks.
- If the site integrates analytics/third-party services (e.g., Microsoft Clarity), review initialization code (not present in src now) to ensure no secrets are embedded client-side and that opt-out/privacy controls are documented.
- Periodically review and rotate any external secrets referenced in CI (e.g., VITE_SENTRY_DSN) and ensure they use least privilege and short lifetimes where possible.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (88% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- Version control is well-established: a clear commit history with good, conventional commit messages, active recent commits, a remote on GitHub, branch upstream configured, CI workflows present, and a sensible .gitignore. Remaining issues are an unclean working directory (two unstaged local changes) and several large/binary assets and a .voder directory tracked in Git that may be better handled via ignore rules or Git LFS.
- git status shows two modified files in the working tree: .voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md (porcelain output: '1 .M ... .voder/history.md' and '.voder/last-action.md'). Working directory is not clean.
- Commit history (git log -n 50) is active and recent. Examples: '213ccba  voder-bot  docs(security): document scheduled scans...' and many descriptive commits using conventional prefixes (ci, chore, docs, feat, fix).
- Branch structure: current branch is 'fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage' with upstream set to origin/fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage. Multiple feature/cleanup branches exist and remote branches are present (git branch -a output).
- Remote configured: origin -> https://github.com/mountain-pass/voder.ai-website.git (fetch & push).
- .gitignore exists and contains appropriate patterns (node_modules/, dist/, .env*, coverage/, .eslintcache, .DS_Store, etc.).
- .husky/pre-commit exists (hook present), and GitHub Actions workflows are present (.github/workflows/*) including CI and security scanning workflows.
- Important repo files are tracked: README.md, package.json, package-lock.json, SECURITY.md, many docs and config files, and test config—git ls-files shows a comprehensive set of tracked source and config files.
- Large/binary assets and many fonts/GLB files are tracked under assets/ and public/ (e.g., assets/inter/fonts/*, assets/*.glb). These may bloat the git history and are candidates for Git LFS or external hosting.
- A .voder directory (and many .voder files) are committed to the repository. Some .voder artifacts appear to be runtime/system metadata; the repository also contains a .voderignore file. Prettier and other checks have been configured to ignore some transient .voder artifacts (commits reference ignoring .voder in checks).
- Repository contains audit artifact files (audit.json, audit-summary.md, ci-audit.json) committed in the tree; there are commits and scripts to generate/parse these artifacts.
- Commit authorship is dominated by an automation account 'voder-bot' in recent history which is fine for automated changes but human authored commits are less visible in the recent window.

**Next Steps:**
- Clean the working directory: review and either commit, stash, or discard changes to .voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md so the working tree is clean before creating PRs or releases.
- Decide how to treat .voder artifacts: if they are transient/system metadata, add them to .gitignore (or narrow what is tracked) to avoid noisy commits; if they must be tracked, document their intended use and lifecycle.
- Consider moving large binary assets (fonts, .glb files) to Git LFS or an external asset host to avoid inflating the git history and to improve clone/fetch performance.
- Ensure branch protection rules and CI status checks are configured on the GitHub repository (protect main, require passing CI, required reviews) if not already enforced server-side.
- Run a repository secret scan and remove any sensitive data from history if found (there are repo-secrets-scan files present; confirm they are redacted and no secrets are committed).
- If automation commits (voder-bot) are intended, ensure commit signature/attribution policy is documented and consider adding human-friendly messages on high-impact changes for traceability.
