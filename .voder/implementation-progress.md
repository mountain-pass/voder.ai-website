## Recommendations

### Critical Actions Required (Blockers)

1. **Fix Coverage Thresholds**: Add tests for traffic-analytics.ts to reach 90% line and branch coverage
2. **Commit Changes**: Stage and commit the modified implementation-progress.md file  
3. **Add New Story File**: Stage and commit the new 019.0-PO-ANALYTICS-ENGAGEMENT.md story

### Coverage Improvement Plan

The main coverage gaps are in `traffic-analytics.ts`:
- **Lines missing**: 596, 607-634, 641-643 (error handling and edge cases)
- **Branches missing**: Error conditions and fallback scenarios  
- **Recommended**: Add tests for error scenarios, API failures, and edge cases
