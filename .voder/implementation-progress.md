Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 56.9

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (73.63% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The repository is well-structured with strong tooling, tests, and CI verification, but the implementation is incomplete because dependency assessment failed and several areas (Dependencies, Documentation, Security) fall below required thresholds. Unit tests and build steps pass, but dependency audit automation and documentation need prioritized attention to reach the 90%+ and 80%+ gates specified.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Stabilize dependency assessment: run non-interactive npm audit locally, parse results, apply package-lock-only fixes or open focused dependency upgrade PRs so CI audit returns no high/critical advisories.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (90% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- A focused static pre-launch website with clear entry points and good test coverage. Core functionality (app initialization and rendering into #app) is implemented and covered by passing unit tests. Build and dev scripts exist; no backend/API or CLI is present (consistent with a static site).
- Main entry points exist: src/main.ts (bootstraps on DOM ready) and src/app.ts (init function that renders content into #app).
- index.html references /src/main.ts as the module entry for the browser (intended to be served by Vite).
- Unit tests under tests/ run successfully: 'npm test' executed locally and reported 4 test files, 14 tests — all passing.
- scripts/health-check-utils.js provides parseVersion, compareSemver, and checkLockfileAndNodeModules; these functions are tested and pass.
- package.json contains standard dev workflow scripts: dev (vite), build (tsc + vite build), preview, type-check, lint, and test.
- src/app.ts handles missing #app gracefully (logs error and returns) and this behavior is covered by tests.
- No server-side API endpoints, CLI entry points, or integration/end-to-end tests were found — repository scope appears to be a static front-end site.
- Git history shows recent commits focused on CI/security artifacts; no evidence of failing CI in the checked repository state.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the dev server (npm run dev) and manually verify the site in a browser to confirm runtime/visual behavior not captured by jsdom tests.
- Perform a production build and preview (npm run build && npm run preview) to validate build output and asset resolution.
- Add a headless browser end-to-end test (Playwright/Playwright-run or run_headless_browser_test) to catch runtime issues not visible in jsdom unit tests.
- If additional functionality is planned (APIs or CLI), introduce explicit entry points and integration tests for those components.
- Document the Node >=22.17.0 requirement prominently in CONTRIBUTING or setup notes to reduce onboarding friction for developers.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (88% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Overall the repository shows a well-structured, high-quality setup: ESLint, Stylelint, Prettier, TypeScript and Vitest are configured and CI scripts exist. The source code is small, tests pass, and the production build succeeds. There are a few tooling friction points (Prettier config in TypeScript requiring special NODE_OPTIONS and linter runs that can pick up generated coverage CSS), but these are implementation/usage issues rather than missing quality controls.
- Linting configuration present and layered: eslint.config.ts and a complete ESLint flat config under config/eslint (base.ts, dx.ts, performance.ts).
- ESLint is available and configured for TypeScript (uses @typescript-eslint parser & plugin). Running `npx eslint --print-config src/app.ts` returned the effective config (shows TypeScript-aware rules and plugins).
- Project provides npm scripts for linting & checks in package.json (lint, lint:fix, lint:check, lint:css, format, format:check, verify).
- Running tests: `npm test` (Vitest) ran successfully: 4 test files, 14 tests — all passed (output captured from test run).
- Build succeeded: `npm run build` produced a dist and finished successfully (Vite build output captured).
- ESLint runs on source files with no visible errors when invoked via the project's scripts (no failing output from `npm run lint` in this environment).
- Stylelint is configured (stylelint.config.ts) and the repo includes linting scripts. Running stylelint across the repository without ignore patterns produced many errors in generated coverage CSS files (coverage/base.css and coverage/prettify.css) — 118 problems reported by stylelint when invoked globally. The project's lint:css script includes ignore-patterns for coverage/dist/build which prevents these from failing CI when used as intended.
- Prettier config is implemented in TypeScript (prettier.config.ts). Invoking Prettier CLI directly without NODE_OPTIONS (used in package.json scripts) caused an error: 'Unknown file extension ".ts" for prettier.config.ts'. The package.json format/format:check scripts set NODE_OPTIONS to handle this, so the project relies on that environment flag.
- TypeScript configuration exists and is used (tsconfig.json references project TS config and includes config folder and tooling files).
- Code organization: src contains a small, clean codebase (app.ts, main.ts, style.css). The application code is straightforward, testable (init() extracted), and includes basic error handling (logs error if #app is missing).
- No evidence of significant code duplication or poor naming in the source files (small code surface area).
- CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs type-check, format check, eslint check, build, and tests and uploads logs and coverage — indicates enforcement of quality gates in CI.

**Next Steps:**
- If you want Prettier CLI to work without special NODE_OPTIONS, convert prettier.config.ts to a JS or JSON config (prettier.config.cjs / .prettierrc.js) or add a small bootstrap JS that imports the TS config — this reduces friction for contributors who run Prettier directly.
- Ensure generated artifacts (coverage/, dist/, build/) are always excluded from ad-hoc linter invocations. The current npm lint:css script includes ignore patterns; consider documenting common pitfalls (or adding a top-level stylelint ignore file) so direct CLI runs don't pick up coverage/* by mistake.
- Run the full verification sequence locally (npm run verify) and ensure developers use the same commands as CI. This confirms the environment-specific flags (NODE_OPTIONS) behave consistently for contributors.
- Consider enabling a stricter set of ESLint rules incrementally (e.g., re-enable some @typescript-eslint stricter rules such as no-explicit-any or reduce allowed console usage) and enforce them in lint:check to raise code quality further.
- Add lint-staged / pre-commit hooks (if not already present in .husky) to run format and lint:fix on changed files to avoid style regressions.
- Add automated checks to ensure stylelint is run with the project's ignore patterns (or use the project's npm scripts in CI) so generated files cannot cause false negatives.
- As the codebase grows, add static-analysis/duplication checks (e.g., SonarCloud or a duplication detector) and increase test coverage targets enforced by CI.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Good testing setup: a test suite using Vitest + jsdom with tests present and passing locally, and 100% coverage for the repository's source files. Tests are unit/jsdom-level and cover the small codebase well. The project has CI workflows that run tests and collect coverage and reference E2E tooling, but there are no end-to-end (Playwright) tests in the repository.
- Tests found: 4 test files under tests/ (main.test.ts, coverage-increase.test.ts, health-check-utils.test.ts, prepare-libraries.test.ts) and a tests/setup.ts file.
- Testing framework: Vitest is configured and used (package.json scripts: test, test:watch, test:coverage, test:ci). Dev dependencies include vitest, @testing-library/dom, @testing-library/jest-dom, jsdom, happy-dom, etc.
- Vitest configuration present (vitest.config.ts and config/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts). Coverage provider set to v8 with reporter configuration and coverage thresholds (90% branches/functions/lines/statements) in createVitestJsdomConfig.
- Local test run: npm run test succeeded — 4 test files, 14 tests — all passed.
- Coverage: npm run test:coverage produced a v8 report showing 100% statements/branches/functions/lines for app.ts and main.ts and 100% overall (the repo's source files are app.ts and main.ts).
- Test types: tests exercise DOM behavior under jsdom, module-level behavior, and some filesystem-simulation/unit tests. These are unit-level and small integration-style tests; no end-to-end/browser automation tests were found in the repository.
- CI: .github/workflows/ci.yml runs type-check, lint, build and test:ci, uploads logs and coverage, and has steps that reference E2E/Playwright and Lighthouse CI. However, the repo does not contain Playwright test files.
- No failing tests or recent test failures were detected locally. Git status shows only working tree mods unrelated to test failures; no CI logs were available to indicate historical failures.

**Next Steps:**
- Add E2E/browser tests (Playwright) if the CI intends to run multi-browser tests — the CI references Playwright but no E2E tests are present. Create at least one simple E2E to validate the real UI in a browser environment.
- Broaden test coverage as the codebase grows: add tests for new modules, interactions with three/gsap behaviors (where testable), and any async flows. Keep unit/integration separation clear.
- Consider adding accessibility tests (axe / jest-axe) and visual regression or snapshot tests for key UI pieces to increase confidence for UI changes.
- Ensure CI executes the same package manager/commands as local dev (CI sets up pnpm but runs npm ci) and validate test:ci in CI mirrors local expectations (including coverage thresholds causing failure when unmet).
- If desired, enforce coverage thresholds in CI by failing the build when thresholds are not met (current config includes thresholds but verify vitest's behavior in test:ci).
- Document testing strategy in README or CONTRIBUTING (how to run tests, coverage commands, adding tests, and CI expectations) so contributors can reproduce runs locally.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Execution is strong: dependencies install, build, and test steps run successfully and the code has basic runtime error handling. The production build (dist) is produced and unit tests (Vitest) all pass. The development server was started by the harness but network probing of the dev/preview endpoints timed out in this environment, so full runtime smoke-testing of the served site could not be verified here.
- Dependencies installed successfully with `npm ci`. The prepare script ran and reported: packages examined: 36, created: 35, skipped: 1 (evidence: npm ci output).
- Build succeeded: `npm run build` ran tsc and vite build, producing dist assets (dist/index.html, dist/assets/*.js, dist/assets/*.css) with Vite reporting a successful build.
- Type checking executed as part of the build step (tsc -p tsconfig.build.json) and did not fail during the build.
- All tests passed: `npm run test` (Vitest) output shows 4 test files, 14 tests total — 4 passed files, 14 passed tests; no test failures or errors.
- Application initialization code (src/app.ts) includes basic runtime error handling: logs to console.error and returns when the #app element is missing.
- Scripts include defensive handling and fallbacks — e.g., scripts/prepare-libraries.js attempts a symlink and falls back to copying; it logs summary and exits non-zero on errors.
- Health-check utilities (scripts/health-check-utils.js) include input validation and are covered by tests (parseVersion, compareSemver, checkLockfileAndNodeModules).
- Dev server start was invoked via the start_server tool and a background process was created, but network checks (wait-on) and `npm run preview` failed with ETIMEDOUT in this execution environment, preventing verification that the site is reachable on the expected port.
- No runtime exceptions or test failures were observed in the captured command outputs; lint/format checks were not run in this assessment but scripts exist for them in package.json.

**Next Steps:**
- Verify the running dev server and production preview in a normal environment: run `npm run dev`, open http://localhost:5173 and confirm the page renders; run `npm run preview` after `npm run build` and confirm the preview server serves the built site.
- Add an automated smoke test in CI that boots the preview server and performs a simple HTTP check (or headless browser test) to confirm the built site serves successfully — this will catch runtime serving issues (the current environment timed out during preview checks).
- Capture and persist server logs from development/preview steps in CI so start failures or runtime errors are visible and actionable.
- Consider adding an explicit 'start' script for production hosting (if relevant) or documenting recommended preview/serve steps in README to make runtime verification consistent across environments.
- Run lint/format (`npm run lint` and `npm run format:check`) as part of verification locally or in CI to ensure codebase standards are enforced alongside build/test checks.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (75% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Documentation coverage is good for developer setup and architectural decisions (README, DEVELOPER-SETUP, ADRs, library notes, CI workflows, SECURITY.md), and the README instructions are accurate (tests run successfully). Missing items: no changelog/release notes, no API reference, limited inline code docstrings, and a few docs files appear empty or incomplete.
- README.md present and contains clear quick-start instructions (install, run, build, test, lint, format, verify).
- Developer onboarding doc exists: docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md provides step-by-step verification and CI-local guidance.
- Architectural documentation: multiple ADRs under docs/decisions (0000..0024) present and populated with accepted decisions.
- Library/package notes: docs/libraries contains markdown pages describing various dependencies and rationale.
- Security and audit docs exist: SECURITY.md, audit-summary.md and .github workflow security-audit.yml present and consistent.
- CI docs/workflows: .github/workflows/ci.yml details verification steps matching README and package.json scripts.
- Tests were executed as part of assessment: running `npm test` completed with 4 test files, 14 tests, all passing (Vitest output). This confirms test/run instructions in README are accurate.
- Some documentation files appear empty or sparse: docs/CI-AUDIT.md is empty (0 bytes).
- No changelog or release notes found (no CHANGELOG.md or similar).
- No API reference or generated API docs found (no API.md, docs/api, or typedoc output).
- Code-level documentation is minimal: source files (src/app.ts, src/main.ts) contain only brief comments, with no TSDoc/JSDoc on exported functions.
- No CONTRIBUTING.md or explicit contribution guidelines file was found (contributors are referenced in README but no dedicated CONTRIBUTING).
- No LICENSE file present; package.json license is set to 'UNLICENSED' (may be intentional but is notable for documentation of project licensing).

**Next Steps:**
- Add a changelog (CHANGELOG.md) or adopt a conventional changelog/release notes process and document it in README/CONTRIBUTING so users see notable changes and releases.
- Provide API documentation if the project exposes any public APIs — e.g., add an API.md or generate typedoc output and link it from README.
- Improve inline code documentation: add TSDoc/JSDoc comments for exported functions and complex modules to make the codebase more discoverable for contributors.
- Populate or remove empty documentation files (e.g., docs/CI-AUDIT.md) to avoid confusion; ensure all docs contain useful content or an explicit TODO note.
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines, branching strategy, commit conventions, and how to run verification locally (link to docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md).
- Add a top-level architecture overview (short ARCHITECTURE.md or README section) summarizing high-level design, tech choices, and runtime flow to complement the ADRs.
- Consider adding a LICENSE file or clearly documenting licensing and distribution expectations in the repository if applicable.
- Add a short docs-maintenance checklist to ensure docs are updated when package.json scripts, CI steps, or test commands change (e.g., include a pre-release checklist in DEVELOPER-SETUP or README).

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (0% ± 20% COMPLETE)
- Assessment failed due to error: 400 Input tokens exceed the configured limit of 272000 tokens. Your messages resulted in 291341 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages.
- Error occurred during DEPENDENCIES assessment: 400 Input tokens exceed the configured limit of 272000 tokens. Your messages resulted in 291341 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages.

**Next Steps:**
- Check assessment system configuration
- Verify project accessibility

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (78% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Overall security hygiene is good for a small static site: CI includes an npm audit workflow that fails on high/critical issues, a packaged audit report shows no current vulnerabilities, there's a SECURITY.md, and the repo contains lockfile and audit scripts. Missing or weak areas: no Dependabot/automated dependency updates, no CodeQL or static-analysis workflow, no automated secret-scanning workflow in CI (only offline redacted scan artifacts present), and some advanced supply-chain protections (provenance, signed releases) are not present.
- Found a dedicated security audit workflow: .github/workflows/security-audit.yml that checks out code, sets up Node, runs npm ci, runs npm audit --json and parses results with .github/scripts/parse-audit.js. The parser fails the job if any high/critical advisories are detected.
- There is an existing audit.json and audit-summary.md in the repo showing zero vulnerabilities (audit.json.metadata.vulnerabilities reports all severities = 0).
- package.json includes security-related scripts: "audit:fix" (npm audit fix --package-lock-only) and "security:local" (run npm audit and parse it locally).
- A package-lock.json is present (checked), which helps reproducible installs and audit accuracy; the health-check script verifies lockfile and node_modules presence.
- A SECURITY.md is included with immediate guidance and reproduction steps for maintainers.
- CI (ci.yml) uses a secret VITE_SENTRY_DSN via ${ { secrets.VITE_SENTRY_DSN } } — the repo references secrets correctly in workflows rather than hardcoding them in visible files.
- There are repo-secrets-scan.txt and repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt artifacts in the repo, but they are empty/contain no clear leaked secrets in the repository snapshot analyzed.
- No automated dependency update configuration was found in .github (no .github/dependabot.yml), so dependency updates may not be automated.
- No CodeQL, Snyk, or other code-scanning workflows were found; static-analysis security scans beyond npm audit are not present in .github/workflows.
- No secret-scanning workflow was found (relying on offline/manual secret-scan artifacts instead of enforced CI scanning or GitHub Advanced Security secret scanning).
- This is primarily a static front-end website with minimal attack surface (no server-side auth or input handling in repo), so many server-focused checks (authz, input validation) are not applicable to the current codebase.

**Next Steps:**
- Add automated dependency update tooling (Dependabot or Renovate) with PR tests enabled so minor/patch upgrades are proposed automatically and tested before merge.
- Add a secret-scanning workflow (e.g., GitHub secret scanning, truffleHog/git-secrets/Gitleaks) to CI to prevent accidental secret commits and fail PRs if new secrets are detected.
- Add a code scanning/security static-analysis workflow (GitHub CodeQL or Snyk) to detect code-level issues beyond npm audit.
- Keep the npm audit step configured to run on pull requests (security-audit.yml runs on push/PR to main only) — consider running npm audit on PRs or configuring dependabot PR checks to include npm audit results.
- Enable branch protection rules on main (require passing CI, require review) and ensure workflows run on PRs from forks safely (avoid leaking secrets to untrusted PRs).
- Enforce lockfile verification in CI (fail PRs that update package-lock.json unexpectedly) or run 'npm ci' in PR checks to prevent dependency drift.
- Regularly re-run repo secret scans and rotate any credentials if the redacted scan ever shows sensitive values; also remove any accidental secrets found historically from git history (git filter-repo/bfg).
- Consider adding supply-chain hardening for releases (signing releases, SLSA provenance where applicable) if the project moves beyond a static marketing site.
- Document security expectations and contributor guidance in SECURITY.md or CONTRIBUTING.md: how to handle secrets, how to run local scans, and whom to contact for incident response.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Version control is well maintained with a clear commit history, sensible branching, tags and pre-commit hooks. Minor issues: a non-clean working tree with tracked .voder transient files, large binary assets committed without Git LFS, and some CI/audit artifacts present in the repository that may be generated/transient.
- Working directory is not clean: git status shows .voder/.processes.json deleted and .voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md modified (porcelain output: D .voder/.processes.json; M .voder/history.md; M .voder/last-action.md).
- Commit history is present and readable: recent commits use conventional prefixes (chore:, docs:, ci:, feat:, fix:). Example recent commit: 'aaf71b7 chore: ignore transient audit and .voder artifacts in Prettier checks'.
- Automated commits are used: many recent commits are authored by 'voder-bot' according to git log output.
- Branching is active and sensible: current branch is fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage tracking origin; main and multiple cleanup/topic branches exist locally.
- Release tags exist: 'v1.0.0-complete' and 'v1.0.1' are present.
- .gitignore, .prettierignore and .voderignore exist and include appropriate patterns (node_modules/, dist/, coverage/, .voder/, audit artifacts, etc.).
- Pre-commit hook is configured (.husky/pre-commit) and runs format:check, lint:check and type-check.
- Large binary assets (fonts and .glb files under assets/) are committed directly in Git; git lfs is not available here and LFS is not configured, which can bloat repository history.
- CI/audit artifacts (audit.json, audit-summary.md) are present in the repo tree. These are typically generated artifacts and may clutter history if routinely committed.
- Secret-scan artifacts (repo-secrets-scan.txt and a redacted variant) exist showing scanning/remediation activity; recommend verifying history for any residual sensitive data.

**Next Steps:**
- Clean the working tree: if .voder files are transient, add .voder/ to .gitignore and remove tracked files with 'git rm --cached .voder/*', then commit; otherwise commit intended .voder changes to reach a clean state.
- Migrate large binaries to Git LFS or external storage/CDN. Audit repository size and consider migrating or pruning historical large files to reduce repo bloat.
- Avoid committing generated CI/audit artifacts (audit.json, audit-summary.md) unless required. Add them to .gitignore or configure CI to store artifacts externally rather than in Git.
- Run a secrets-in-history scan (git-secrets, truffleHog, or BFG) to confirm no sensitive data remains in history. If secrets are found, perform history rewrite remediation and rotate credentials.
- Document automated commit usage and commit author identity in CONTRIBUTING.md to clarify bot commits vs human commits and avoid mixed user.name/user.email confusion.
- Consider adding a LICENSE file and a CONTRIBUTING.md (if not present) to clarify licensing and repository workflow (branching, PR, tagging/release conventions).
