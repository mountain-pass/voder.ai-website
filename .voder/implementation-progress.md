Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 48.3

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (83.5% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The repository is in a strong, working state for a static pre-launch website: builds succeed, tests run, linting and formatting are enforced, and dependency/audit tooling is integrated. However several required thresholds are unmet (notably Security and some quality gates) and a few process/CI artifacts and gaps remain (limited end-to-end coverage, missing SAST/secret-scan automation, and some repository noise). Addressing these will move the project from 'near-complete' to production-ready.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Address security gaps first: add scheduled automated audits, secret scanning in CI, and integrate SAST/CodeQL or Semgrep along with an SBOM so high/critical risks are detected and remediated automatically.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- This is a small static pre-launch website whose core runtime functionality is implemented and covered by tests. The project has a clear main entry (src/main.ts -> src/app.ts), an index.html referencing the module, styling, and a focused test suite which runs successfully. There is no backend/API or CLI to evaluate; the repository appears functional for its stated purpose (a static pre-launch site) with automated tests green.
- Main entry points present: src/main.ts (boots app) and src/app.ts (init function that populates #app).
- index.html references /src/main.ts as the module entry and contains <div id="app"></div> for the app mount point.
- src/app.ts implements the core UI behavior: finds #app and injects the Voder HTML (heading, description, subtitle).
- CSS present at src/style.css providing layout and theme styling for rendered content.
- Test suite exists under tests/ and runs successfully: npm test completed with 4 test files, 14 tests passed (observed output).
- Automated tests cover important behaviors: rendering of content, main initialization under different document.readyState values, and various utility scripts (health-check-utils, prepare-libraries simulation).
- package.json provides standard scripts (dev, build, preview, test, lint, format, verify), dependencies (three, gsap, clarity) and devDependencies; Node engine is pinned to >=22.17.0.
- No server/API endpoints or CLI commands implemented beyond the Vite dev/build scripts — project is intentionally a static site.
- Git status shows local modified files in .voder metadata, but no recent commit history inspected beyond working tree status.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the dev server (npm run dev) and visually verify the site in a browser (http://localhost:5173) to smoke-test runtime assets (three.js/GSAP behavior if used).
- Add an npm run build check as part of assessment (npm run build) to confirm production bundling succeeds in this environment and that produced dist/ serves correctly via npm run preview.
- Add an end-to-end/browser test (Playwright or Cypress) to validate the actual DOM/CSS rendering and catch integration issues not covered by unit/jsdom tests.
- If intended to be a purely static site, consider documenting a minimal manual QA checklist in README (expected visual elements, supported browsers, performance/asset checks).
- If additional runtime features (APIs, CLI, interactivity) are planned, implement and add targeted tests (integration/API or CLI tests) so functionality can be validated automatically.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- High overall code quality: strong linting/formatting setup, tests pass, and code is well organized and consistent. Minor gaps are limited to a few linters/steps not executed during this assessment and the small surface area of code reviewed.
- ESLint is configured via eslint.config.ts and a comprehensive config under config/eslint (base, dx, performance). package.json exposes lint, lint:fix, and lint:check scripts.
- I executed the project's lint scripts (npm run lint and npm run lint:check). ESLint ran without reporting errors in this environment (no lint failures surfaced when running the project's lint scripts).
- Prettier configuration exists (prettier.config.ts). Running npm run format:check reported: 'All matched files use Prettier code style!'.
- TypeScript is used and configured (tsconfig.json and tsconfig.build.json). package.json includes a type-check script (tsc --noEmit) and the build script runs tsc -p before vite build.
- Unit tests are present and run successfully: npm test (Vitest) completed with 4 test files and 14 tests passing; the test suite is green.
- Project structure is clean and modular: src/ contains focused files (app.ts, main.ts, style.css); tests live in tests/; lint and tooling configs are in config/ — this separation aids maintainability.
- Naming is consistent and idiomatic (camelCase, descriptive function/file names). Examples: init(), parseVersion(), compareSemver(), checkLockfileAndNodeModules().
- Defensive checks and error handling are present where applicable: src/app.ts checks for the #app element and logs/returns early; health-check-utils handles invalid input by returning null and uses fs.existsSync safely.
- Additional style/markup tooling exists: stylelint.config.ts and htmlhint.config.js are present and scripts for linting CSS/HTML are in package.json (lint:css, lint:html), though they were not executed in this run.
- No significant code duplication observed in the small inspected codebase; the code is simple and focused which reduces complexity-related quality issues.

**Next Steps:**
- Add a CI job that runs the full quality pipeline on pull requests: npm run format:check, npm run lint:check, npm run lint:css, npm run lint:html, npm run type-check, npm run build, and npm test.
- Run and enforce type checking (npm run type-check) and build (npm run build) in CI to catch type or build-time issues not covered by tests.
- Execute CSS and HTML linters (npm run lint:css and npm run lint:html) in CI to validate styles and markup as part of automated checks.
- Consider enforcing eslint --max-warnings 0 (already present as lint:check) and failing CI on any warnings to keep the codebase strictly clean.
- Ensure a lockfile (package-lock.json / yarn.lock / pnpm-lock.yaml) is committed for reproducible installs if not intentionally omitted; health-check-utils references checking for package-lock.json.
- Add coverage thresholds or coverage reporting enforcement if coverage is important for the project to prevent regressions as the codebase grows.
- As the project grows, run duplication detectors and consider static-analysis/security scanners (Snyk, npm audit in CI) to catch emerging quality/security issues.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The project has a solid, working test suite with Vitest configured and tests that run locally with 100% coverage for the tested modules. Tests are present and exercised via npm scripts and vitest config; however the test surface is primarily unit-level/simulation-based, there are no visible end-to-end Playwright tests despite CI referencing them, and the repository's GitHub Actions history shows recent CI runs failing (needs investigation).
- Test files found in tests/: coverage-increase.test.ts, health-check-utils.test.ts, main.test.ts, prepare-libraries.test.ts and tests/setup.ts.
- Testing framework and tooling: vitest is configured (vitest.config.ts and config/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts); devDependencies include vitest, @testing-library/dom, @testing-library/jest-dom, jsdom/happy-dom, and related packages.
- NPM test scripts present: 'test', 'test:watch', 'test:coverage', 'test:ci' (package.json).
- I executed the test suite (npm run test:ci). Result: 14 tests passed (4 test files) and vitest reported coverage.
- Coverage output (from running tests): All files 100% statements/branches/functions/lines; app.ts and main.ts show 100% coverage.
- Coverage configuration: createVitestJsdomConfig sets coverage provider to 'v8', reporters (text, html, lcov) and default thresholds (90% for branches/functions/lines/statements) in config/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts.
- Tests are predominantly unit-level: DOM-based unit tests for app/main, pure-function tests for health-check-utils, and a simulated prepare-libraries test that exercises filesystem behaviors via a local simulation (not the real script side-effects).
- CI/workflow mismatch: .github/workflows/ci.yml references Playwright multi-browser tests and runs npm run test:ci and other verification steps, but there are no Playwright test files in the repo. get_github_pipeline_status shows recent CI workflow runs as 'failure' — test steps may be failing in CI or other verify steps (build/lint/format) are failing.
- Some tests mock/spy on Node fs APIs and document readiness; the suite resets DOM and module state between tests, which is good practice.
- No explicit e2e Playwright tests or Playwright config files detected despite CI referencing Playwright; no playwright.config.* or tests/e2e/ files found.

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate the failing GitHub Actions CI runs: download/inspect the workflow logs (especially test-ci.log, build.log, eslint.log) to determine whether tests are failing in CI or other verify steps are causing the job to fail.
- If CI is intended to run Playwright E2E tests, add Playwright configuration and e2e tests (or remove Playwright references from CI) to align CI with repository contents.
- Add at least one integration or end-to-end test to exercise real script behavior (for example run scripts/prepare-libraries.js in a temporary environment) rather than only simulation, to increase confidence in file-system side-effects.
- Consider adding CI step to publish coverage artifacts and enforce coverage thresholds (the config contains thresholds, ensure CI makes test failure on threshold breach explicit).
- Document how to run tests and interpret results in README or CONTRIBUTING to help contributors run and debug tests locally (include required Node version >=22.17.0 noted in package.json).
- If CI failures are due to environment differences (node version, missing browsers), make the CI environment reproduce the dev environment (install Playwright browsers if needed or skip Playwright step when none exist).

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Execution for this project is strong: the codebase builds successfully, tests pass, type-check/lint/format health checks pass, and production build artifacts are produced. The only notable execution issue is inability to verify the dev/preview server running in this environment (preview attempts could not be connected to), which prevents confirming a working local preview endpoint.
- Build succeeded: ran `npm run build` (which runs `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json && vite build`) and Vite produced a dist/ with index.html and assets (build completed without errors).
- Tests passed: ran `npm run test` (vitest) — 4 test files, 14 tests in total, all passed.
- Health checks passed: executed `node scripts/health-check.js` which ran the type-check (`tsc --noEmit`), eslint (lint:check), and prettier format check — all reported OK.
- Node engine requirement satisfied: package.json requires node >=22.17.0 and the runtime here is v22.17.1.
- package-lock.json is present and health-check verified node_modules exists (so dependencies appear installed in this environment).
- Build artifacts observed in dist/: dist/index.html and dist/assets/* (css/js) with small gzip sizes — indicates a working production build pipeline.
- Basic runtime behavior (app init) is testable and defensive: src/app.ts logs an error and returns early if #app element is missing; tests exercise init and verify DOM content.
- Preview/dev server could not be verified: `npm run preview` initially failed with a spawn ETIMEDOUT when invoked via run_command, and `curl http://localhost:5173` could not connect. A background start reported a PID but the server was not contactable from this environment. This prevents confirming that the preview server reliably serves the built site here.
- No runtime errors or warnings were observed in build/test/health-check outputs; logs produced by the commands executed were clean and showed success for the checked steps.

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate and fix the preview/server start reliability: try `npm run preview` locally and inspect the preview logs; run `vite preview --port 5173 --strictPort` directly to see errors if any. Ensure the preview server binds to localhost and the configured port is available.
- If CI or automated tooling needs to run the preview, add explicit logging and an exit-on-failure behavior for the preview script so automation can detect and report failures early.
- Add or document a reproducible local development/run guide in README (explicit commands, required Node version, how to run preview and which port to expect) so contributors can reliably run the app.
- Consider adding an automated smoke test in CI that starts the preview server and probes the expected URL (e.g., headless browser or HTTP check) to confirm the built site is actually being served.
- If preview intermittently fails in certain environments, capture server stdout/stderr to a log file during startup (or run with --debug) to gather diagnostic info (binding errors, port conflicts, permission issues).

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (80% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is well-organized and developer-focused: there is a clear README with setup/usage, a Developer Setup guide, ADRs (architecture decision records), a libraries reference, CI notes and a SECURITY.md. Tests run successfully which supports correctness of the documented commands. Gaps: no changelog or release notes, no API reference (if one is applicable), no CONTRIBUTING.md, no LICENSE file, and minimal inline docstrings/JSDoc in source code.
- README.md exists and contains clear quick-start/setup/run/build/test/lint instructions (commands match package.json scripts).
- docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md present and documents a reproducible verification sequence (type-check, lint, format, build, tests) that aligns with CI and package.json scripts.
- An organized docs/ directory exists with a 'decisions' folder containing many accepted ADRs (e.g. docs/decisions/0001-... ), and a docs/libraries/ folder with multiple dependency notes (helpful architectural and dependency documentation).
- SECURITY.md is present with triage guidance and links to audit artifacts (audit.json, audit-summary.md).
- Package.json provides scripts for docs setup (docs:setup, docs:report), verification (verify), linting, testing and health-check; these are documented in README and DEVELOPER-SETUP.
- Automated tests exist (tests/*.ts). I ran npm test and all tests passed locally: 4 test files, 14 tests passed.
- No explicit API documentation found (searches did not reveal an API reference or OpenAPI/Swagger files) — likely acceptable for a small static site but is a missing artefact if any public API exists.
- No CHANGELOG.md or other release notes were found in the repository (searches for changelog returned no matches).
- No CONTRIBUTING.md found to guide external contributors on workflow, branching, PR expectations, or code ownership.
- Source code has minimal inline comments; there are single-line comments in src/app.ts and src/main.ts but no JSDoc-style docstrings or richer API-level documentation for exported functions.
- No LICENSE file in repository root; package.json sets license to 'UNLICENSED'.

**Next Steps:**
- Add a CHANGELOG.md or link to GitHub releases and document the release process (semantic versioning and changelog generation).
- If the project exposes any public APIs, add an API reference (OpenAPI/Swagger or human-readable API docs) or explicitly document that there is no public API to avoid confusion.
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md to explain how to open issues/PRs, coding style, review expectations, and branch/release workflow for external contributors.
- Add a LICENSE file (if intended to be open source) or clearly document licensing in the repo root to remove ambiguity.
- Improve inline documentation: add JSDoc/type comments to public functions and modules (e.g., exported init function) so IDEs and generated docs can surface helpful info.
- Consider a small architectural overview (top-level docs/ARCHITECTURE.md or extend README) summarizing high-level structure and design rationale, linking to ADRs.
- Document the docs generation workflow (what docs:setup does and how to publish docs, if relevant) so contributors know how to update/preview docs.
- Establish a release checklist that includes updating docs, changelog, and release notes so documentation stays in sync with code changes.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (90% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Dependency management is well-established: a package manifest and lockfile are present, npm ci reproducibly installs packages, audit artifacts show zero vulnerabilities, and top-level dependencies are declared. Some small improvement opportunities remain (automated update tooling, regular outdated checks, CI policy tweaks).
- package.json is present and well-formed with explicit dependencies and devDependencies (examples: prod deps -> @microsoft/clarity ^1.0.0, gsap ^3.13.0, three ^0.180.0; many devDeps for testing/linting/build).
- A lockfile exists on disk (package-lock.json) and npm ci used it to install packages: npm ci output shows "added 662 packages, and audited 686 packages" and the prepare script ran successfully.
- npm audit --json (and audit.json in the repo) reports zero vulnerabilities (critical/high/moderate/low all 0). audit-summary.md and ci-audit-summary.md also reflect no high/critical findings.
- npm ls --depth=0 --json shows installed top-level packages and versions that correspond to package.json (e.g., gsap 3.13.0, three 0.180.0, vite 7.1.5, typescript 5.9.2, vitest 3.2.4).
- The repository includes scripts for dependency-related maintenance: scripts/prepare-libraries.js (prepares README links from node_modules), 'audit:fix' and 'security:local' npm scripts, and README documents using npm ci for reproducible installs.
- I attempted to run npm outdated but the command failed in this environment (stderr N/A). I spot-checked a few top-level packages via npm view (gsap -> 3.13.0, three -> 0.180.0) and they match the declared versions.
- node engine requirement is declared in package.json (node >=22.17.0), which ensures a consistent runtime for native/build tooling but may be restrictive for some contributors using older Node versions.

**Next Steps:**
- Add automated dependency update tooling (Dependabot or Renovate) to open PRs for minor/patch updates and surface higher-risk upgrades.
- Ensure a regular 'npm outdated' run in CI (or as a scheduled job) so maintainers can proactively track outdated packages; fix the environment issue causing 'npm outdated' to fail in this workspace.
- Continue running npm audit in CI and consider failing CI on newly introduced high/critical vulnerabilities (or gate PRs accordingly); the repo already has audit.json/audit-summary artifacts—wire this into CI if not already enforced.
- Consider adopting automated SCA providers (Snyk/OSS Index/GitHub Advanced Security) for deeper transitive-vulnerability and license analysis.
- Decide and document a dependency pinning/updating policy for production dependencies (e.g., lockfile maintenance strategy, frequency of dependency bumps, and testing requirements for upgrades).
- Verify that package-lock.json is committed and used in repository CI (README suggests npm ci is expected); if not committed, commit the lockfile to ensure reproducible installs.
- Periodically review devDependencies and remove unused ones to reduce attack surface and maintenance burden.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (75% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- The project has good basic security hygiene for a static site: automated npm-audit integration, an audit parser that fails on high/critical advisories, CI verification steps, pre-commit quality checks, and no hardcoded secrets detected in the repository. However, it lacks several additional automated supply-chain and code-security controls (SAST/CodeQL, automated dependency updates, secret-scanning in CI, SBOM/manifest, container/deployment security guidance), so there are gaps that should be addressed to reach production-ready security posture.
- npm audit artifacts present and clean: audit.json (empty vulnerabilities) and audit-summary.md show 0 critical/high/moderate/low/info (files: audit.json, audit-summary.md).
- Local npm audit run reproduced the same result (npm audit --json returned zero vulnerabilities).
- GitHub Actions security workflow exists: .github/workflows/security-audit.yml runs npm audit, captures audit.json, and uses .github/scripts/parse-audit.js to fail on high/critical advisories.
- Audit parser script enforces failure when high or critical vulnerabilities are present (file: .github/scripts/parse-audit.js).
- Project scripts include security helpers: package.json includes 'security:local', 'audit:fix', and a 'verify' sequence that calls audit:fix before other checks.
- Pre-commit hooks enforce quality gates: .husky/pre-commit runs format:check, lint:check, and type-check to prevent low-quality commits from proceeding.
- No hardcoded secrets detected by repository search and grep scan; repo-secrets-scan.* files exist but are empty (repo-secrets-scan.txt / repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt), and automated search for common key patterns returned no matches.
- CI uses GitHub Secrets for at least one env var (VITE_SENTRY_DSN referenced in .github/workflows/ci.yml) — secrets are not stored in plaintext in the repo.
- There is no CodeQL or other SAST scanning workflow present (.github/workflows contains only ci.yml and security-audit.yml), and I did not find dependabot/renovate config for automatic dependency updates.
- No explicit secret-scanning job in CI visible (the repo contains static secret-scan artifacts but no automated scanner step in the workflows).
- No SBOM, license or supply-chain provenance artifacts discovered and no Dockerfile or deployment configuration to verify HTTPS/encryption or container hardening settings (project is a static front-end site).

**Next Steps:**
- Add automated dependency update bot (Dependabot or Renovate) to proactively propose dependency updates and reduce drift.
- Add secret scanning to CI (e.g., GitHub Advanced Security secret scanning if available, or an open-source scanner like truffleHog/git-secrets) to catch secrets early and fail PRs containing them.
- Add SAST/CodeQL or other static-analysis security scanning to CI to catch code patterns that may be risky (even for front-end code).
- Ensure npm audit runs on pull requests (not only on main push) and add an automated schedule for periodic audits; consider failing PRs on newly introduced high/critical vulnerabilities.
- Introduce SBOM generation (e.g., cyclonedx or SPDX) and store artifacts in CI run outputs to support incident response and supply-chain analysis.
- Add dependency pinning / lockfile policy checks and consider publishing an automated vulnerability-monitoring alerting (e.g., GitHub Dependabot alerts, Snyk) for continuous monitoring.
- Add an automated secret-scan pre-commit hook (git-secrets or husky integrated scan) to prevent accidental secrets in commits; retain the existing pre-commit quality checks.
- If this project is deployed, add deployment configuration documenting HTTPS enforcement, CSP (Content Security Policy), and other runtime security headers; add tests for these headers where applicable.
- Consider adding a documented release/incident response procedure in SECURITY.md (rotate keys, how to report issues, contact information) and enable branch protections that require the security/CI checks to pass before merging.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (80% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Overall the repository shows a healthy git history with clear, conventional commit messages, an appropriate .gitignore, tracked lockfile, and active branches. Issues lowering the score: the working directory currently has modified/transient .voder files (uncommitted changes), and some agent/CI artifacts (logs / parse outputs / transient files) appear to have been added to the repo historically — these are undesirable if they are ephemeral. Branching and recent activity are active and descriptive.
- Git branch: currently on fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage (git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD). Branch is ahead of origin by 1 as reported by git status --porcelain -b.
- Recent commit history (git log -n 20) uses clear, conventional-style messages (examples: "chore(ci): capture npm ci and audit parse artifacts", "ci(security): upload audit artifacts and run parser safely", "docs: add Developer Setup & Verification guide").
- Working directory is not fully clean: git status shows modified files in .voder/ (.voder/history.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/.processes.json). These appear to be transient/agent artifacts.
- .gitignore exists and is comprehensive (node_modules, dist, coverage, logs, env files, etc.).
- Important files are tracked: package-lock.json, audit.json, ci-audit.json, audit-summary.md and ci-audit-summary.md are present and tracked (git ls-files showed them). The presence of package-lock.json supports reproducible installs.
- Pre-commit hooks are configured (.husky/pre-commit) to run format:check, lint:check and type-check — good quality gate integration.
- Branch structure appears reasonable with a main branch and several feature/fix/cleanup branches. Recent activity is frequent and appropriately scoped.
- Some commits and operations indicate that log/artifact files and agent-generated files were added/committed (e.g., audit artifacts and some .voder files). Committing such transient files can clutter history and is typically undesirable.

**Next Steps:**
- Decide policy for transient/agent files (.voder/). If they should be ignored, add .voder/ to .gitignore (or .voderignore) and remove currently tracked .voder files from the index with git rm --cached <file> and commit that change.
- Clean up working directory: either commit intended changes to .voder files (if necessary) or discard/unstage them so the working tree is clean before further work or merging.
- Review and consider removing committed ephemeral logs/artifacts (audit-parse.log, npm-ci.log, etc.) from the repository history (git rm + commit), or move them to CI artifact uploads rather than the repo root. If you must keep snapshots, consider storing them in a designated folder and documenting why they are tracked.
- Add a short CONTRIBUTING or developer note describing what should/should not be committed (lockfile and audit summaries ok; CI logs and agent transient files should not be).
- Consider enabling branch protection rules on main (and/or trunk) and a structured release/tagging process if not already configured to enforce stable history and PR reviews.
- Optionally: add lightweight tags for releases or important checkpoints and consider running a small git history cleanup (squash/fixup) for any noisy commits before merging long-lived branches to main.
