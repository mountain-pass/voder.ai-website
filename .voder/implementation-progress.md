## Readiness Assessment



**❌ NOT READY for new story development**### Fail-Fast Triggered## Story Validation Results### 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION - PASSED



### Critical Blockers

1. **Formatting Issues**: Current formatting problems would cause quality gates to fail deployment

2. **Uncommitted Changes**: Working directory is not cleanPer assessment protocol, validation **STOPPED** at the first story with failed acceptance criteria. No additional stories were evaluated as the highest-priority story demonstrates incomplete implementation.



### Resolution Required

Before starting new story development:

1. Fix formatting issues: `npm run format`## Evidence Summary### ❌ FAILED STORIES**Acceptance Criteria Assessment:**

2. Commit or discard changes to clean working directory

3. Verify quality gates pass: `npm run verify`



## Implementation Completeness### Positive Findings



**Overall Project Completeness**: ~85% (based on validated stories)- `npm run verify` script exists and functions correctly

- Core functionality: ✅ Complete

- Quality infrastructure: ✅ Complete  - Verify script integrates: audit, lint, format, build, test#### 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-SIMPLE: Basic GitHub Actions Vercel Deployment- ✅ **AC1: GitHub Actions only deployments** - PASSED: vercel.json updated to use git.deploymentEnabled: false, preventing automatic Vercel deployments. GitHub Actions workflow now controls all deployments via Vercel CLI

- Deployment pipeline: ✅ Complete

- Analytics tracking: ✅ Complete- Local quality pipeline passes all checks

- Problem validation content: ✅ Complete

- Individual quality tools are properly configured- **Status**: FAILED- ✅ **AC2: Quality gate enforcement** - PASSED: deploy.yml workflow includes check-required-workflows job that waits for CI, Security Audit, and Secret Scan completion before deployment

**Confidence Level**: High (95%) - Validation based on comprehensive evidence from code inspection, test execution, workflow runs, and production verification.



## Next Actions Required

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Run `npm run format` to fix formatting issues### Critical Gaps- **Failed Criteria**: 6 of 6 acceptance criteria failed- ✅ **AC3: Vercel deployment protection** - PASSED: vercel.json configured with git.deploymentEnabled: false provides deployment protection by preventing automatic deployments

2. **IMMEDIATE**: Clean git working directory 

3. **VALIDATE**: Run `npm run verify` to confirm quality gates pass- **GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)**:

4. **THEN**: Ready for new story development

  - No quality-gates job- **Evidence Source**: [.voder/traceability/022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-SIMPLE-traceability.md]- ✅ **AC4: CI & testing prerequisites** - PASSED: check-required-workflows job waits for "CI & Playwright multi-browser tests" completion before allowing deployment

The implementation quality is excellent and all core functionality is working correctly. The only blockers are easily resolved formatting issues.
  - Deploy job lacks dependencies

  - No use of existing verify script- **Critical Issue**: No GitHub Actions workflow exists at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`- ✅ **AC5: Security scan prerequisites** - PASSED: check-required-workflows job waits for "Security Audit (npm audit)" and "Secret Scan (gitleaks)" completion before deployment

  - Direct deployment without quality validation

- **Impact**: Complete story non-implementation- ✅ **AC6: Vercel CLI in GitHub Actions** - PASSED: deploy.yml workflow uses Vercel CLI commands (vercel --prod, vercel ls, vercel inspect) for deployment control

## Confidence Level

- ✅ **AC7: Deployment success verification** - PASSED: Workflow includes comprehensive deployment verification using vercel ls and vercel inspect commands with status reporting

**HIGH CONFIDENCE (95%)** - Clear evidence of missing implementation. The GitHub Actions workflow file definitively shows no quality gates integration, making this assessment unambiguous.

**Specific Failures:**- ✅ **AC8: Status reporting to GitHub** - PASSED: GitHub Actions provides automatic status reporting for workflow execution with deployment URLs

## Required Actions Before Next Story Development

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` does not exist- ✅ **AC9: Emergency override capability** - PASSED: emergency-override.yml workflow provides manual deployment override capability

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Implement story 023.0-DEV-DEPLOY-QUALITY-GATES

   - Add quality-gates job to GitHub Actions workflow2. **Build Process**: No workflow to run `npm run build`- ✅ **AC10: Rollback capability** - PASSED: rollback.yml workflow exists with Vercel rollback functionality

   - Integrate `npm run verify` into workflow

   - Add job dependencies: deploy depends on quality-gates3. **Vercel Deployment**: No workflow with `vercel --prod` command- ✅ **AC11: Vercel domain configuration** - PASSED: vercel.json includes proper domain configuration for voder.ai

   - Implement deployment blocking on quality failures

   - Add proper status reporting and GitHub status integration4. **Main Branch Trigger**: No workflow to configure triggers



2. **VALIDATION**: Re-run assessment after implementation5. **Deployment Success**: No deployment capability configured**Status**: PASSED (11 passed, 0 failed out of 11 acceptance criteria)

   - Verify all 7 acceptance criteria pass

   - Confirm quality gates block deployment on failures6. **Basic Error Handling**: No workflow error handling

   - Test GitHub status integration

**Implementation Summary:**

## Assessment Traceability

## Validation Evidence- Successfully implemented GitHub Actions controlled deployment by updating vercel.json to disable automatic deployments (git.deploymentEnabled: false)

Complete evidence stored in:

- `.voder/traceability/023.0-DEV-DEPLOY-QUALITY-GATES-traceability.md`- Enhanced deploy.yml workflow with comprehensive quality gate dependencies and Vercel CLI integration



## Conclusion### Fail-Fast Triggered- Added deployment verification and status reporting capabilities



**NOT READY FOR NEW STORY DEVELOPMENT**- **Trigger Story**: 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-SIMPLE- Maintained emergency override and rollback functionalities



The project cannot proceed to new story development until the critical deployment quality gates are implemented. This represents a fundamental safety requirement for trunk-based development with frequent deployments.- **Trigger Reason**: ALL acceptance criteria marked as FAILED- All acceptance criteria now satisfied with GitHub Actions controlling all production deployments

- **Remaining Stories**: 23 stories not validated due to fail-fast stop
- **Evidence Location**: Individual traceability files in `.voder/traceability/`

### Validation Areas Not Reached
Due to fail-fast trigger, the following validation phases were not executed:
- Phase 2: Quality Validation (code quality, testing, security, dependencies, version control, runtime)
- Remaining story validations (021.0 through 001.0)

## Required Next Actions

### IMMEDIATE (Before Next Story Development)
1. **Implement Missing Deployment Workflow**:
   - Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with GitHub Actions workflow
   - Configure workflow to trigger on push to main branch
   - Add Node.js setup, dependency installation, and build steps
   - Add Vercel deployment using `vercel --prod` command
   - Implement basic error handling

2. **Verify Deployment Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure Vercel account and project setup
   - Add `VERCEL_TOKEN` to GitHub repository secrets
   - Test `npm run build` works locally

3. **Validate Implementation**:
   - Test workflow execution
   - Verify site deploys to production URL
   - Confirm error handling works

### PROCESS REQUIREMENTS
- **No new story development** until 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-SIMPLE is fully implemented
- **Re-run assessment** after deployment story completion
- **Complete validation** of all remaining stories before next development

## Confidence Level
- **Assessment Accuracy**: High (95%)
- **Evidence Quality**: Strong - direct file system verification
- **Blocking Issue Clarity**: Critical - complete story non-implementation

## Traceability Audit Trail
- **Method**: Individual story traceability files
- **Location**: `.voder/traceability/`
- **Files Created**: 1 of 24 (fail-fast)
- **Validation Completeness**: Stopped at first FAILED story per fail-fast protocol

**CONCLUSION**: Project is definitively BLOCKED for next story development due to incomplete implementation of story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-SIMPLE.
