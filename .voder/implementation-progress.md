Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (82.25% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The repository is well-structured, with strong code quality, documentation, dependency hygiene, and security practices. The main blocking issue is the testing/e2e pipeline: Playwright e2e runs and artifact generation are unstable in CI, producing zero-count stability summaries or missing artifacts. Until the e2e orchestration and artifact upload are made reliable (so e2e-stability.json reliably contains either real stats or a clear 'reason'), the overall implementation must be considered incomplete despite otherwise solid engineering hygiene.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Make the e2e orchestration reliable in CI: ensure the job that runs scripts/run-e2e.sh also runs the generator and unconditionally uploads playwright-results.json, preview.out, test-results/** and a canonical e2e-stability.json (with a top-level "reason" when tests did not run), then add the quick node scripts/check-e2e-artifacts.js verifier to fail fast and surface preview.out for debugging.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- This is a small static pre-launch website with a clear main entrypoint, rendering logic, styles, and a comprehensive test suite that runs successfully. Core functionality (rendering the app into #app, dev/build/test scripts, and several maintenance scripts) is implemented and verified by unit and integration-style tests. There are no server/API or CLI components to evaluate; e2e Playwright tests exist but require running a dev/preview server to execute in a browser environment.
- Main entry point exists: src/main.ts imports ./app.js and ./style.css and initializes the app on DOMContentLoaded or immediately.
- Core rendering logic implemented in src/app.ts: init() finds #app and injects the page HTML (heading, subtitle, copy).
- Styling is present in src/style.css and index.html references src/main.ts via a module script.
- package.json includes standard scripts: dev (vite), build (tsc + vite build), preview (vite preview), test (vitest), and e2e/test-related scripts.
- Tests run successfully: I executed npm run test and Vitest ran 4 test files (14 tests) — all passed.
- Health-check and utility scripts are implemented and have unit tests (e.g., scripts/health-check-utils.js has tests for parseVersion/compareSemver/checkLockfileAndNodeModules).
- Playwright e2e test exists (tests/e2e/app.spec.ts) that checks page loads and title, but it requires a running server (dev/preview) or CI setup to execute; I did not run the e2e Playwright test against a live server.
- No backend API endpoints or CLI tools are present in the repository — the project is a static frontend site as described in README.
- node and toolchain constraints are explicit (package.json requires Node >=22.17.0). The environment used to run tests satisfied this (node v22.17.1).

**Next Steps:**
- Smoke-test the running site in a browser: run npm run dev and open http://localhost:5173 to verify the visual output and console logs in a real browser.
- Run a production build and preview: npm run build && npm run preview to confirm the build pipeline produces a working dist/ artifact.
- Execute Playwright e2e tests against the running preview server (start server, then run the e2e:ci command) to validate end-to-end behavior in a real browser environment.
- Add or verify CI steps that run build + e2e tests so regressions in runtime behavior are caught automatically.
- If broader functionality is planned (APIs, forms, user interactions), add integration tests and example usage for those features; currently the project implements only a static landing page.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The repository demonstrates a well-configured code-quality toolchain and good hygiene: ESLint (flat config), Prettier, stylelint, htmlhint, Husky pre-commit hooks, a verify script, and a test suite with full coverage for the small app. Linters run successfully and tests pass. The only concrete issue found is a Prettier formatting mismatch on a non-source JSON file (e2e-stability.json) reported by format:check — otherwise source files are lint/format compliant. Overall the project is high quality with only minor housekeeping to reach near-production polish.
- ESLint configured via eslint.config.ts and a layered config under config/eslint (base.ts, dx.ts, performance.ts). The project uses the ESLint flat config approach (no .eslintrc required).
- Prettier configuration present (prettier.config.ts). 'npm run format' successfully runs Prettier; 'npm run format:check' reported formatting issues for e2e-stability.json (non-source file).
- stylelint configuration exists (stylelint.config.ts) and stylelint runs (npm run lint:css) without errors.
- htmlhint is configured (htmlhint.config.js) and 'npm run lint:html' reported no errors.
- Husky pre-commit hook exists (.husky/pre-commit) running format:check, lint:check and type-check, enforcing checks locally.
- npm scripts provide lint, lint:fix, lint:check, format, format:check, type-check, verify (a composite CI-local verification script).
- Tests: Vitest suite runs and all tests passed (14 tests). 'npm run test:coverage' reports 100% coverage for app.ts and main.ts in this small codebase.
- Running lint commands (npm run lint and npm run lint:check) produced no lint errors for the checked files.
- Source layout is simple and well-organized: src/ contains app.ts, main.ts, style.css; config/ contains structured linting and testing config. Naming conventions are consistent and readable.
- Error handling is basic but present (e.g., app.init logs console.error if #app element not found). Scripts under scripts/ are small and test-covered (health-check-utils.js has tests).

**Next Steps:**
- Fix the Prettier formatting mismatch (e2e-stability.json) so format:check passes consistently in pre-commit and CI. Either reformat that file or exclude it from Prettier checks if intentional.
- Consider tightening some ESLint rules over time (e.g., re-enable stricter TypeScript rules like '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any' where feasible) to prevent permissive patterns creeping in.
- Ensure CI runs the verify script (or equivalent subset) so lint:check, format:check and type-check are enforced on every PR/merge, preventing regressions.
- Add more targeted unit tests around runtime behavior and scripts to increase confidence beyond the small current surface area (scripts/prepare-libraries.js, health-check.js, etc.).
- Audit lint rule differences (base/dx/performance layers) and document any intentional relaxations (for example 'no-var' is turned off) to make onboarding and reviews easier.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (50% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Unit/unit-like tests (Vitest) are present and pass locally with full coverage for core files, and testing infrastructure for e2e (Playwright) exists — however the repository's e2e pipeline is failing in CI repeatedly. Because CI test runs (e2e) are failing, overall testing quality is considered unstable and score is reduced.
- Test framework: Vitest is configured and used (package.json scripts: test, test:coverage, test:ci; devDependency vitest present).
- Unit/test files found: tests/*.test.ts (coverage-increase.test.ts, health-check-utils.test.ts, main.test.ts, prepare-libraries.test.ts) — 4 test files, 14 tests.
- Test setup exists: tests/setup.ts imports @testing-library/jest-dom and clears DOM between tests.
- Local test run (npm test) succeeded: 4 test files, 14/14 tests passed.
- Coverage run (npm run test:coverage) produced 100% coverage for app.ts and main.ts (v8 provider) and overall coverage reported 100% for the tested files.
- Vitest config excludes e2e tests from unit test runs (vitest.config.ts excludes tests/e2e/**).
- Playwright e2e present: tests/e2e/app.spec.ts and playwright config/playwright-results.json exist; package.json contains @playwright/test and a script e2e:ci (npx playwright test --reporter=json --output=test-results/).
- CI evidence of failures: GitHub Actions workflow .github/workflows/e2e-stability.yml shows repeated recent failures in the last 10 runs — indicates CI e2e stability problems (pipeline status retrieved).
- I did not run Playwright e2e tests here; local vitest unit tests were run and passed. The failing CI e2e pipeline is the main blocker to declaring testing stable.

**Next Steps:**
- Reproduce the failing CI workflow locally: run the e2e suite and CI workflow steps. Commands to try: npm run e2e:ci and npx playwright test --reporter=list --debug to observe failures interactively.
- Inspect CI logs/artifacts for the failing .github/workflows/e2e-stability.yml runs (screenshots, traces, playwright JSON output) to identify why e2e tests fail in CI (environment, server not started, timeouts, baseUrl misconfiguration).
- Ensure e2e tests start a deterministic local server in CI or use Playwright's 'webServer' option so pages are available when tests run. Add wait/health-checks before running Playwright tests.
- Stabilize flaky e2e tests: add retries or increased timeouts temporarily, capture traces/screenshots, and fix race conditions in app startup or tests. Mark legitimately flaky tests with annotations until fixed.
- Add CI artifacts and failure diagnostics: upload Playwright traces, screenshots, and raw test JSON for failed runs to make debugging easier.
- Consider adding a gating policy so failing e2e CI does not get ignored (e.g., require green e2e workflow for merges) once tests are fixed; also add coverage thresholds to vitest config or CI to prevent regressions.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (86% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- Execution quality is strong: the project builds successfully, the test suite runs and passes, and the production build is produced and served by the preview command. Minor execution/environment issues (preview server port variations and an environment timeout when attempting to curl the preview) and a small surface area of runtime code limit the score.
- Unit tests: npm run test executed Vitest — 4 test files, 14 tests all passed (see test output: "4 passed (4)" / "14 passed (14)").
- Build: npm run build succeeded (tsc + vite) and produced dist artifacts (dist/index.html and assets). Vite build log: "✓ built in 228ms" and lists dist files.
- Preview / runtime server: preview.out shows the preview server started and served locally: "Local: http://localhost:4176/" (Vite attempted ports 4173-4175 then used 4176).
- Preview invocation from this environment: an attempt to start/preview hit a spawnSync ETIMEDOUT on one run and a curl to localhost:5173 failed (network/connectivity in this execution environment). Despite that, background vite preview processes were observed in ps output and preview.out indicates a running preview on 4176.
- Runtime checks / error handling: src/app.ts includes defensive checks (logs error and returns if #app missing). scripts/health-check-utils.js handles invalid inputs (returns null) and checks for lockfile + node_modules robustly.
- Tests exercise both DOM initialization (tests/main.test.ts) and utility scripts (tests/health-check-utils.test.ts, tests/prepare-libraries.test.ts). Tests avoid writing repo files and use temporary directories when needed.
- package.json declares Node engine >=22.17.0 and has a comprehensive set of scripts for dev, build, preview, test, lint, and verify.
- No runtime exceptions or failing tests were observed in the logs produced by build and test runs.

**Next Steps:**
- Locally verify the preview server by running npm run preview and opening the reported Local URL (e.g., http://localhost:4176/) — the remote execution environment prevented curl from connecting here.
- Add an automated smoke test (e.g., Playwright or simple HTTP check) that runs after npm run build to confirm preview serves the built assets on CI and catch port selection issues.
- Ensure CI runs the verify script (or equivalent steps) so build + tests + lint + format checks are validated in CI (package.json already contains a verify script).
- Consider making the preview port deterministic (or documenting expected behavior) or add a small script that writes the chosen preview URL to a known file for automated checks.
- Extend runtime integration tests where feasible (headless browser tests) to validate the built site in a browser environment and catch runtime regressions.
- Document any required runtime environment constraints (Node version, ports) in README or CI config to reduce developer setup friction.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Documentation coverage is high for developer onboarding and design rationale (README, developer setup, ADRs, library notes, security). Minor gaps remain: no changelog/release notes, an empty E2E reproduction doc, no CONTRIBUTING file, and no formal API/reference docs or generated API site. Overall the docs are well organized and practical for contributors, with a few recommended additions to reach production-grade completeness.
- README.md exists at repository root and contains a clear Quick start (prereqs, install, run, build, test, lint/format commands) and guidance for contributors (file: README.md).
- Developer onboarding: docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md provides an explicit, non-interactive verification sequence (type-check, lint, format, build, tests) and troubleshooting notes.
- Architectural documentation: docs/decisions/ contains many Markdown Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) (e.g. 0000-0024 accepted ADRs) documenting design choices and rationale.
- Per-library guidance: docs/libraries/ contains many package/library-specific Markdown notes (examples: vite.md, vitest.md, typescript.md, eslint.md, three.md, etc.).
- Security and audit docs: SECURITY.md exists with triage guidance; audit-summary.md and related audit artifacts are present (audit-summary.md, ci-audit-summary.md, audit.json files in repo).
- CI and workflow documentation exists in .github/workflows/ (CI, security-audit, secret-scan, code-scanning), indicating CI processes are documented via workflows.
- Scripts & docs tooling: package.json exposes docs:setup and docs:report scripts and a verify script that matches README and docs guidance, showing alignment between docs and tooling (package.json).
- Tests run successfully locally: executing npm test ran Vitest and all tests passed (4 test files, 14 tests passed). This indicates the docs' verification steps are accurate and up-to-date with the codebase.
- Source code has small inline comments (src/app.ts and src/main.ts include brief comments), but there are no JSDoc/TypeDoc-style API comments or a generated API reference site.
- CHANGELOG.md does not exist in the repository root (check returned missing).
- docs/E2E-REPRO.md is present but empty (no content).
- No CONTRIBUTING.md or CONTRIBUTING guide was found (search returned none).
- No formal API reference documentation or generated docs (e.g., TypeDoc, JSDoc site) were found in the repo; no typedoc config or docs site generator detected.

**Next Steps:**
- Add a changelog/release notes file (CHANGELOG.md) and document release process (how releases are cut, versioning policy).
- Populate docs/E2E-REPRO.md with reproducible steps to run/end-to-end tests locally (playwright instructions, expected artifacts, how to interpret results).
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md with PR, code review, branching and commit message guidance (link to developer setup and verify steps).
- Consider adding a formal API/reference doc (TypeDoc or JSDoc) if the project surface grows; add generated docs to /docs or GitHub Pages and include generation instructions in README.
- Introduce JSDoc/TypeDoc comments for public modules/APIs and a docs generation step (docs:setup) that produces an API reference so consumers and maintainers can quickly find runtime APIs.
- Link ADR index and important docs from the README (short summary and pointer to docs/decisions and docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md) to improve discoverability for new contributors.
- Add a short release checklist or CI step that ensures CHANGELOG and release notes are updated during release PRs (can be a PR template or CI job).
- If you want stricter guarantees about documentation freshness: add a docs lint step (markdownlint) to CI and require docs coverage as part of the verify script or PR checklist.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are declared and locked, node_modules is present, and automated audit reports show no known vulnerabilities. The repository includes audit outputs and scripts to run audits and health checks. Minor issues: I could not run an automated outdated-check in this environment, and I found no code references to the three declared production packages (possible unused deps).
- package.json exists and lists runtime dependencies: @microsoft/clarity ^1.0.0, gsap ^3.13.0, three ^0.180.0 and a comprehensive set of devDependencies (eslint, vitest, typescript, vite, etc.).
- A package-lock.json file is present in the repo root (lockfile available for reproducible installs).
- node_modules directory exists (dependencies are installed in this environment).
- npm audit --json (and audit.json / ci-audit.json files in repo) report zero vulnerabilities (audit.json and ci-audit.json both show 0 critical/high/moderate/low).
- npm ls --depth=0 --json was run and returned the top-level installed package list and versions (confirming installed versions match package.json/devDeps).
- npm ci --ignore-scripts ran successfully in this environment and reported 'found 0 vulnerabilities' after installing packages.
- Attempt to run 'npm outdated' in this environment failed (command returned an error), so I could not produce an automated list of outdated packages here.
- A code search for usages of the declared runtime packages (three, gsap, @microsoft/clarity) did not find any imports/usages in project source files (possible unused production dependencies; evidence: grep returned no matches in source).
- Project includes scripts and tooling to manage dependencies and checks: npm scripts for audit, audit:fix, security:local, health-check, and verify which runs an audit fix + lint/format/build/tests sequence.

**Next Steps:**
- Run 'npm outdated' locally or in CI to produce a list of outdated packages and consider updating non-breaking/minor patches. If network errors or CI restrictions prevented 'npm outdated' earlier, fix the environment or run locally.
- Run a dependency-usage check (e.g., depcheck or manually inspect) to confirm whether @microsoft/clarity, gsap, and three are actually used; remove or defer unused runtime dependencies to reduce attack surface and install size.
- Enable an automated dependency-update/monitoring tool (Dependabot or Renovate) in the repo so PRs are opened for new patch/minor/major releases and security fixes.
- Continue running 'npm audit' in CI on each commit; ensure audit JSON output is stored/parsed and failing the pipeline on new high/critical vulnerabilities as appropriate.
- Periodically run 'npm ci' in CI for reproducible installs and ensure package-lock.json remains committed and up-to-date after intentional dependency updates.
- Consider adding 'npm outdated --json' to CI or a local maintenance script and capture its output so maintainers can triage upgrades regularly.
- If unused devDependencies are present, prune or consolidate tooling to reduce maintenance burden; consider pinning critical runtime deps if you require stricter reproducibility beyond the lockfile.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (88% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The project shows a strong security posture for a frontend repository: automated security workflows are present (npm audit, secret scanning with gitleaks, CodeQL), npm audit artifacts indicate no current vulnerabilities, and there are no obvious hard-coded secrets in the repository snapshot. A few practical improvements (lockfile presence/verification, enforcement of CodeQL/Dependabot results, artifact handling) would raise this toward production-ready status.
- Automated security scans exist as GitHub Actions workflows (.github/workflows/security-audit.yml, .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml, .github/workflows/code-scanning.yml). These run scheduled daily and on push/PR.
- security-audit.yml runs npm audit and generates audit.json and audit-summary.md; audit-summary.md reports 0 critical/high/moderate/low/info issues and audit.json metadata lists 0 vulnerabilities.
- .github/scripts/parse-audit.js is present and enforces failing on any high/critical advisories (evidence of automation to block high-risk deps).
- Secret scanning configured via .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml using zricethezav/gitleaks-action with --redact and a step to fail if secrets are detected; artifacts (repo-secrets-scan.json and repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt) are uploaded for triage.
- CodeQL is configured (.github/workflows/code-scanning.yml) for TypeScript/JavaScript analysis and uploads SARIF as an artifact (codeql-results.sarif).
- Dependabot is configured (.github/dependabot.yml) to open weekly dependency update PRs across npm packages.
- Local grep/search of the repository snapshot did not reveal plaintext secrets or tokens. Files repo-secrets-scan.txt and repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt in the repo are empty in this snapshot (no secrets present in committed text here).
- package.json contains security-oriented scripts (audit:fix, security:local) and a build/test/CI workflow that exercises linting, type checking, tests, Playwright E2E; SBOM generation is attempted in the security audit workflow (npx @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-bom).
- This is primarily a static/frontend site (no server-side code in repo), which reduces some attack surface but does not eliminate supply-chain / build-time risks.
- Minor concerns: package-lock.json (or other lockfile) is not visible in this snapshot (workflows use npm ci which expects a lockfile); many dev dependencies exist (dev count in audit.json metadata is high) which increases supply-chain exposure if not locked and regularly audited.

**Next Steps:**
- Ensure a committed package lockfile (package-lock.json) is present in the repository and kept up to date so npm ci and reproducible audits behave deterministically; commit it if intentionally omitted.
- Configure branch protection rules and require passing security workflows (CodeQL and secret-scan) and Dependabot PR review/merges to reduce risk of regressions slipping into main.
- Consider failing PR checks on CodeQL findings and surfacing SARIF results in PRs so developers must triage findings before merging.
- Automate SBOM generation and retention (ensure npx @cyclonedx/... runs reliably in CI and upload sbom.json as an artifact for supply-chain audits).
- Ensure CI artifacts (audit.json, repo-secrets-scan.json, etc.) are stored only in secure artifact storage and that any artifacts containing potentially sensitive data are redacted prior to upload.
- Add monitoring/alerting for new high/critical advisories (e.g., GitHub Dependabot alerts + webhook/Slack/email notifications) so triage happens promptly.
- Periodically run local and CI 'security:local' (npm audit + parse) and verify the secret-scan workflow on a branch to ensure redaction and fail behavior are correct.
- If deploying to production, ensure TLS/HTTPS is enforced at hosting level and review any runtime configuration for secrets (use environment secrets and a secrets manager; never commit plaintext credentials).

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Repository has a healthy, well-documented git history, CI integration, tags and branch structure. Commit messages are generally clear and conventional, .gitignore is comprehensive and pre-commit hooks are present. Minor issues: working directory is not clean (several tracked modified files), no .gitattributes found, and some automation commits by a bot (voder-bot) dominate recent activity — these are not critical but worth addressing.
- Repository is a git repo with 296 commits (git rev-list --count HEAD = 296).
- Recent commits are present and descriptive (example recent commit: dbda4c8 'ci(security): reorganize security-audit workflow to run e2e before audit parsing').
- Conventional commit-style prefixes are used frequently (ci(...), chore(...), test(...), docs:), making history readable and machine-parsable.
- Multiple branches exist locally and remotely (main, fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage, various cleanup/* branches). Remote references (remotes/origin/...) present.
- Tags exist for releases (v1.0.0-complete, v1.0.1).
- No untracked files reported by git ls-files --others --exclude-standard (working tree mostly tracked).
- Working directory is not clean: modified tracked files include .voder/.processes.json, .voder/history.md, .voder/last-action.md, and e2e-stability.json (git status shows modified files).
- .gitignore is present and comprehensive (ignores node_modules, build outputs, env files, logs, coverage, tmp folders, etc.).
- .husky/pre-commit exists and runs format:check, lint:check and type-check — pre-commit hooks are configured to enforce code quality locally.
- .github/workflows contains CI workflows (ci.yml, e2e-stability.yml, security-audit.yml, etc.) indicating CI integration and that CI-related files are tracked in git.
- No .gitattributes file was found in the repository (search returned no matches).
- Author activity shows both human (Tom Howard: 190 commits) and bot (voder-bot: 107 commits) contributors; local git config user.name and user.email are set to voder-bot.
- Some repository-internal runtime/state files (.voder/*) are tracked and appear in modified state despite .voder being generally filtered; this suggests tracked state files that may be intended to be ignored in some contexts.

**Next Steps:**
- Clean or commit the modified tracked files (e2e-stability.json and .voder/*). If these .voder files should not be tracked, remove them from the index (git rm --cached) and add to .gitignore; otherwise commit them with descriptive messages.
- Add a .gitattributes file (recommended) to control line endings, diff/merge behavior for binaries, and ensure consistent behavior across platforms.
- If automation commits should have a distinct identity, ensure bot commits use a clearly scoped bot identity and consider documenting automated commit rules in CONTRIBUTING or docs.
- Consider enforcing commit message linting (commitlint or similar) and/or a changelog/release process for more consistent release notes (history already looks good but can be formalized).
- Consider adding branch protection rules (on remote host) and a documented branching strategy (e.g., main for releases, feature/fix/* naming conventions) to the repo docs if not already enforced by policy.
- Review tracked runtime/state files under .voder and decide whether they should remain tracked. If they are ephemeral state, untrack and ignore them to keep the repo state clean.
- Optionally enable signed commits or CI checks that verify commit authorship if stronger provenance is required for releases.
