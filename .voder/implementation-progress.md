## Story Assessment Results

### 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION - PASSED

**Acceptance Criteria Assessment:**

- ✅ **AC1: GitHub Actions only deployments** - PASSED: vercel.json updated to use git.deploymentEnabled: false, preventing automatic Vercel deployments. GitHub Actions workflow now controls all deployments via Vercel CLI
- ✅ **AC2: Quality gate enforcement** - PASSED: deploy.yml workflow includes check-required-workflows job that waits for CI, Security Audit, and Secret Scan completion before deployment
- ✅ **AC3: Vercel deployment protection** - PASSED: vercel.json configured with git.deploymentEnabled: false provides deployment protection by preventing automatic deployments
- ✅ **AC4: CI & testing prerequisites** - PASSED: check-required-workflows job waits for "CI & Playwright multi-browser tests" completion before allowing deployment
- ✅ **AC5: Security scan prerequisites** - PASSED: check-required-workflows job waits for "Security Audit (npm audit)" and "Secret Scan (gitleaks)" completion before deployment
- ✅ **AC6: Vercel CLI in GitHub Actions** - PASSED: deploy.yml workflow uses Vercel CLI commands (vercel --prod, vercel ls, vercel inspect) for deployment control
- ✅ **AC7: Deployment success verification** - PASSED: Workflow includes comprehensive deployment verification using vercel ls and vercel inspect commands with status reporting
- ✅ **AC8: Status reporting to GitHub** - PASSED: GitHub Actions provides automatic status reporting for workflow execution with deployment URLs
- ✅ **AC9: Emergency override capability** - PASSED: emergency-override.yml workflow provides manual deployment override capability
- ✅ **AC10: Rollback capability** - PASSED: rollback.yml workflow exists with Vercel rollback functionality
- ✅ **AC11: Vercel domain configuration** - PASSED: vercel.json includes proper domain configuration for voder.ai

**Status**: PASSED (11 passed, 0 failed out of 11 acceptance criteria)

**Implementation Summary:**
- Successfully implemented GitHub Actions controlled deployment by updating vercel.json to disable automatic deployments (git.deploymentEnabled: false)
- Enhanced deploy.yml workflow with comprehensive quality gate dependencies and Vercel CLI integration
- Added deployment verification and status reporting capabilities
- Maintained emergency override and rollback functionalities
- All acceptance criteria now satisfied with GitHub Actions controlling all production deployments
