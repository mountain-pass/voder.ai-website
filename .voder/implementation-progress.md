Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (58.25% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The repository is functionally solid and many developer workflows are present (Vite build, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest). However several required thresholds are not met: Documentation and Security have no assessment coverage (0%), Testing, Dependencies, Code Quality, and Version Control fall below the required targets. Because multiple critical areas score below their required thresholds the overall status must be INCOMPLETE. Priorities are focused on producing missing docs, closing security gaps, and stabilizing tests/coverage.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Create comprehensive developer documentation (README, install & verify steps, prepare script docs) and a security checklist as the immediate next step.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The project is functionally complete for a small static pre-launch website: it has clear entry points (src/main.ts, src/app.ts), an index.html that loads the app, a working build pipeline (Vite + TypeScript) and a test suite that passes. The npm scripts provide developer workflows and helper scripts. The only observed runtime hiccup was inability to start the dev server in this environment (spawn ETIMEDOUT), but the production build and tests succeeded, indicating the core functionality works.
- Main entry points present: src/main.ts imports ./app.js and src/style.css; src/app.ts exposes an init() function that renders the '#app' container.
- index.html includes <script type="module" src="/src/main.ts"> so the app is wired for Vite dev/production builds.
- Unit tests present under tests/ (main.test.ts, health-check-utils.test.ts, prepare-libraries.test.ts, coverage-increase.test.ts).
- Test run succeeded: Vitest reported 4 test files, 14 tests — all passed (see test run output).
- Production build succeeded: `npm run build` ran tsc + vite build with output indicating built assets (dist/index.html and dist/assets/*).
- Package.json contains numerous developer scripts (dev, build, preview, test, type-check, lint, verify, health-check, prepare, etc.), improving developer experience and automation.
- Health and maintenance scripts exist (scripts/health-check.js, scripts/prepare-libraries.js) and are covered by tests, showing attention to operational tooling.
- Vite + TypeScript configuration files are present (tsconfig.build.json, vite.config.ts, vitest.config.ts) and used successfully in the build/test steps.
- Node engine requirement in package.json (>=22.17.0) is enforced and the health-check script includes engine checks — beneficial but requires matching Node runtime.
- Attempt to run the dev server in this environment failed with spawn ETIMEDOUT (npm run dev). This appears to be an environment/runner limitation; build and tests did not suffer.
- No backend/API endpoints are present or required — project is a static site, so absence of server endpoints is expected.
- There are no failing tests or build errors; coverage tooling is configured (vitest config with html/text reporters).

**Next Steps:**
- Attempt `npm run dev` in a normal local environment (Node >=22.17.0) to confirm the Vite dev server starts and the site loads in a browser — the ETIMEDOUT seen here is likely CI/environment-specific.
- Add a short smoke/integration test or an HTTP check against the preview server (npm run preview) in CI to ensure dev/preview servers start successfully in automated runs.
- Document required Node version prominently in README (already present) and consider adding an .nvmrc or .node-version file to simplify local setup.
- If desired, expand functional coverage with an end-to-end test (Playwright / Cypress) to verify the built site renders and critical UI elements are visible in a real browser environment.
- Ensure the verify CI flow (or GitHub Actions) runs the health-check, build, and tests to prevent regressions — currently scripts are present; wire them into CI if not already.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (78% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Overall code quality appears good: the repo has a comprehensive linting/formatting/testing configuration (ESLint flat config, Prettier, stylelint, htmlhint, Vitest + test helpers) and the small TypeScript source shows consistent naming and defensive error handling. Shortcomings: there are no actual test files exercised in this snapshot, I could not run linters/type-checks because dev dependencies are not installed in the environment, and one lint config references built artifacts (dist) which may be brittle for local lint runs.
- Strong linting/formatting setup observed: eslint.config.ts and layered configs under config/eslint (base.ts, dx.ts, performance.ts) with TypeScript-aware rules and practical DX rules (simple-import-sort, import/no-duplicates, @typescript-eslint rules).
- Prettier is configured (prettier.config.ts) and scripts exist in package.json for format, lint, stylelint, htmlhint, markdown linting and combined verify flow (package.json scripts).
- TypeScript is configured (tsconfig.json, tsconfig.build.json) with path aliases and includes the config and test directories. Vitest config and testing setup exist under config/testing with good test helpers and environment setup (mocks for Canvas/IntersectionObserver, TextEncoder patch, DOM cleanup).
- Sources are small and well organized under src/ (app.ts, main.ts, style.css). Code style is consistent (camelCase names, TypeScript types in helpers), and components show defensive error handling (try/catch in renderComponent, console.error with context in setup and app).
- I could not run eslint, tsc, prettier or vitest locally because devDependencies are not installed in this environment (npm run lint failed). No lint/test output could be produced to confirm zero warnings/errors.
- No test files were found (search returned no *.test.* or *.spec.* files). Vitest is configured and setup helpers are present, but there are no actual unit tests in the repository snapshot to validate runtime behavior or guard regressions.
- No obvious code duplication in the small codebase. The helper code and test setup are modular and reusable.
- Minor brittleness: htmlhint.config.js imports a file from ./dist/config/linting/html.js; that file is in dist and appears to be excluded by ignore rules, which could cause local linting if the dist artifact isn't present. Similarly, some scripts expect repository build artifacts or prepared distributions (scripts/prepare-libraries.js referenced in package.json).

**Next Steps:**
- Install dev dependencies and run the linters and type-check locally: npm ci && npm run lint:check && npm run format:check && npm run type-check. Capture and fix any lint/type errors; add lint:check to CI if not already enforced.
- Run the test suite (npm test and npm run test:coverage) after installing dependencies. Add meaningful unit tests for src/* (at least for app.init and main flow) to validate behavior and keep coverage targeted by vitest config.
- Avoid referencing built artifacts for lint configs that are required for local development (e.g., htmlhint importing from dist). Either commit the source config or make lint config import the source module so fresh clones don't require a build step.
- Add CI gating for lint, type-check, and tests (if not present already) and consider pre-commit hooks (husky / lint-staged) to ensure code style and checks run before commits.
- If the codebase will grow, add more static-analysis rules (consider enabling stricter @typescript-eslint rules selectively), and add automated checks for code duplication (eg. tools or code review rules) and error-handling patterns.
- Add at least a minimal set of tests demonstrating component rendering and error conditions (use the provided testing helpers) so future regressions are caught and to validate the test setup is correct.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (65% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Vitest-based unit tests exist and all tests pass locally, but coverage enforcement (90% global thresholds) is unmet and causes coverage runs/CI to fail. Tests are unit-level only and coverage reports show large uncovered areas.
- Vitest is configured and used (devDependency vitest, vitest.config.ts, config/testing/ setup files).
- package.json defines test scripts: "test" (vitest run), "test:coverage" (vitest run --coverage), "test:ci" (vitest run --coverage --reporter=verbose).
- Test files present: tests/coverage-increase.test.ts, tests/health-check-utils.test.ts, tests/main.test.ts, tests/prepare-libraries.test.ts and tests/setup.ts.
- Running `npm test` succeeded: 4 test files, 14 tests — all passed (no failing tests).
- Coverage configuration enforces strict global thresholds (90% for branches/functions/lines/statements) in config/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts.
- Running coverage (`npm run test:coverage`) fails due to unmet thresholds: lines 4.35%, statements 4.35%, functions 85.71%, branches 85.22%.
- Coverage run emits numerous sourcemap warnings about missing .d.ts.map files under config/dist (noisy and should be addressed).
- Current tests are unit tests only; no integration or end-to-end tests were detected.
- Repository 'verify' script includes the coverage/CI step, so CI/verification will fail until coverage or configuration is updated.

**Next Steps:**
- Open the coverage HTML report (npm run test:coverage -> coverage/index.html) to identify uncovered files/lines and prioritize tests that exercise runtime code (start with src/app.ts and src/main.ts).
- Increase test coverage by adding unit and integration tests for uncovered code, or relax coverage enforcement (lower thresholds or set per-file thresholds/exclusions) to allow CI to pass while tests are expanded.
- Address sourcemap warnings by ensuring referenced config packages are built or adjusting imports/resolution to avoid loading missing .d.ts.map files, reducing noise during test/coverage runs.
- Introduce higher-level tests where appropriate (integration tests for critical flows, E2E tests for the built site) to improve confidence beyond unit tests.
- Adjust CI/verify behavior to run strict coverage checks on main or release branches only, and document test and coverage expectations in the README or CONTRIBUTING.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Core execution workflows work: dependencies install, production build completes, and the test suite passes. A few runtime/CI-style checks (health-check/type-check and preview) failed in this environment due to invocation/timeouts which prevent a perfect score. The app itself is simple, has basic runtime error handling, and functionality is verified by tests.
- npm ci completed successfully and installed dependencies (added 662 packages); audit reported 0 vulnerabilities.
- Node version present: v22.17.1 which satisfies the package.json engines requirement.
- npm run build succeeded: TypeScript compile + Vite production build completed and produced a dist/ directory with index.html and assets.
- npm test (Vitest) succeeded: 4 test files, 14 tests passed; coverage tooling is configured in vitest.config.ts.
- The application code contains basic runtime error handling: src/app.ts logs an error and returns when the #app element is missing (tests assert this behavior).
- npm run preview failed in this environment with a spawnSync ETIMEDOUT (could not start the preview server here). The build artifacts still exist in dist/.
- npm run health-check failed: the health-check script reported 'TypeScript type-check failed with exit code 2'. Attempts to run tsc directly failed in this run (tsc not found in PATH), though npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json executed without visible errors earlier during build. This indicates an environment/path or spawn behavior issue when the health-check spawns commands.
- Some npm scripts invoked via child_process.spawn (health-check's runCommand) produced non-zero/timeout errors in this sandboxed environment. Lint/type-check/format checks could not be fully validated here due to those spawn/timeout issues.

**Next Steps:**
- Re-run health-check (npm run health-check) locally in a normal shell and inspect the TypeScript output: run npm run type-check directly to capture TypeScript diagnostics and fix any reported type errors.
- If health-check fails due to tsc not being found, ensure node_modules/.bin is available to npm scripts or modify the health-check to call npx tsc (or use npm scripts which already resolve local binaries).
- To validate preview behavior, run npm run preview locally (or vite preview) on a machine where server ports and long-running child processes are allowed; the ETIMEDOUT here is environment-specific and not necessarily a project defect.
- If CI needs to run health-check programmatically, consider making the health-check runner more robust to PATH differences (use shell: true or explicitly call npm from a known path, or use npx for tools), and capture/stream stderr/stdout to make debugging easier.
- Run lint and format checks locally (npm run lint:check, npm run format:check) and fix any issues. Add CI automation to fail early with clear output so contributors see the exact failing command.
- Consider adding a short smoke/integration script to start the preview server in the background and perform an HTTP request to validate the built site in CI, or use a headless server test for the preview step.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (0% ± 20% COMPLETE)
- Assessment failed due to error: Assessment was cancelled
- Error occurred during DOCUMENTATION assessment: Assessment was cancelled

**Next Steps:**
- Check assessment system configuration
- Verify project accessibility

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (75% ± 13% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are declared and an automated audit shows no known vulnerabilities, but reproducibility and maintenance practices need improvement. The repository does not expose a lockfile and I was unable to run an outdated-check in this environment. Overall the dependency setup is functional and safe today, but improvements to lockfile management, periodic updates, and automation are recommended.
- package.json exists and lists dependencies and devDependencies (production deps: @microsoft/clarity, gsap, three; many devDependencies including vite, typescript, vitest, eslint, prettier, etc.).
- npm audit --json (and the repository audit.json) reports 0 vulnerabilities across info/low/moderate/high/critical (auditReportVersion: 2). Output: { "vulnerabilities": {}, "metadata": { "vulnerabilities": {"total":0}, "dependencies": { "prod":27, "dev":739, "total":765 } } }
- npm ls --depth=0 --json executed successfully and shows the top-level installed packages and resolved versions (examples: vite@7.1.5, typescript@5.9.2, prettier@3.6.2, three@0.180.0, gsap@3.13.0, @microsoft/clarity@1.0.0).
- package-lock.json exists locally but is excluded by repository ignore rules / not readable in this environment (read_file returned: 'File package-lock.json is excluded by .gitignore or .voderignore patterns'). The lockfile is not present in the repository listing, indicating it is not committed to VCS.
- Attempt to run npm outdated failed in this environment (npm outdated returned an error; npm outdated --json also failed). Because of that I could not produce an authoritative list of outdated packages from this environment.
- Top-level dependency list from npm ls and package.json are consistent (no obvious extraneous top-level packages reported by npm ls --depth=0).
- Repository includes security-related scripts and docs (SECURITY.md, scripts to run npm audit and parse results, a 'security:local' script that writes audit.json), showing process awareness for audits.

**Next Steps:**
- Commit a lockfile to version control (package-lock.json) or adopt a lockfile policy (npm/pnpm/yarn) and ensure CI uses it (npm ci). This increases reproducibility and makes audits/upgrades deterministic.
- Run npm outdated (or use npm-check-updates / Dependabot) in CI or locally to get a current list of packages that can be updated; schedule periodic dependency updates and test them in CI.
- Enable automated dependency upgrade PRs (Dependabot / Renovate) so updates and security patches are proposed continuously.
- Add an explicit dependency-audit step to CI (npm audit --production or snyk/gh-dependabot alerts) and fail builds on critical/high advisories.
- If keeping package-lock.json out of VCS is intentional, document the rationale in README/SECURITY.md and ensure CI reproduces installs deterministically (pin exact versions or use a lockfile artifact).
- Investigate why npm outdated failed in this analysis environment and re-run outdated checks locally/CI to identify outdated dependencies; review and test updates for breaking changes before merging.
- Consider pruning unused dev dependencies (audit the codebase for tooling that may no longer be used) to reduce dependency surface and transitive risk.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (0% ± 20% COMPLETE)
- Assessment failed due to error: Assessment was cancelled
- Error occurred during SECURITY assessment: Assessment was cancelled

**Next Steps:**
- Check assessment system configuration
- Verify project accessibility

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (78% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- Repository shows a healthy git history (consistent commit messages, tags, remote) and a sensible .gitignore. However the working tree is not clean (modified and untracked files), there is no .gitattributes, no visible GitHub workflow files in .github/workflows, and no client-side hook tooling tracked (e.g., .husky). These issues reduce readiness for strict CI/PR workflows.
- Git repository present (.git directory exists) and remote configured: origin -> https://github.com/mountain-pass/voder.ai-website.git
- Current branch is 'main' and is ahead of origin/main by 1 commit (git status --porcelain -b reported 'ahead 1')
- Working directory has modified tracked files: .voder/history.md, .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md, .voder/progress-chart.png, .voder/progress-log-areas.csv, .voder/progress-log.csv (reported as 'M')
- Untracked files found: scripts/health-check-utils.js, scripts/health-check-utils.ts, tests/coverage-increase.test.ts, tests/health-check-utils.test.ts, tests/prepare-libraries.test.ts (git ls-files --others --exclude-standard)
- Commit history present and uses consistent, informative commit messages (conventional prefixes like feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, ci:). Recent commits include 'docs: add README...' and 'ci(security): add npm audit workflow...'
- Release tags exist (git tag -n): v1.0.0-complete, v1.0.1
- .gitignore exists and is comprehensive for a Node/Vite/TS project (node_modules, build outputs, env files, coverage, logs, etc.)
- No .gitattributes file found at repository root
- .github directory exists but contains no workflow files under .github/workflows in the checked tree (no local GitHub Actions workflows detected)
- No husky or similar client-side hook directory found (.husky not present)
- package-lock.json is tracked, which supports reproducible installs

**Next Steps:**
- Clean up the working tree: review and either commit or stash/reset the modified .voder/* files. Example: git add .voder && git commit -m "docs: update progress files"
- Handle untracked files intentionally: git add/commit if they belong in repo, or add appropriate patterns to .gitignore if they are transient. Use git clean -n to preview removals before cleaning.
- Add a .gitattributes file to enforce consistent line endings and other attributes across platforms (e.g., '* text=auto') to improve diffs and merges.
- If CI is expected in this repo, add GitHub Actions workflow files under .github/workflows or confirm workflows are managed externally; ensure CI configs are versioned in the repo.
- Consider adding developer-side hooks (husky) or documented pre-commit checks and a CONTRIBUTING.md describing branching, commit message conventions, and release/tagging process.
- Push local commits/branches to the remote to synchronize state with CI and collaborators: git push origin main (and other branches as needed).
- Optionally enforce a clean working tree in CI (fail builds on unstaged/untracked files) and add a brief section in README/CONTRIBUTING about expected git hygiene.
