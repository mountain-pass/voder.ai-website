![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (74% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
Overall the repository is largely functional and well-structured: it builds, unit tests run, and developer tooling is present. However several required thresholds are not met (notably Testing, Documentation, Security, Dependencies and Version Control gaps). The verification pipeline and coverage targets need focused remediation before release-readiness.

## NEXT PRIORITY
First priority: bring the test/CI verification gate green — reproduce failing CI locally, raise unit test coverage for uncovered modules and fix failing tests so the verify pipeline (type-check → lint → format → build → test) completes reliably.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- The project is functional as a small static pre-launch website: main entry points exist, app initialization works, the test suite passes, and a production build completes. Minor issues (a failing type-check command in this environment and references to missing config files) prevent a higher score.
- Main entry point exists: src/main.ts imports ./app.js and ./style.css and initializes the app on DOMContentLoaded.
- Application logic implemented: src/app.ts exports init() which locates #app and injects the site markup (title, copy, subtitle).
- Static HTML entry present: index.html contains <div id="app"> and loads /src/main.ts as a module.
- Build succeeded: npm run build completed (tsc + vite build) and vite reported built assets.
- Tests passed: npm test (Vitest) ran and reported 4 test files with 14 tests total, all passing.
- Type-check command failed in this environment: npm run type-check (tsc --noEmit) returned an error when executed here.
- Configuration references appear missing: tsconfig.* and vitest.config.ts reference ./config/* and ./config/testing/* files that are not visible in the repository listing, though build and tests still ran.
- Dist artifacts were generated by the build, but attempts to read them were blocked by .gitignore/.voderignore in this environment, limiting direct inspection of output files.
- Vite dev/preview config present: vite.config.ts defines server/preview ports and useful aliases, enabling local dev experience via npm run dev.

**Next Steps:**
- Run and fix TypeScript type-checking: execute `npm run type-check` locally, inspect compiler errors, and update code/tsconfig to resolve issues so the script succeeds.
- Locate or restore referenced config files: ensure the ./config and ./config/testing artifacts referenced by tsconfig/vitest exist in the repo or update configuration to remove stale references.
- Ensure CI runs verification steps: add/verify CI job runs `npm run verify` (or at minimum type-check, build, and tests) to catch regressions early.
- Add a small runtime smoke test: create an integration or E2E test (or a Vitest jsdom test) that asserts the built index contains expected content to validate runtime behavior.
- Make build artifacts inspectable in this environment: adjust .voderignore/.gitignore or tooling so dist/ outputs can be read during automated assessments and debugging.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- Overall code quality is good: the project includes comprehensive lint/format/test configurations (ESLint flat config, Prettier, Stylelint, Vitest), TypeScript strict mode, and a small, well-organized source tree with tests that pass. I could not run ESLint in this environment (npm run lint failed), and a few lint rules are permissive (e.g. no-explicit-any is turned off), so I reduced the score to reflect those minor gaps and inability to validate lint results here.
- ESLint configuration present and well-structured: eslint.config.ts plus config/eslint/{base,dx,performance}.ts defining layered rules and TypeScript-aware parsing.
- Prettier configuration present: prettier.config.ts and package.json scripts for format / format:check.
- Stylelint and htmlhint configurations exist (stylelint.config.ts, htmlhint.config.js) and package.json includes lint:css and lint:html scripts.
- TypeScript setup: tsconfig.json extends config/typescript/base.json with "strict": true in base compiler options, and paths/aliases configured.
- Tests exist and run successfully: `npm run test` ran Vitest and reported 4 test files, 14 tests passing (output captured during assessment).
- Source is small and organized under src/ (src/app.ts, src/main.ts, src/style.css) with consistent naming and modular separation (init exported from app.ts for testability).
- Error handling is present in code: app.init logs an error and returns when #app is missing; scripts/prepare-libraries.js use try/catch and explicit warnings/errors.
- Attempt to run linter failed in this environment: `npm run lint` returned an execution failure (no ESLint output captured). I could not confirm the project is lint-clean or whether autofix would be needed.
- Some ESLint rules are permissive by design: '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any' is turned off and 'no-var' is off, which is a conscious DX choice but reduces strictness for code quality enforcement.
- No obvious code duplication or large maintenance smells in inspected source — repository is small so duplication check is limited in scope.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the full lint pipeline locally or in CI: npm run lint:check (or npm run verify) to surface lint errors/warnings. Fix any reported issues or adjust config if rules are intentionally permissive.
- Enable/validate ESLint execution in CI to guarantee lint checks run in reproducible environment (Node version matching engines >=22.17.0). Capture and act on lint output in CI logs.
- Consider tightening permissive rules once the team is ready (e.g., enable '@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any', enforce no-var). Start with warnings then escalate to errors.
- Add a pre-commit hook (husky or similar) to run lint:fix and format to keep code consistent before pushes/PRs.
- Expand test coverage for any new runtime code and add linting/type-checking as blocking steps in CI to prevent regressions.
- If running ESLint in this project requires transpiling the flat config (eslint.config.ts), ensure CI runners have Node+TypeScript setup to evaluate the config or provide a JS fallback to avoid execution failure.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (65% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Project has a working unit test setup (Vitest + jsdom + testing-library) and all existing tests pass locally, but configured global coverage thresholds (90%) are not met — coverage run fails and will break CI gates. Improve coverage or relax thresholds to stabilize verification.
- Testing framework: vitest configured (vitest.config.ts) with jsdom environment and @testing-library/jest-dom present.
- Test files located under tests/: coverage-increase.test.ts, health-check-utils.test.ts, main.test.ts, prepare-libraries.test.ts, plus tests/setup.ts.
- Local unit test run (npm test -> vitest run) succeeded: 4 test files, 14 tests — all tests passed.
- Coverage is configured with 90% thresholds (branches/functions/lines/statements) via config/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts.
- Running coverage (npm run test:coverage) fails: lines/statements ~4.35%, functions ~85.71%, branches ~85.22% — below 90% thresholds, causing failure.
- npm scripts include test:coverage and test:ci (test:ci runs coverage + verbose) and verify runs test:ci, so CI/verification will fail until coverage is addressed.
- Numerous 'Failed to load source map' warnings emitted during coverage run for files under config/dist/*.d.ts.map — noisy output that should be resolved or excluded.
- Tests are unit/small-integration focused (DOM behavior, utilities). No end-to-end (e2e) tests or e2e tooling detected.

**Next Steps:**
- Decide coverage gate policy: either add tests to meet 90% thresholds or lower thresholds in vitest configuration to realistic interim targets and plan incremental improvement.
- Open coverage HTML report (coverage/html) to find untested files/lines and add targeted unit tests to raise lines/statements coverage.
- Address 'Failed to load source map' warnings by providing or excluding the referenced .d.ts.map files or adjusting Vite/Vitest config to ignore those paths.
- Consider separating fast unit test runs (npm test) from coverage/CICD gates so contributors receive quick feedback while coverage increases are worked on.
- Document test-running and coverage guidance in README or CONTRIBUTING to help contributors reproduce test runs and add meaningful tests.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The project builds cleanly and unit tests pass; the production bundle is produced by Vite. Runtime/start (vite preview) could not be run in this environment (spawn timeout), but there were no build or test errors. Execution is solid for a small static site with minor operational issues (preview/run and an isolated command execution hiccup).
- npm install completed successfully; the repository's prepare script linked required packages.
- npm run build succeeded: TypeScript compile (tsc -p tsconfig.build.json) and vite build completed. Build output (dist) was produced according to the build log.
- Artifacts reported by the build: dist/index.html, dist/assets/main-*.css, dist/assets/main-*.js (vite reported sizes and maps).
- All tests passed: npm run test (vitest) ran 4 test files — 14 tests passed (no failures).
- App contains minimal runtime error handling: src/app.ts checks for #app and logs console.error('App element not found') if missing; src/main.ts logs a startup warning.
- Attempt to run npm run preview (vite preview) failed in this environment with spawnSync ETIMEDOUT — likely an environment/timeout restriction rather than a code error.
- Attempt to run npm run type-check directly also failed to run in this environment (command execution error), but tsc succeeded as part of the build step.
- No build warnings or test failures were observed in the available logs.
- Project is a small static site (Vite + TypeScript) — runtime surface area is limited (DOM manipulation only), so execution requirements are smaller than a full backend service.

**Next Steps:**
- Re-run npm run preview in a normal environment (local machine or CI runner) to validate the production server startup: vite preview --port <n> or serve the dist/ directory with a static server. Investigate ETIMEDOUT if it recurs (increase timeout, ensure /bin/sh available).
- Run npm run type-check and npm run lint locally/CI to ensure separate commands function reliably (the build ran tsc successfully, but the standalone task failed to execute here).
- Add a small smoke/integration step in CI that runs vite preview (or a static-server) and performs a basic HTTP request to the served index.html to verify runtime serveability.
- Consider strengthening runtime error handling and logging (currently only a missing #app check) and add a small end-to-end/manual test in CI that loads the built bundle in a headless browser to catch runtime errors.
- If production depends on external dependencies (three, gsap, clarity) that will be used later, add runtime checks and feature-flagging to avoid errors when assets are missing or in unsupported environments.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (50% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- The repository has a useful README with clear setup and developer commands plus a SECURITY.md and audit artifacts, but lacks dedicated API/architectural documentation, a changelog, and many referenced docs/scripts. Inline comments exist but are minimal. Overall documentation is adequate for local setup but incomplete for contributors or maintainers who need API/architecture details or release history.
- README.md is present and contains quick start instructions (prerequisites, install, dev/build/preview commands), testing, linting, verification and troubleshooting guidance. (README.md contents inspected).
- SECURITY.md is present and contains an auto-generated triage summary and guidance; audit files (audit.json, audit-summary.md, audit-postfix.json) are included. (SECURITY.md and audit*.json inspected).
- package.json contains many helpful scripts (dev, build, test, lint, verify, docs:setup, docs:report, prepare, health-check, audit:fix, etc.) and Node engine requirement. (package.json inspected).
- Source files in src/ (main.ts, app.ts, style.css) include small, helpful comments and are straightforward, but there are only brief comments — no JSDoc or extensive docstrings. (src/* files inspected).
- No docs/ directory, no API documentation files, and no CHANGELOG.md or release notes were found. (repo searched for docs/** and CHANGELOG*).
- Several scripts referenced in package.json and README are not present in the repository: setup-package-docs.js, scripts/prepare-libraries.js, scripts/health-check.js, .github/scripts/parse-audit.js (these files were not found when searching). This suggests some documentation-to-code drift or missing auxiliary repo files.
- Markdown lint config exists (.markdownlint.json) and README is lint-targeted in scripts, but there are no other markdown docs (find returned no additional .md files besides README and SECURITY).
- No dedicated architectural documents, design rationale, API surface descriptions, examples, or contributor guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md) were found.
- No changelog, release notes, or documented versioning/release process present.
- Test-related scripts exist, but there are no test files discovered in the repo (no tests directory or test files were found).

**Next Steps:**
- Add a top-level docs/ or docs-site with architecture.md describing high-level architecture, build/deploy flow, and design decisions so new contributors and maintainers can onboard faster.
- Create API documentation (even for a small static site) or a README section explaining public modules, entry points, and any runtime configuration/analytics (e.g., clarity/gsap/three usage).
- Add a CHANGELOG.md and document the release process (semantic versioning or release notes) to track changes between releases.
- Resolve documentation-code drift: either add the referenced helper scripts (setup-package-docs.js, scripts/prepare-libraries.js, scripts/health-check.js, .github/scripts/parse-audit.js) to the repo or remove/update package.json/README references to them so scripts are accurate.
- Improve inline documentation: add JSDoc/type comments on exported functions and modules (e.g., init()) and expand code comments where behavior is non-trivial.
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md and a short developer guide (branching model, PR process, testing expectations) so external contributors know how to help.
- If tests are expected, add test files and examples (or remove test scripts if intentionally absent) so the test scripts in package.json reflect reality. If tests are intentionally absent, document that in README.
- Consider adding generated docs/reporting to CI and a docs:report example in README, or provide an example of running docs:setup/docs:report, so maintainers can produce documentation artifacts.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (75% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- The project has a reasonable dependency setup: a clear package.json with runtime and dev dependencies, an engine requirement, an existing lockfile, and automated audit artifacts showing no current vulnerabilities. However I could not fully validate lockfile contents (package-lock.json is present but excluded from reading) or run an outdated check in this environment, and I could not verify whether any runtime dependencies are missing/unused because most source files (src/) are not visible to inspect imports. These limitations prevent a higher score.
- package.json is present and well-formed. Runtime dependencies declared: @microsoft/clarity, gsap, three. Many devDependencies are declared (TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, ESLint, Prettier, etc.).
- package.json enforces a node engine ("node": ">=22.17.0"), which helps reproducible installs.
- There is a package-lock.json file in the repository (check_file_exists reported it exists) but its contents are excluded by project ignore rules, so I could not read/verify exact resolved versions or transitive dependency details.
- An audit artifact audit.json is present and shows zero vulnerabilities (metadata: prod: 27, dev: 739, total: 765). Running npm audit --json in this environment produced the same zero-vuln output.
- The repository contains scripts to manage dependency security: audit:fix (npm audit fix --package-lock-only) and security:local (npm audit --json > audit.json && node ...). There is also a verify script that runs audit:fix as part of CI-local checks.
- I attempted to run npm outdated --json but the command failed in this environment (stderr: N/A), so I could not determine which direct or transitive packages are outdated or need updating.
- I could not inspect source files under src/ (index.html references /src/main.ts but src/ files are not visible/accessible), so I could not check for undeclared runtime imports (i.e., missing dependency declarations) or unused dependencies.
- Some auxiliary audit-related files exist (audit-postfix.json, audit-fix.log) but are mostly excluded by ignore rules or contain only CLI help output; I could not fully inspect audit-fix.log due to ignore rules.

**Next Steps:**
- Run a local install and dynamic checks: npm ci (to use lockfile), then npm outdated --json and npm audit --json to enumerate outdated packages and any advisories. Commit any necessary lockfile updates after review.
- Make the package-lock.json readable in CI/audit steps (or store it unignored) so automated tools, maintainers and reviewers can inspect exact resolved versions and reproduce audits.
- Enable automated dependency updates (Dependabot or Renovate) to keep dependencies up-to-date and capture PRs for version bumps; pair with CI to run tests and lint on those PRs.
- Add a CI job that runs npm audit and npm outdated (or a tool like npm-check-updates) regularly and fails the build on newly introduced high/critical vulnerabilities.
- If possible, expose or add the source files (src/) so static checks can verify that all runtime imports are declared and to allow tree-shaking / unused-dep detection (e.g., depcheck).
- Consider pinning particularly-sensitive runtime dependencies (or using lockfile-only installs in CI) and establishing a regular cadence to run npm audit fix and review any proposed changes.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (72% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- The repository shows evidence of basic security hygiene (a SECURITY.md, automated npm audit artifacts and an audit.json reporting 0 vulnerabilities, .gitignore that excludes env files, and an explicit verify script). I found no plaintext secrets in the scanned files. However large portions of runtime/source (notably a src/ tree referenced by config) were not present in the accessible snapshot or were excluded, and the lockfile contents could not be inspected, so I could not evaluate input validation, authentication, server configuration, or runtime secrets handling. Given the positive signals but significant unknowns, this is a cautious ‘good with gaps’ result.
- npm audit (audit.json produced and re-run) reports 0 vulnerabilities (auditReportVersion: 2, metadata.vulnerabilities.total: 0). I executed `npm audit --json` and inspected audit.json.
- SECURITY.md exists and contains an automated triage/artefact workflow and immediate guidance (references to audit.json, audit-summary.md, repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt and recommendations).
- repo-secrets-scan.txt and repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt are present but contain no content in the repository snapshot I inspected (no secrets visible there).
- .gitignore explicitly excludes environment files (.env*), node_modules, dist, coverage etc., which is good to avoid accidental commit of runtime secrets and build artifacts.
- Searches for common secret markers (SECRET, API_KEY, token, password, AKIA pattern, etc.) in the repository files I could read returned no matches—no obvious hardcoded secrets in the files scanned.
- package.json includes a `verify` script that runs `npm audit fix`, linters, format checks and tests, which is a positive automation touchpoint for CI enforcement if used.
- package-lock.json exists on disk but is excluded by repository rules / could not be read due to ignore rules, preventing review of exact resolved dependency versions and any recent lockfile modifications.
- Many runtime/source files appear to be absent from the accessible snapshot (no src/*.ts files were found though vite/vitest config reference a src/ directory). This prevents assessment of input validation, authentication/authorization logic, and other application-specific security controls.
- The dependency list includes client-side analytics (@microsoft/clarity). This introduces privacy/data collection considerations and requires appropriate consent/processing controls in deployments.
- No CI/GitHub Actions workflows were found/inspected via available tools to confirm enforcement of the documented security checks in CI (I did not find pipeline config in this snapshot).

**Next Steps:**
- Make the full source tree available (or allow access to package-lock.json and src/) so an in-repo audit can include runtime code: inspect input validation, auth/authorization flows, and any server/external request code.
- Commit and/or allow review of package-lock.json (or equivalent lockfile) so dependency versions can be audited and reproducible installs enforced in CI. Ensure CI runs `npm audit` against the lockfile and fails on critical/high findings.
- Run a thorough automated secret scan (git history + current tree) with tools such as gitleaks, truffleHog, or git-secrets across the repository and commit history; rotate any credentials if found.
- Add or confirm CI pipeline enforcement of security checks (npm audit, linters, secret scan, and tests) in GitHub Actions / other CI to ensure the repo-level `verify` steps run on PRs and main merges.
- If the site uses third-party analytics (e.g., @microsoft/clarity), document and verify privacy/consent handling and minimize personally identifiable information sent to vendors.
- If the project is or will be deployed, ensure HTTPS-only configuration at deployment edge, use secure headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options), and scan build artifacts for accidental inclusion of secrets.
- Run dynamic/static analysis against the built output and, if applicable, a backend API (SAST/DAST) to look for injection issues, insecure configurations, and exposed debug endpoints.
- Add an explicit documented secret handling and rotation policy (or expand SECURITY.md) and include instructions for maintainers to use the repo-scanning/redaction artifacts present.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (78% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Version control is healthy overall: clear commit history with conventional messages, remote is configured, important files (package.json, lockfile) are tracked, and a comprehensive .gitignore exists. Score reduced by an unclean working directory, a configured but missing hooks path, absence of .gitattributes, and no evidence of enforced commit signing or hook automation.
- Current branch is 'main' (git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD -> main).
- Working directory is not clean: git status --porcelain shows multiple modified files (e.g. .voder/*, scripts/health-check-utils.{js,ts}, tests/*.ts).
- Commit history is present and recent with conventional-style messages (examples: 'docs: add Developer Setup & Verification guide', 'chore: add health-check script', 'ci(security): add npm audit workflow and parse-audit.js parser').
- Remote 'origin' is configured: https://github.com/mountain-pass/voder.ai-website.git (git remote -v).
- .gitignore exists and is appropriate for Node/Vite projects (node_modules/, dist/, .env, coverage/, .eslintcache, tmp/, etc.).
- Important files are tracked: package.json and package-lock.json are present in the repository.
- .gitattributes is missing (no .gitattributes file found).
- Git config contains core.hookspath set to .husky/_ but there is no .husky directory in the repository — hook path appears misconfigured or hooks not installed.
- Commits are authored by 'voder-bot <voder-bot@example.com>' (git config user.name/email and commit log) — likely intentional but relevant for authorship traceability.
- CI automation exists for security auditing (.github/workflows/security-audit.yml) indicating some repository automation and checks are in place.
- No evidence found of commit-signing enforcement or signed commits in recent history.

**Next Steps:**
- Clean the working directory: commit, stash, or move the modified files into appropriate branches to restore a clean main branch before releases/CI verification.
- Resolve the hook configuration: either install and commit the .husky/ hooks (if using Husky) or remove/adjust core.hookspath in git config to avoid a broken hooks path.
- Add a .gitattributes file to normalize line endings, set export-ignore for appropriate files, and improve cross-platform consistency.
- Consider enabling and enforcing commit signing (GPG/SSH) and configure branch protection rules on the remote repository for stronger provenance and required checks.
- Add or update CONTRIBUTING.md to document commit message conventions, branching strategy, and expected git hygiene; optionally add commit-msg or pre-commit hooks to enforce message format and basic checks.
- Add CI checks (PR-level) for required branch protections: e.g., enforce passing lint/tests/verify and check for signed commits or conventional commit format as needed.
- If repository history contains large or sensitive files, review and, if necessary, use git-filter-repo/BFG or git-lfs to clean history and manage large assets.
