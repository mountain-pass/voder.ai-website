## Recommendations

### 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

1. **Fix E2E Test Title Mismatch**
   ```typescript
   // In tests/e2e/app.spec.ts line 9, either:
   // Option A: Update test to match actual title
   await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Voder - Keep Shipping Fast/);
   
   // Option B: Update application title to match test expectation
   // (requires investigation of where title is set)
   ```

2. **Verify Title Consistency**
   - Determine which title is correct per business requirements
   - Update either test or application to maintain consistency
   - Re-run E2E tests to confirm resolution

### 🔧 QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS (Optional)

1. **Enhanced Error Monitoring**
   - Consider adding Sentry or similar for production error tracking
   - Implement structured logging for better debugging

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Current page load times ~1.5-1.9s are acceptable but could be optimized
   - Consider implementing performance budgets in E2E tests

3. **Testing Enhancements**
