  - ‚úÖ Basic UI mockup showing before/after states
  - ‚úÖ Functional scroll-triggered content update
- **Missing Critical Elements (90% of specified functionality):**
  - ‚ùå **5-second transition from Vision Flow** (diagram zoom out, background darkening, prompt panel fade-in)
  - ‚ùå **Live prompt editing interface** (specification calls for real-time typing/editing - completely missing)
  - ‚ùå **Sophisticated UI transformation system** beyond single text swap (needs complete morph system)

## ‚ö° DISABLED FEATURES (For Stability)

### 3D Graphics Systems

- **Brand Entry:** Three.js 3D objects now ACTIVE with basic wireframe animation
- **Problem Space:** Particle chaos system (`VisualChaos.ts`) - Code exists but intentionally disabled
- **Reason:** VisualChaos disabled in ProblemSection.ts (line 3 commented out import)

### GSAP Target Warnings

Console warnings about missing GSAP targets indicate disabled visual systems:

- `.visual-chaos` - Intentionally disabled 3D chaos effects for Problem Space
- `.journey-diagram` - Replaced by GPS metaphor visualization  
- `.flow-diagram svg line,.flow-diagram svg circle` - Missing animated flow elements
- Various section elements - Due to unimplemented cinematic features

These warnings do not affect functionality and tests pass completely, but indicate substantial missing visual complexity.
