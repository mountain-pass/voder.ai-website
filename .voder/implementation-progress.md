Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 50.5

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (73% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The repository is functionally solid and well-engineered (high functionality and code-quality scores). Tests and execution are strong. However the overall status is INCOMPLETE because several required thresholds were not met: Dependencies (0%), Documentation (75%), Security (78%), and Version Control (78%) fall below the stated acceptance criteria. Prioritize fixing the dependency assessment and CI artifact/lockfile hygiene, then address documentation and security gaps.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Primary next step: restore and validate the dependency assessment (ensure package-lock.json integrity, run npm audit and parse results, enable Dependabot/Renovate, and upload/inspect audit artifacts).



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The repository implements a small static pre-launch website with a clear main entry point, testable initialization logic, and a working test suite. Core front-end behavior (rendering the Voder heading and init wiring) is implemented and verified by automated tests. Project scripts provide dev/build/test workflows. There are no critical missing elements for the stated scope (static site), but the project is small and lacks backend/API surface or E2E browser verification.
- Main entry points present: src/main.ts (bootstraps app) and src/app.ts (init function that renders #app content).
- index.html exists at repo root and style.css is imported by main.ts (src/style.css referenced).
- package.json exposes standard scripts: dev (vite), build (tsc + vite build), preview, test (vitest), lint/format etc.
- Automated tests run successfully: npm test executed locally and Vitest output shows 4 test files, 14 tests — all passed.
- Tests specifically verify core functionality: tests/main.test.ts and tests/coverage-increase.test.ts confirm init() renders the heading and main.ts loads init at the correct time (DOMContentLoaded or immediate).
- Utility scripts and logic have unit tests (e.g., scripts/health-check-utils.js tested by tests/health-check-utils.test.ts and simulate-prepare-libraries behavior tested in prepare-libraries.test.ts).
- Project uses modern toolchain (TypeScript, Vite, Vitest) and enforces Node >=22.17.0 in package.json engines.
- No server-side API endpoints or CLI tools are present — repository is focused on a static front-end site; this matches README but is a limitation if API/CLI was expected.
- No end-to-end browser tests or a running server smoke test were executed; tests use jsdom and unit-level behavior only.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the dev server locally (npm run dev) and visually verify the site at http://localhost:5173; exercise build and preview (npm run build && npm run preview) to confirm production artifacts produce the same output.
- Add at least one end-to-end browser test (Playwright/Puppeteer) to validate the actual rendered DOM/CSS and catch integration issues that jsdom can't surface (e.g., assets, responsive behavior, animations).
- If intended to be purely static, consider adding a simple smoke-check in CI that starts vite preview or serves dist/ and runs an HTTP check to validate the built site.
- Document developer workflow for running tests, building, and previewing in README (already partly present) and add a CONTRIBUTING or DEV section if more contributors are expected.
- If additional functionality is planned (APIs, CLI), add tests and integration points for those surfaces and clearly document expected behaviors and endpoints.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Overall code quality is high: the project has a comprehensive linting/formatting setup, TypeScript type-checking, unit tests with 100% coverage, and well-organized source files. The main issues are repository documentation/markdown style violations and a small number of formatting warnings in hidden .voder files; source TS/CSS/HTML linting and tests pass.
- ESLint is configured via eslint.config.ts and an extensive config tree under config/eslint (base, dx, performance). The project uses @typescript-eslint, import, simple-import-sort, and other plugins.
- Running the project's lint commands produced no ESLint or stylelint errors for the source files (npm run lint / npm run lint:css both returned with no reported errors).
- Prettier is configured (prettier.config.ts). Running format:check reported code style issues but only in .voder/* files (two warnings: .voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md).
- HTML linting (htmlhint) returned no errors for the site's HTML.
- Markdown linting (markdownlint-cli2 via npm run lint:md) produced many errors across docs/libraries/* and README.md — numerous MD_* rule violations (hard tabs, missing headings, trailing spaces, fenced-code language missing, etc.).
- Type checking passed (tsc --noEmit completed without errors).
- Automated tests pass (vitest run): 14/14 tests passed. Coverage run shows 100% coverage for app.ts and main.ts (overall 100%).
- Source code in src is small and well organized: app.ts holds init logic (testable), main.ts is an entry wrapper, style.css separated. Tests are present under tests/ and there are utility scripts under scripts/.
- Error handling and defensive programming examples present: app.ts checks for #app and logs an error; scripts/health-check-utils.ts handles invalid inputs (parseVersion returns null; compareSemver returns null when parse fails).
- Naming conventions are consistent and idiomatic (app.ts, main.ts, health-check-utils.ts).
- No obvious code duplication in the small codebase; functions are small and single-purpose.

**Next Steps:**
- Fix markdown lint issues: run markdownlint-cli2 with --fix where safe and correct the remaining violations in docs/libraries/* and README.md (address hard tabs, heading rules, trailing spaces, fenced code languages).
- Run Prettier across the repo (npm run format) and commit fixes; exclude or clean up .voder files if they are transient, or add a .prettierignore entry for intentionally generated files.
- Ensure CI includes the repo verification steps already available in package.json (the verify script runs audit:fix, lint:fix, lint:check, format:check, build, test:ci) and make markdown linting a gate so docs issues fail CI if you want stricter repo hygiene.
- Consider adding a package-lock.json (or ensure lockfile management consistent) if the project relies on checkLockfileAndNodeModules; document how lockfiles are managed in CONTRIBUTING.md or similar.
- If the project will grow, add stricter ESLint rules for production code (e.g., disallow console in non-script files, enable some currently-off @typescript-eslint rules) and add pre-commit hooks to run format/lint:fix (husky is present so hooks can be enabled/configured).
- Periodically run the full lint/test/format pipeline locally and in CI to keep docs and code aligned; consider auto-fixing docs where possible with markdownlint-cli2 --fix and CI tooling.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (85% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- The project has a solid, working test suite: Vitest-based unit/DOM tests exist and run successfully locally (all tests passed) and the V8 coverage report shows 100% coverage for the app/main sources. Test tooling and CI steps are configured. The main limitations are scope: tests are unit/DOM-level (jsdom/happy-dom) and there are no visible end-to-end (Playwright/Cypress) tests or browser E2E artifacts in the repo; several other code areas (scripts, config) are not covered by tests.
- Test files found: tests/main.test.ts, tests/coverage-increase.test.ts, tests/health-check-utils.test.ts, tests/prepare-libraries.test.ts, tests/setup.ts.
- Testing framework and tooling: vitest (devDependency), @testing-library/jest-dom, jsdom/happy-dom, jest-axe present in devDependencies. Vitest config at vitest.config.ts with setupFiles and coverage configuration.
- Package.json scripts include: test (vitest run), test:watch, test:coverage, test:ci (vitest run --coverage --reporter=verbose) and other verification scripts that run tests in CI.
- I executed the test suite via: npm run test:ci. Output: 14 tests passed (14), 4 test files; all tests passed locally.
- Coverage: vitest reported 100% statements/branches/functions/lines for the instrumented files (app.ts and main.ts) in the local run; coverage provider is v8 and reporters include text/json/html (as configured).
- Tests types present: unit tests for utilities, DOM-level integration tests using a DOM environment (jsdom/happy-dom). Tests simulate filesystem behavior in prepare-libraries test (using temp directories).
- CI workflow: .github/workflows/ci.yml exists and invokes linting, build, test:ci, and later mentions Playwright cache and Lighthouse CI steps. However, there are no Playwright test files or Playwright config in the repo (no e2e tests were found).
- Vitest coverage excludes include many config and scripts directories (config/**, scripts/**), so some project code is intentionally excluded from coverage.
- No failing tests were observed locally; therefore scoring is not reduced for test failures.

**Next Steps:**
- Add end-to-end (E2E) browser tests (Playwright or Cypress) to cover real-browser flows (navigation, render correctness, and critical user journeys). If CI references Playwright (as in ci.yml), add Playwright config and E2E tests so CI can exercise them.
- Expand unit/integration tests to cover more of the codebase beyond app.ts/main.ts (scripts, config helpers, build helpers) or intentionally include more source files in coverage to avoid giving a false sense of 100% coverage for only a small subset.
- Incorporate tests into CI in a way that clearly separates unit/test failures from E2E failures and upload artifacts (coverage) with clear retention. Ensure CI actually runs any referenced E2E/test tooling (Playwright browsers) and that caching/configuration is correct for the chosen package manager.
- Consider adding smoke/integration tests for critical assets (e.g., public pages, accessibility checks with axe/jest-axe) and add test badges to README to communicate test health.
- Add test matrix runs (Node/browser versions) or at least document supported test environment(s) so contributors know how to run tests locally (node >=22 is already in engines).

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (85% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Execution is solid: the project builds successfully and the full test suite passes. Runtime/driving servers (preview/dev) could not be validated end-to-end in this environment (connection refused / spawn timeout), but the code shows basic runtime error handling and declared runtime dependencies are present.
- Unit/integration tests: npm run test completed successfully — 4 test files, 14 tests, 14 passed.
- Build: npm run build succeeded (TypeScript compile + Vite build). Output shows dist assets (dist/index.html and built JS/CSS assets).
- Preview server: npm run preview failed initially with spawnSync ETIMEDOUT; starting preview as a background process reported a PID but headless browser tests reported net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED when attempting to connect to http://localhost:5173.
- Dev server: npm run dev was started as a background process (PID reported) but the headless browser could not reach localhost:5173 (connection refused) in this environment.
- Runtime dependencies declared in package.json (@microsoft/clarity, gsap, three) and Node engine requirement (node >= 22.17.0) is explicit.
- Basic runtime error handling: src/app.ts checks for missing #app element and logs an error before returning (good defensive behavior).
- Health-check and maintenance scripts exist (scripts/health-check-utils.js) and are covered by tests demonstrating handling of edge cases.
- No failing tests, build errors, or test-time warnings observed in the test/build outputs captured here.

**Next Steps:**
- Reproduce the preview/dev server connectivity issue locally (or in CI) to confirm whether failures were environment-specific: run npm run preview and verify the server listens on the expected port (5173) and respond to HTTP requests.
- If preview/dev fails to start in CI, capture server logs and set a longer startup timeout; add a smoke-test that starts the built preview server and performs an HTTP health check before running browser tests.
- Add a small end-to-end / smoke test in CI that runs the production build, serves dist/, and performs an HTTP request to ensure the built site actually serves (this will catch serve/startup regressions).
- Consider instrumenting server start scripts to output a clear readiness message and log file (so automated runners can detect readiness).
- Document environment requirements for running dev/preview in CONTRIBUTING or README (e.g., required Node version, ports that must be free) and add a troubleshooting note for spawn/timeout errors.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (75% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Overall the repository has solid developer-facing documentation (README, developer setup guide, ADRs, library notes, SECURITY guidance) and the docs align with the codebase in most places (tests run, scripts described in README work). Missing elements: no changelog/release notes, no API reference, limited formal doc generation, and a stale/missing docs helper referenced in package.json which suggests a documentation-tooling gap.
- README.md exists and contains clear quick-start, run/build/test/lint/verify instructions.
- docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md provides a thorough, non-interactive developer setup and verification guide.
- Architectural documentation present: docs/decisions contains many accepted ADR markdown files documenting key choices.
- docs/libraries contains per-library documentation notes for many dependencies (helpful for maintainers).
- Security and audit artifacts: SECURITY.md, audit-summary.md and audit.json are present and explain triage actions.
- Codebase includes small inline comments and header comments in scripts and source files (e.g. src/main.ts, src/app.ts, scripts/health-check.js) but lacks comprehensive JSDoc for public APIs.
- Tests exist and pass: running `npm test` executed Vitest and reported all tests passing (4 files, 14 tests). This supports that documentation about running tests is accurate.
- package.json scripts broadly match README instructions (dev, build, test, lint, type-check, health-check, verify).
- No CHANGELOG.md or release notes file was found (no historical changelog/release notes in repository).
- No API reference or generated API docs (no API.md, no docs/api/ folder, and no doc generation tooling discovered).
- package.json contains scripts `docs:setup` and `docs:report` which invoke setup-package-docs.js, but the file `setup-package-docs.js` is not present in the repository (referenced script missing).

**Next Steps:**
- Add a changelog or RELEASE_NOTES.md (or adopt a CHANGELOG.md) and start recording releases or notable changes.
- Either add the missing docs helper (setup-package-docs.js) referenced by package.json or remove/update the `docs:setup` and `docs:report` scripts to avoid broken/opaque commands.
- Add an API reference (even minimal) documenting any exported functions/modules (e.g. JSDoc or a short docs/API.md). If there is intentionally no external API, state that in the README.
- Improve inline documentation for public modules/functions (add JSDoc comments to src/ and important scripts) so maintainers and automatic doc generators can consume them.
- Consider adding a top-level docs index (docs/README.md or docs/index.md) that links DEVELOPER-SETUP, ADRs, library notes, security guidance, and how to generate/update docs.
- Add a lightweight release process note to DEVELOPER-SETUP.md or README.md describing how to produce release notes and update the changelog during releases/PRs.
- Run/automate a docs verification step in CI (or remove stale docs scripts) so repository scripts remain consistent and documented.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (0% ± 20% COMPLETE)
- Assessment failed due to error: Assessment was cancelled
- Error occurred during DEPENDENCIES assessment: Assessment was cancelled

**Next Steps:**
- Check assessment system configuration
- Verify project accessibility

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (78% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- Overall the repository demonstrates solid basic security hygiene for a static website: there is an automated npm-audit workflow (that fails on high/critical), a local security script, a package-lock.json, and an explicit SECURITY.md. I found no hardcoded secrets in the codebase. Missing/weak areas include lack of SAST/CodeQL scanning, no automated dependency update tool (Dependabot/Renovate), no explicit secret-scanning workflow in CI, and limited runtime/hardening guidance (CSP/headers, hosting HTTPS configuration, branch protection evidence).
- GitHub Actions security workflow present: .github/workflows/security-audit.yml runs npm audit --json and uploads audit.json then runs .github/scripts/parse-audit.js which fails the job if any high/critical advisories are present.
- The audit parser is implemented at .github/scripts/parse-audit.js and explicitly exits non-zero when high/critical advisories exist.
- Included audit.json (repo root) shows no reported vulnerabilities (metadata.vulnerabilities: all zero). This is an actual artifact in the repo.
- package.json contains useful security-related scripts: "audit:fix" (npm audit fix --package-lock-only) and "security:local" (npm audit --json > audit.json && node .github/scripts/parse-audit.js audit.json).
- package-lock.json is present (checked) — ensures reproducible installs and that npm audit can operate against locked deps.
- No hardcoded secrets detected in repository source code based on repository scan (grep across repo for typical secret keywords returned no matches).
- repo-secrets-scan.txt and repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt exist in repo (indicating a secrets scan was performed) but the files are empty in the checked-in copy — this suggests redaction or that findings were removed before committing.
- CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) uses a GitHub secret VITE_SENTRY_DSN in env — good use of secrets rather than hardcoding; be cautious about not echoing secrets in logs.
- No CodeQL, Semgrep, or other SAST workflow found in .github/workflows — static/application code scanning is absent.
- No Dependabot/renovate config detected (no .github/dependabot.yml or similar) — repository lacks automated dependency update PRs.
- No explicit secret-scanning GitHub Action workflow (e.g., the official secret scanning, trufflehog, gitleaks) found in workflows; only local/redacted scan artifacts are present.
- No Dockerfile or container-related security scanning workflows present (may be fine for a static site but relevant if containers are introduced).
- No explicit Content Security Policy or security-related HTTP header configuration in repository (index.html minimal). Note: host configuration may be separate, but repo lacks guidance or automated checks.
- Repository is primarily a static site SPA; there is no server-side authentication/authorization code to evaluate.

**Next Steps:**
- Enable a SAST/code-scanning workflow (e.g., GitHub CodeQL or Semgrep) in .github/workflows to catch insecure code patterns and common vulnerabilities in JS/TS.
- Enable Dependabot or Renovate (add .github/dependabot.yml or equivalent) to receive automated dependency update PRs and reduce window of exposure to vulnerabilities.
- Add automated secret-scanning in CI (e.g., gitleaks, trufflehog, or GitHub advanced secret scanning) to detect accidental commits of secrets and ensure CI fails fast on accidental leaks.
- Ensure CI does not print secret values in logs (review workflows and steps that echo environment variables) and enforce use of repository secrets for all credentials.
- Add a basic CSP and security-related meta headers guidance (or automated checks) in the repo or deployment pipeline; if using a hosting platform, configure HTTPS and security headers at the host level.
- Add instructions to SECURITY.md describing how to report security issues and the process for dependency updates and secret rotation; include contact or security policy if applicable.
- Consider adding ESLint security plugins (eslint-plugin-security or similar) and a rule-set to catch risky JS patterns during linting.
- Periodically run and review npm audit results and consider adding automated scheduling of the security-audit workflow (e.g., weekly on: schedule) to catch new advisories quickly.
- If CI/build artifacts include third-party binaries (Playwright browsers, etc.), add caching/validation and consider adding SBOM generation and supply-chain checks for stronger provenance.
- Enable branch protection rules (required PR reviews, status checks) and consider enforcing signed commits and 2FA for repo maintainers if not already in place.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (78% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Version control is well-established with a clean commit history, conventional commit messages, CI workflows, pre-commit hooks and multiple remote branches. Minor issues reduce the score: the working directory is not clean (tracked transient files modified and an untracked transient file present), some CI/generated artifacts are tracked (exits.env, audit.json), and there's no .gitattributes file. Overall the repository is in good shape but should tidy tracked transient/state files and enforce ignore rules.
- Git repo present with 245 commits (git rev-list --count HEAD = 245) and recent activity on branches (HEAD on fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage).
- Commit messages follow conventional prefixes (ci:, chore:, feat:, docs:, fix:) and are generally descriptive (inspected git log --oneline and git log --pretty=format:%s).
- Branch structure: multiple local and remote branches exist (main, fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage, several cleanup/* branches) and origin remotes are present (git branch -a).
- Working directory is not clean: 'git status' shows modified tracked files .voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md and an untracked .voder/.processes.json (git status --porcelain output).
- Generated/CI artifacts are tracked in the repo: audit.json and exits.env are present in HEAD (git show HEAD:exits.env and reading audit.json). These look like CI-produced files (exits.env contains exit statuses, audit.json is npm audit output).
- .gitignore exists and is comprehensive for node/dev artifacts, but it does not ignore the .voder directory; .voder files appear tracked and modified (suggests repo contains local/system metadata).
- Husky pre-commit hook exists (.husky/pre-commit) and core.hooksPath is configured (.husky/_), running format:check, lint:check and type-check — hooks are check-only and will block bad commits locally if used.
- CI workflows are present and thorough (.github/workflows/ci.yml and security-audit.yml), they checkout and run npm ci, build, tests and upload artifacts — good automation integration.
- package-lock.json is tracked (good for reproducible installs). No other lockfile conflicts detected.
- .gitattributes is absent (no file found), which could be added for consistent line endings and export attributes.
- The repository contains a release-like tag (tag: v1.0.0-complete) visible in the log, indicating some release practices are used.

**Next Steps:**
- Clean the working directory: decide whether .voder/*.md files and .voder/.processes.json should be tracked. If they are local/state files, add .voder/ to .gitignore and remove them from the index: git rm --cached .voder/history.md .voder/last-action.md && git commit -m "chore: remove local voder state files from VCS".
- Remove transient CI artifacts from the repository if they are generated (exits.env, audit.json). If they should not be versioned: add them to .gitignore and remove from index (git rm --cached exits.env audit.json) and commit. If audit.json should be retained for history, document why.
- Add a .gitattributes file to ensure consistent eol handling and other attributes (e.g., '* text=auto') and commit it.
- Consider enforcing a policy to prevent committing generated/CI artifacts (pre-commit checks or CI lint step that fails the build if such files are staged).
- If desirable, enable commit-msg hook or a CI check to enforce conventional commit formatting (improves consistency for release tooling and automation).
- Optionally review the husky pre-commit script to ensure it blocks commits on failing checks (currently check-only; if you want auto-fix on commit, consider separate hooks or developer guidance).
