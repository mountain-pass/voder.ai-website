Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 67.0

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (76.38% ± 10% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
Overall the repository demonstrates strong execution, solid test infrastructure, and well-structured code with comprehensive documentation and ADRs. Unit testing and build workflows pass locally and the project is well-instrumented for CI artifacts. The primary blocker is the SECURITY assessment which did not complete (score 0) and prevents meeting the required thresholds; E2E verification and CI preview stability also need attention to guarantee reproducible Playwright runs in CI.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Perform a complete security assessment run (npm audit, SBOM verification, secret-scan triage) and resolve the failure that prevented the SECURITY evaluation; ensure e2e-stability artifacts are produced by CI to allow verification.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- This is a small static pre-launch website whose core functionality (rendering the page, application entry points, build, and automated tests) is implemented and working. The project has a clear main entry (src/main.ts), an app initializer (src/app.ts) that injects content into #app, a working build (vite) producing dist/, and a full test suite which passes locally. There are no server/API or CLI components to evaluate; those are not present in the repository.
- Main entry point: src/main.ts exists and imports ./app.js; it initializes the app on DOMContentLoaded or immediately depending on document.readyState.
- App logic: src/app.ts contains init() which finds #app and injects HTML content (heading, description, subtitle).
- HTML: index.html references /src/main.ts and includes <div id="app"></div> as the target element.
- Automated tests: vitest run completed successfully: 4 test files, 14 tests, 14 passed (output captured from npm test).
- Specific passing tests include: tests/main.test.ts, tests/coverage-increase.test.ts, tests/health-check-utils.test.ts, tests/prepare-libraries.test.ts — verifying DOM init behavior, health-check utilities, and library-prepare logic.
- Build: npm run build (tsc + vite build) completes successfully and outputs dist/index.html and assets (build output captured).
- Health-check utilities: scripts/health-check-utils.js implements parseVersion, compareSemver, and checkLockfileAndNodeModules; tests validate their behavior.
- NPM scripts: dev/build/preview/test/type-check and verify workflows are provided in package.json; dev uses vite (static site), preview serves dist.
- No API endpoints or server-side code present to validate; repository is a static frontend site.
- No CLI binary or command-line tool implemented beyond npm scripts.
- E2E: there are e2e-related config and scripts (Playwright dev deps and scripts) but no executed Playwright tests in this assessment; some e2e test files are ignored by .gitignore/.voderignore.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the dev server (npm run dev) and perform a manual smoke test in a browser to validate runtime rendering and third-party library behavior (three, gsap) in a real browser environment.
- Add/enable end-to-end Playwright tests (or ensure they run in CI) to validate the rendered UI and interactive behavior in a browser; add them to the verify pipeline.
- Add automated accessibility and visual regression checks (axe, Playwright snapshots) to guard UI regressions for the cinematic/animation features.
- If interactive animations are planned (three.js/gsap), add integration tests that exercise those flows and instrument performance checks.
- Document and/or add a simple deployment preview step (e.g., a script or CI job that runs npm run preview) so production-like bundles can be validated automatically.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (86% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Source code is small, well-structured and well-tested with a comprehensive linting/formatting configuration in place. Running the toolchain shows the TypeScript source and tests are clean (ESLint/Stylelint produced no runtime errors, Vitest all green with 100% coverage). The main quality issues are in repository documentation and some script files (Prettier/markdownlint errors).
- ESLint is configured via eslint.config.ts and a layered config in config/eslint (base, dx, performance). This is a modern TypeScript-aware flat ESLint setup using @typescript-eslint/parser + plugins (evidence: config/eslint/index.ts and config/eslint/base.ts).
- Prettier configuration exists (prettier.config.ts) and formatting scripts are present in package.json (format, format:check).
- stylelint configuration exists (stylelint.config.ts) and a lint:css script is defined.
- Running ESLint (npm run lint / npm run lint:check) produced no visible errors in the project files (no error output), implying the source files comply with the configured ruleset.
- Running tests (npm test) executed Vitest: 4 test files, 14 tests — all passed. Running coverage (npm run test:coverage) shows 100% coverage for the project source files (app.ts, main.ts).
- Prettier format check (npm run format:check) reported a code style issue: scripts/check-e2e-artifacts.js — Prettier recommends reformatting that file. (Evidence: format:check output showing '[warn] scripts/check-e2e-artifacts.js').
- Markdown lint (npm run lint:md) fails with many issues across docs/*.md (MD041, MD010, MD009, MD012, MD031, etc.). The failure is widespread across docs/libraries/* and README.md — indicates documentation files contain trailing spaces, hard tabs, wrong heading structure and other markdown style problems.
- stylelint (npm run lint:css) ran with no error output (no issues reported for src/style.css).
- Code organization: small, focused src/ directory (src/app.ts, src/main.ts, src/style.css) and tests/ directory with tests covering initialization and utilities. Naming and structure are consistent and idiomatic.
- Error handling in source is minimal but present: init() logs an error and returns if #app is missing (src/app.ts). For a small site this is acceptable, but more complex logic would warrant richer error handling and test cases.
- No obvious code duplication in the small codebase; functions are short and single-responsibility.

**Next Steps:**
- Run Prettier --write (npm run format) and commit changes to fix the reported formatting issue in scripts/check-e2e-artifacts.js.
- Fix markdownlint issues across docs (address hard tabs, trailing spaces, heading structure, fenced code block spacing). Consider running markdownlint-cli2 --fix where applicable and add the fix step to CI or a pre-commit hook.
- Ensure CI enforces format:check and lint:md (if not already) so documentation style regressions fail the build. The package.json already has a verify script referencing these steps — ensure CI calls the verify or the specific lint/format checks.
- Expand lint coverage if desired: run ESLint with type-aware rules where applicable and confirm no rule exemptions are hiding issues. Consider running eslint with --max-warnings=0 in CI (package.json already provides lint:check).
- Consider improving error handling for future complexity (throwing/propagating errors, using a logger abstraction) and add tests covering error paths (e.g., missing DOM container).
- If htmlhint config references built artifacts (htmlhint.config.js imports from ./dist), ensure the distribution build step or generated configs are present for any consumers of htmlhint to avoid runtime import errors in tooling.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (85% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Testing is well set up and the unit test suite (Vitest/jsdom) runs and passes locally with 100% coverage for the application entry/source files. E2E tests (Playwright) and CI workflows are present and wired into GitHub Actions, but Playwright tests require a running preview server and in-repo Playwright results show tests were skipped — E2E execution was not verified locally here. Overall the project demonstrates a good testing setup with minor gaps around validating E2E execution locally and expanding test coverage beyond the small set of runtime files.
- Test frameworks and tools present: vitest (unit tests, jsdom), @playwright/test (E2E), testing-library/jest-dom, happy-dom/jsdom and coverage provider @vitest/coverage-v8 (declared in package.json).
- Test files found: tests/*.test.ts (coverage-increase.test.ts, health-check-utils.test.ts, main.test.ts, prepare-libraries.test.ts) and tests/e2e/app.spec.ts (Playwright).
- Running npm test (vitest run) completed successfully: 4 test files, 14 tests — all passed locally (output captured).
- Coverage run (npm run test:coverage) produced v8 coverage report with 100% for app.ts and main.ts and overall coverage shown by vitest run output.
- Vitest configuration (vitest.config.ts and config/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts) sets up jsdom environment, setupFiles, coverage reporter (text/json/html) and default coverage thresholds (90%) — thresholds exist in the config factory.
- Playwright config (playwright.config.ts) and CI workflows (.github/workflows/ci.yml and e2e-stability.yml) are present and attempt to run E2E tests in CI (including preview server steps and browser installation).
- Playwright run artifact (playwright-results.json) shows the e2e test was present but marked as 'skipped' in the recorded results (no successful browser test run in this environment), indicating E2E needs the preview server/browser environment to be executed.
- CI is configured to run type-check, format, lint, build, unit tests with coverage, and E2E; the workflow collects logs and coverage artifacts.
- Unit tests include good test patterns (DOM setup/teardown, mocking fs and console where needed) and avoid writing repo files (use tmpdir).

**Next Steps:**
- Verify and run Playwright E2E tests locally by starting the preview server (npm run preview or build+preview) and running npx playwright test --local to confirm E2E stability outside CI. Add a documented local recipe for running E2E tests in the README.
- Ensure Playwright E2E tests are deterministic in CI: add a webServer configuration in playwright.config (or ensure scripts consistently start and wait for preview) so E2E tests are less likely to be skipped/flaky.
- Expand unit/integration test coverage to exercise more runtime scripts and library code beyond app.ts/main.ts (many source files are excluded from current coverage by configuration).
- Add CI assertions or badges for test coverage if required by project policy, and ensure coverage thresholds are enforced in CI (the configuration provides thresholds, but confirm the CI run fails when thresholds are not met).
- Add periodic health checks for flaky tests (e.g., retry policies, capture trace/video on failure) and consider running Playwright in a single browser project in dev to speed local iteration.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (90% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- The project shows strong execution: dependencies install, type-check, lint/format, unit tests, and a production build all succeed. The app initializes correctly in tests and the build outputs assets. One issue occurred running the preview server in this environment (spawn ETIMEDOUT), likely environmental rather than a code defect.
- npm ci completed successfully and project dependencies were prepared via scripts/prepare-libraries.js.
- Node engine requirement satisfied (package.json: >=22.17.0; runtime: v22.17.1).
- Unit tests passed: Vitest reported 4 test files and 14 tests all passing.
- TypeScript type-check (tsc --noEmit) completed with no errors.
- ESLint initially reported 8 warnings; running npm run lint:fix then npm run lint:check resulted in zero warnings (health-check passes).
- Prettier format was run and subsequent format check passed.
- Health-check script (node scripts/health-check.js) completed successfully, validating type-check, lint and format steps.
- Production build (npm run build using Vite) completed successfully and produced dist/ assets.
- Runtime initialization logic includes guard/error logging for missing #app element and is covered by tests (init() populates DOM).
- Attempting to run npm run preview (vite preview) failed with a spawn ETIMEDOUT in this environment; build itself had already succeeded.

**Next Steps:**
- Retry 'npm run preview' in another environment or increase command spawn timeout to confirm that Vite preview serves the built site correctly (likely an environment/process issue).
- Run end-to-end tests with Playwright (e2e) against the preview or a deployed build to validate runtime behavior and catch regressions in a browser context.
- Add a smoke/integration test that starts the preview server and requests index.html to ensure end-to-end serving works in CI.
- Consider providing a Dockerfile or a simple wrapper script for consistent preview/serve behavior in CI to avoid environment-specific spawn/timeouts.
- Document the use of experimental Node flags (NODE_OPTIONS="--experimental-strip-types") and any CI implications; remove or update when the feature stabilizes.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is high-quality and developer-focused: there is a clear README with setup/build/test instructions, a developer setup guide, an extensive set of architectural decision records (ADRs) and per-library docs. Missing or weak areas are a formal changelog/release notes, explicit API documentation (none found), and limited inline code docstrings/comments. A few docs files are empty/minimal and I could not run the test suite here to validate generated docs/coverage artifacts.
- README.md exists at repository root and contains clear Quick start, build, test, lint, and verification instructions (references to npm scripts, Node engine requirement).
- package.json exposes comprehensive scripts (dev, build, test, test:coverage, lint, format, verify, health-check, prepare, security:local) that match instructions in README and docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md.
- docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md provides a reproducible developer verification sequence (type-check, lint autofix, lint check, format, build, tests + coverage) with troubleshooting notes — good operational documentation for contributors.
- docs/decisions/ contains many Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) (0000..0024 etc.) documenting architecture/process choices; good evidence of recorded design rationale.
- docs/libraries/ contains many markdown pages documenting libraries and dependencies (e.g., vite.md, typescript.md, vitest.md, eslint.md), which helps onboard maintainers and reviewers.
- SECURITY.md exists and documents automated scans, artifacts, and triage guidance; audit-summary.md and ci-audit-summary.md present concise audit results.
- There is test code (tests/*.ts) and an app entry (src/app.ts) with minimal inline comment; tests are referenced in docs and README, but I did not run them here because dependency installation (npm ci) is required to execute the suite in this environment.
- No explicit CHANGELOG or RELEASE_NOTES file was found (no files matching CHANGELOG* or changelog*).
- No API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI spec, API.md, or detailed endpoint/interface docs) was found. This may be acceptable for a static pre-launch website, but if the project exposes an API this is a gap.
- Code-level documentation is sparse: source files are small and lack JSDoc/TSDoc docstrings or richer inline documentation (src/app.ts has a single-line comment).
- Some docs files appear empty or minimal (docs/CI-AUDIT.md and docs/E2E-REPRO.md are empty), indicating areas intended for content that haven't been populated.
- CI workflows are present under .github/workflows (ci.yml, security-audit.yml, e2e-stability.yml, secret-scan.yml, code-scanning.yml), but there are no documentation badges (e.g., build/test coverage) in the README describing current CI status.

**Next Steps:**
- Add a CHANGELOG.md (or follow 'Keep a changelog' format) to document releases and notable changes; link/update it during releases.
- If the project exposes any runtime API, add explicit API documentation (API.md or OpenAPI) describing endpoints, request/response formats, and examples. If not applicable, add a short note in README stating there is no API.
- Populate the currently-empty docs files (docs/CI-AUDIT.md, docs/E2E-REPRO.md) or remove placeholders if not needed.
- Add inline code documentation where helpful (JSDoc/TSDoc) for modules and exported functions to aid maintainability (e.g., annotate exported functions in src/ and any non-trivial logic).
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines, branch/PR workflow, commit message conventions, and how to run the verify sequence locally to help new contributors.
- Consider adding release/repo badges (build status, test coverage, security scan) to README so readers can quickly assess repository health.
- Add a brief architectural overview diagram or one-page ARCHITECTURE.md that references the ADRs and shows component boundaries for quicker onboarding.
- Automate generation or verification of documentation artifacts in CI (e.g., ensure docs are built/validated, or add a docs:check step) and document that in README/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md.
- When possible, run the verify sequence locally (npm ci && npm run verify) and update docs with any artifacts that result (coverage/index.html location, audit artifacts) so documentation and repository state remain in sync.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are well-managed: package.json and a package-lock.json are present, Dependabot is enabled, npm audit (local and CI artifacts) reports zero vulnerabilities, and installed deps are visible. The main gaps are an inability to run an outdated check in this environment and a large number of devDependencies which increase surface area to monitor.
- package.json is present and declares runtime dependencies (@microsoft/clarity, gsap, three) and a comprehensive set of devDependencies (eslint, vitest, typescript, vite, etc.).
- A package-lock.json exists in the repository (git ls-files shows package-lock.json), which enables reproducible installs. The file could not be read here due to ignore/filtering but its presence is confirmed.
- npm audit (run here) returned an empty vulnerabilities object; audit.json and ci-audit.json in the repo also show 0 critical/high/moderate/low/info findings (audit-summary.md and ci-audit-summary.md confirm).
- npm ls --depth=0 succeeded and shows the top-level installed packages matching package.json (evidence of dependencies being installed in the environment where commands were run).
- Dependabot is configured (.github/dependabot.yml) to run weekly for npm and open dependency PRs, providing automatic update coverage.
- There are many devDependencies (audit metadata: ~739-743 dev deps), increasing the surface area that needs maintenance and monitoring.
- npm outdated failed to run in this execution environment (command returned an error), so an up-to-date list of outdated packages could not be produced here.
- The repo includes scripts and CI tooling to run audits and parse results (.github/scripts/parse-audit.js and npm scripts: "security:local", "audit:fix").
- The project uses caret ranges (^) in package.json, which is standard but allows minor/patch updates that may introduce regressions; the lockfile provides exact resolution for installs.

**Next Steps:**
- Run npm outdated (locally or in CI) to get a current list of packages with available updates and prioritize updating critical runtime deps (here runtime deps are few).
- Add a CI job that fails the build if dependencies have known high/critical vulnerabilities and regularly runs npm audit (there is existing support; ensure it's enabled in CI pipeline).
- Consider trimming devDependencies if possible to reduce maintenance surface (audit metadata shows a very large dev dependency tree).
- Verify package-lock.json is committed and maintained (git shows it is present) and ensure CI uses npm ci to install exactly the locked versions.
- If you want stricter dependency versioning for critical runtime libs, consider pinning exact versions or using shrinkwrap + automated dependency updates and review PRs from Dependabot weekly.
- Investigate why npm outdated failed in this environment (network, registry auth, or environment policy) and ensure tooling to surface outdated packages is available in CI/developer workflows.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (0% ± 20% COMPLETE)
- Assessment failed due to error: 400 Input tokens exceed the configured limit of 272000 tokens. Your messages resulted in 291448 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages.
- Error occurred during SECURITY assessment: 400 Input tokens exceed the configured limit of 272000 tokens. Your messages resulted in 291448 tokens. Please reduce the length of the messages.

**Next Steps:**
- Check assessment system configuration
- Verify project accessibility

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (82% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Version control is well-established and healthy: a substantive commit history (~288 commits) with consistent, descriptive commit messages (conventional style), active branches and remotes, a comprehensive .gitignore, and pre-commit hooks. Minor issues: the working tree is not clean (two tracked .voder files are modified), there are many ignored/untracked transient files present in the working copy, and a few repo-internal automation artifacts (.voder/*) are tracked which may be unintended.
- git status --porcelain -b shows the current branch is fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage and tracked modifications: .voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md (both marked M).
- git rev-list --count HEAD reports 288 commits in the repository (substantial history).
- git log --oneline (recent entries) shows well-formed, scoped commit messages (examples: 'ci(e2e): e2e orchestration - improved run-e2e.sh...', 'test(e2e): add explicit wait for #app...', 'docs: add E2E reproduction guide'); commit messages follow a consistent conventional-style format.
- git shortlog -s -n --all shows main committers: Tom Howard (190 commits) and voder-bot (99 commits), indicating both human and automated contributions.
- Branch layout includes local branches and remote tracking branches (e.g., remotes/origin/main, remotes/origin/fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage); current branch tracks origin/fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage.
- .gitignore is present and comprehensive (ignores node_modules/, build outputs, logs, coverage, .env files, temporary folders, etc.).
- .husky is present and a tracked pre-commit hook exists (.husky/pre-commit). The hook runs format:check, lint:check, and type-check — good gate for commit quality.
- Many transient files are present but correctly ignored/untracked (git ls-files --others --exclude-standard -i returned .env, node_modules/, various logs and tmp artifacts).
- Some internal automation / metadata under .voder/ are tracked (git ls-files .voder shows .voder/.processes.json, .voder/history.md, .voder/last-action.md, etc.) — these files are currently tracked and two are modified in the working tree.
- Local git config for user.name and user.email returns voder-bot / voder-bot@example.com (this may be the environment default); however commit history shows many commits authored by Tom Howard, so author identity varies across commits.

**Next Steps:**
- Clean the working tree: commit or stash the modifications to .voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md (or revert them if they shouldn't be tracked) to return to a clean working directory before creating releases or switching branches.
- Review whether .voder/ files should be tracked. If .voder contains ephemeral or sensitive automation state, add .voder/ to .gitignore and remove the tracked files from the repository (git rm --cached ...) and, if necessary, remove from history with a vetted procedure (git filter-repo or BFG) after confirming no secrets were committed.
- Consider adding a commit-msg hook (or CI check) to enforce the existing conventional commit style automatically (tools: commitlint + Husky or similar) to maintain message quality.
- Verify git user configuration for CI/bots vs human authors. Ensure CI/bot commits have a clear author identity and that personal developer commits are made with correct user.name/user.email to avoid attribution confusion.
- Enable/verify branch protection rules on the remote (main) to require passing CI and enforce PR reviews. Ensure the CI workflows referenced in commits are active on the remote and enforce status checks.
- Run a quick secrets scan (e.g., truffleHog/gitleaks) on the repository to ensure no sensitive values were committed, especially because .voder and other automation files are tracked.
