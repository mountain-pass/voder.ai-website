## Critical Blocking Issues



### Story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION - FAILED**CRITICAL FINDINGS**:

**Status**: FAILED (3 failed, 7 passed acceptance criteria)

- Story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION has FAILED acceptance criteria validation

**Failed Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **AC2 - Deployment Blocking**: Failed GitHub Actions do NOT prevent Vercel deployment to production- Multiple deployment failures detected in production## Executive Summary**Assessment Time**: 10:45 UTC+10:00

   - **Evidence**: Recent GitHub Actions failures (CI exit code 4, Deploy exit code 1) but Vercel deployments still occurred

   - **Impact**: Critical protection mechanism not functioning- Missing rollback capability implementation  

   

2. **AC8 - Fast Feedback**: Deployment does NOT start only after successful CI completion- Unable to verify successful deployment workflows

   - **Evidence**: Failed CI still leads to deployment attempts, indicating ineffective feedback loop

   - **Impact**: Quality gates are not enforcing deployment standards

   

3. **AC9 - Rollback Capability**: Failed deployments cannot be quickly rolled back## TRACEABILITY ASSESSMENT RESULTSThe assessment has identified a **BLOCKING ISSUE** that prevents continuation to new story development. Story 021.2-DEV-CI-SECURITY contains a failed acceptance criteria (AC2: Secret Scanning) that must be resolved before proceeding.**Assessor**: GitHub Copilot (AI Assistant)**Assessment Date**: 2025-09-22  

   - **Evidence**: Multiple failed deployments visible in `vercel ls` but no rollback mechanism implemented

   - **Impact**: No recovery mechanism for deployment failures



**Passed Acceptance Criteria**: AC1, AC3, AC4, AC5, AC6, AC7, AC10### Phase 1: Fail-Fast Story Validation

## BLOCKING ISSUES SUMMARY

**Story**: 021.2-DEV-CI-SECURITY  

### Critical Deployment Failures (Story 022.0)

1. **Production Deployment Errors**: Recent deployments showing "Error" status in Vercel**Failed Criteria**: AC2 - Secret Scanning  ## Traceability Results- **Assessment Method**: Fail-fast validation starting with highest numbered story

2. **Site Accessibility**: Production site returning HTTP 401 (unauthorized)

3. **Missing Rollback**: No rollback capability implemented or documented**Root Cause**: Gitleaks action requires license for organization repositories  

4. **Incomplete Validation**: Cannot verify successful deployment workflows due to current failures

**Error**: "missing gitleaks license. Go grab one at gitleaks.io and store it as a GitHub Secret named GITLEAKS_LICENSE"### Phase 1: Traceability Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETED  

### Dependencies

- Story 022.0 depends on stories 014.0, 021.1, 021.2, 021.3, 001.1

- Cannot validate dependent stories due to fail-fast process stopping at 022.0

**Impact**: Security vulnerability - unable to scan for committed secrets/credentials- Applied fail-fast reverse validation starting with highest numbered story (022.0)

## Assessment Evidence

## Blocking Issues  - ‚ùå AC3: Deployment Success Verification - `which vercel` returns "vercel not found"

### Deployment Protection Configuration ‚úÖ VERIFIED

- `vercel.json`: Deployment protection enabled with required status checks

- GitHub Actions: CI workflows properly named and configured

- Emergency override workflow: Available for critical fixes### Primary Blocker: E2E Stability Monitoring System Failure### ‚úÖ VALIDATED Criteria (7/10)  - ‚è∏Ô∏è AC4-AC9: Not validated (stopped per fail-fast methodology)

- Status monitoring: Scripts functional and reporting correctly



### Recent Deployment Status ‚ö†Ô∏è CONCERNING  

```**Issue**: The e2e-stability.yml workflow is systematically failing with "workflow file issue" errors, preventing any stability monitoring from occurring.- AC1: Quality Gate Integration (Vercel + GitHub Actions)

vercel ls output:

  Age     Status      Environment     Duration     

  9m      ‚óè Error     Production      39s          

  13h     ‚óè Error     Production      44s          **Impact**: - AC2: Deployment Blocking (Failed CI prevents deployments)  ### Other Stories (Not Validated)

  2d      ‚óè Ready     Production      24s          

```- No nightly stability monitoring



### Quality Validation Results ‚úÖ ALL PASSING- No trend analysis or historical data collection- AC3: Deployment Success Verification (Vercel CLI tools functional)Per fail-fast methodology, validation stopped at first failed criteria. The following stories were not assessed:

- **Type Check**: ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors

- **Linting**: ‚úÖ Zero warnings (strict mode)- No production environment health validation

- **Formatting**: ‚úÖ All files properly formatted

- **Tests**: ‚úÖ 97/97 tests passing- Missing early warning system for stability degradation- AC4: Trunk-Based Compatibility (Direct commits allowed)- Story 021.4-DEV-CI-STABILITY

- **Coverage**: ‚úÖ 92.37% coverage

- **Security**: ‚úÖ No vulnerabilities

- **Build**: ‚úÖ Production build successful

- **Health Check**: ‚úÖ Production site responding (338ms)**Evidence**:- AC6: Manual Override (Emergency deployment workflow exists)- Story 021.3-DEV-CI-DEPLOY  



## Risk Assessment- All recent workflow runs show 0s duration and immediate failure



### High Risk ‚ö†Ô∏è- Stability data files show zeros for all metrics (total: 144, passed: 0, failed: 0, flaky: 0)- AC7: Status Visibility (CLI status reporting functional)- Story 021.2-DEV-CI-SECURITY

- **Deployment failures may impact founder validation sessions**

- **Story 022.0 deployment protection not functioning as designed**- No scheduled runs executing successfully

- **Unknown root cause of deployment errors**

- AC10: Vercel CLI Status Verification (Tools operational)- Story 021.1-DEV-CI-CORE

### Medium Risk

- None identified## Next Required Actions



### Low Risk  

- Minor uncommitted changes in .voder directory (assessment artifacts)

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix e2e-stability.yml workflow execution issues

## Recommendations

2. **VALIDATE**: Ensure stability monitoring works correctly in all modes (scheduled, manual)### ‚ùå UNVALIDATED Criteria (3/10)## Blocking Issue Analysis

### Immediate Actions Required üö®

1. **INVESTIGATE DEPLOYMENT ERRORS**3. **VERIFY**: Confirm production environment validation is working

   - Access Vercel dashboard to review deployment error logs

   - Identify root cause of recent deployment failures4. **TEST**: Validate trend analysis and historical data collection- AC5: Preview deployment behavior unknown

   - Verify if errors are CI-related or Vercel platform issues

5. **RE-ASSESS**: Re-run assessment starting from 021.4-DEV-CI-STABILITY after fixes

2. **VALIDATE DEPLOYMENT PROTECTION** 

   - Test deployment protection with intentional CI failures- AC8: Deployment timing after successful CI unknown### Root Cause

   - Confirm failed GitHub Actions properly block deployment

   - Verify manual override functionality works correctly## Assessment Methodology



3. **VERIFY ROLLBACK CAPABILITIES**- AC9: Rollback procedures not verifiedStory 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION was recently updated to require actual CLI verification using Vercel CLI commands (`vercel ls` and `vercel inspect`), but the development environment does not have the Vercel CLI installed.

   - Test rollback mechanisms for failed deployments

   - Ensure monitoring alerts work for deployment failures- **Validation Approach**: Fail-fast reverse-order story validation

   - Validate deployment status reporting accuracy

- **Evidence Sources**: GitHub Actions, Vercel CLI, configuration files, workflow execution

### Next Assessment Cycle

- **Timeline**: After deployment issues resolved and story 022.0 completed- **Tools Used**: `gh` CLI, `vercel` CLI, file system inspection

- **Focus**: Complete reverse-order story validation from 021.4 downward

- **Criteria**: Zero blocking deployment issues- **Validation Depth**: Complete acceptance criteria verification with concrete evidence## Evidence Gathered### Specific Failure



## Conclusion



**ASSESSMENT OUTCOME**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKED - NOT READY FOR NEW STORY DEVELOPMENT**## Conclusion- **AC3**: "Deployment Success Verification - Push to main branch triggers deployment and verifies successful completion using Vercel CLI (`vercel ls` and `vercel inspect`)"



**PRIMARY BLOCKER**: Story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION has unresolved deployment failures that could impact founder validation experiences.



**QUALITY STATUS**: All quality gates pass except deployment reliability.**STATUS**: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - Not ready for new story development### Technical Infrastructure Status- **System Check**: `which vercel` returns "vercel not found"



**NEXT ACTIONS**: 

1. Resolve deployment errors in production

2. Complete story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION  The project cannot proceed to new story development until the critical E2E stability monitoring failures are resolved. While deployment protection (022.0) is fully functional, the stability monitoring system (021.4) has systematic issues that prevent reliable operation.- **Vercel Configuration**: ‚úÖ Properly configured with deployment protection- **Impact**: Cannot validate deployment success without required CLI tools

3. Re-run assessment to verify resolution

4. Only proceed with new story development after CLEAR status



**CRITICAL RULE ENFORCED**: No new story development until ALL current stories are 100% complete and operational.**RECOMMENDATION**: Address the e2e-stability workflow execution issues before continuing with any new development work.- **GitHub Actions Integration**: ‚úÖ Required status checks configured correctly  



---- **CLI Tools**: ‚úÖ Both `vercel` and `gh` CLI tools operational### Available Evidence (Partial Validation)



*Assessment conducted using fail-fast reverse validation methodology as specified in assess.prompt.md*  - **Emergency Override**: ‚úÖ Workflow exists and configured- vercel.json has correct deployment protection configuration

*Report generated: 2025-09-22 10:45 UTC+10:00*
- **Recent Deployment Evidence**: ‚úÖ Failed CI correctly blocked deployment- GitHub Actions workflows exist with matching names ("CI & Playwright multi-browser tests", "Deploy to Production", "Security Audit")

- Emergency override workflow exists at .github/workflows/emergency-override.yml

### Quality Gates Functioning- GitHub CLI is available for workflow verification (`which gh` found at /usr/local/bin/gh)

- Failed CI runs (17893023590, 17893023594) correctly prevented production deployment

- Vercel deployment (dpl_ERupw7bKCkHZ8Sg3V3RMKgR1Z8wV) shows "Error" status as expected## Required Actions

- Status check integration working as designed

### Immediate Action Required

## Next Required Actions**Install Vercel CLI** to enable required deployment verification:



### Immediate Actions Needed```bash

1. **Test Preview Deployments**: Create test PR to verify preview deployments work independently of protection rules# Option 1: Install globally via npm

2. **Measure Fast Feedback**: Time deployment start after successful CI completionnpm install -g vercel

3. **Verify Rollback Capabilities**: Document and test rollback procedures for failed deployments

# Option 2: Install locally as dev dependency

### Acceptance Criteria Completion Strategynpm install --save-dev vercel

1. Create test pull request to validate AC5 (preview deployments)

2. Monitor next successful CI run to validate AC8 (timing)# Option 3: Use npx for one-time usage

3. Research and document Vercel rollback procedures for AC9npx vercel --version

```

## Assessment Conclusion

### Alternative Solutions

**RECOMMENDATION**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT START NEW STORY DEVELOPMENT**1. **Modify AC3 requirements** to use existing `npm run deploy:status` script instead of direct Vercel CLI

2. **Add Vercel CLI installation** to development setup documentation

**Rationale**: 3. **Create wrapper scripts** that provide the required verification functionality

- Core deployment protection story (022.0) remains incomplete

- 30% of acceptance criteria unvalidated (3/10)### Validation Methodology

- Missing validation affects production reliability and emergency procedures- Individual story traceability with fail-fast approach

- Risk of production issues if rollback capabilities are not verified- Stopped at first FAILED acceptance criteria per methodology

- Complete assessment will resume after blocking issue resolution

**Time to Resolution**: Estimated 2-4 hours to complete remaining validation tasks

## Readiness Determination

## Assessment Methodology Applied

**‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - NOT READY FOR NEW STORY DEVELOPMENT**

**Phase 0**: ‚úÖ Setup completed - cleaned existing assessment artifacts

**Phase 1**: ‚úÖ Traceability setup completed - fail-fast validation initiated  **Blocking Conditions Present**:

**Phase 2**: ‚è≠Ô∏è Skipped - fail-fast triggered by blocking issues in Phase 1- ‚ùå Story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION has FAILED acceptance criteria (AC3)

**Phase 3**: ‚úÖ Assessment report generation completed- ‚ùå Missing required CLI tools for deployment verification

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Additional stories not validated due to fail-fast methodology

**Validation Approach**: Fail-fast starting with story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION as highest numbered active story. Blocking issues identified immediately, preventing need for full assessment cycle.

**Assessment Coverage**: Validation stopped at story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION per fail-fast methodology. Complete assessment required after resolving AC3 failure.

*Assessment completed following instructions from assess.prompt.md***Next Steps**: 
1. Resolve Vercel CLI availability issue
2. Re-validate AC3 for story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION  
3. Complete validation of remaining acceptance criteria (AC4-AC9)
4. Continue fail-fast assessment with remaining stories

## Validation Evidence Summary

**Traceability Files Generated**: 1 file (022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION-traceability.md)
**Assessment Status**: Incomplete due to fail-fast blocking
**Critical Finding**: CLI tool dependency not met
**Resolution Required**: Install Vercel CLI or modify acceptance criteria
