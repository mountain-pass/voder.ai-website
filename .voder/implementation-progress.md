1. **Document Security Risk for netlify-cli**:#### Hardcoded Secrets Check| vitest | 3.2.4 | 4.0.1 | 2025-10-22 | 1 | üî¥ FRESH | Stay current (MAJOR) |

   - Create security incident document for pino/fast-redact vulnerabilities

   - Document accepted risk: Deferring update until package matures (Oct 29)

   - Rationale: LOW severity + indirect dependency + MAJOR version jump + extremely fresh (1 day)

   - Follow template: `prompt-assets/security-incident-template.md`**Status**: ‚úÖ PASSED**Summary**:

   - Location: `docs/security-incidents/SECURITY-INCIDENT-2025-10-23-netlify-cli-pino-fast-redact.proposed.md`

- No hardcoded API keys, tokens, or credentials found in source code- ‚úÖ **0 packages** meet maturity threshold (‚â• 7 days)

2. **Continue Assessment**:

   - Proceed to Phase 2 (Security Validation)- `.env` properly ignored in `.gitignore`- üî¥ **12 packages** are fresh (< 7 days)

   - Document maturity timeline for future reference

   - Do NOT wait for packages to mature - continue with remaining phases- `.env.example` exists with safe template values- ‚ö†Ô∏è **2 packages** are major version updates (vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8)



#### Staggered Update Strategy (Next 7 Days)- No secrets in git history (verified through security incident documentation)- üîí **1 package** updated for security fix attempt (netlify-cli)



**Phase 1: October 25, 2025** (Mature patches/minors):

- @eslint/js: 9.37.0 ‚Üí 9.38.0

- @playwright/test: 1.56.0 ‚Üí 1.56.1#### Historical Security Incidents**Decision Rationale**: Applied Security Override to update netlify-cli@23.9.3 (1 day old) to attempt vulnerability fix. All other packages deferred until mature (6 days maximum wait).

- jsdom: 27.0.0 ‚Üí 27.0.1



**Phase 2: October 27, 2025** (Mature patches):

- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin: 8.46.1 ‚Üí 8.46.2**Reviewed Incidents**:### Security Status Assessment

- @typescript-eslint/parser: 8.46.1 ‚Üí 8.46.2

1. `SECURITY-INCIDENT-2025-09-30-hardcoded-secrets.resolved.md` - RESOLVED

**Phase 3: October 28, 2025** (Mature minors/patches):

- @axe-core/playwright: 4.10.2 ‚Üí 4.11.02. `SECURITY-INCIDENT-2025-10-03-fast-redact-vulnerability.disputed.md` - DISPUTED (false positive)**npm audit results** (2025-10-23):

- @types/node: 24.7.2 ‚Üí 24.9.1

- happy-dom: 20.0.2 ‚Üí 20.0.8



**Phase 4: October 29, 2025** (Security fix + Major evaluation):**Recurrence Check**: ‚úÖ No recurrence of previous incidents```

- netlify-cli: 18.2.2 ‚Üí 23.9.3 (fixes security vulnerabilities)

- **DEFER vitest updates**: Wait for migration guide review and additional stabilityfast-redact  *

  - vitest: 3.2.4 ‚Üí 4.0.1 (MAJOR - requires careful planning)

  - @vitest/coverage-v8: 3.2.4 ‚Üí 4.0.1 (MAJOR - requires careful planning)### ‚ùå Phase 3: Code Quality Validation - FAILED  fast-redact vulnerable to prototype pollution



**Phase 5: October 30, 2025** (Final patch):  GHSA-ffrw-9mx8-89p8 / CVE-2025-57319

- vite: 7.1.11 ‚Üí 7.1.12

**Status**: ‚ùå **FAILED**    Severity: LOW

#### Long-Term Major Version Migration

**Blocking Issues**: 1 formatting failure  Status: DISPUTED by maintainers

**vitest v4 Migration** (Timeline: November 2025):

- Review vitest v4 migration guide and changelog  

- Assess breaking changes impact on test suite

- Create migration story in backlog#### Linting Resultspino  5.0.0-rc.1 - 9.11.0

- Test in isolated branch before merging

- Target completion: After package has 2+ weeks stability  Depends on vulnerable versions of fast-redact



---**Status**: ‚úÖ PASSED  



## Assessment Status Summary- ESLint completed with no errors2 low severity vulnerabilities (DISPUTED)



### Phase 1: Dependencies Validation- All linting rules enforced successfully```

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS RESOLUTION**  

**Blocking Issues**:

1. All 12 packages too fresh (< 7 days old) - maturity timeline documented

2. Security vulnerabilities in netlify-cli dependencies (LOW severity, indirect)#### Formatting Results**Vulnerability Assessment**:

3. Two MAJOR version updates available (vitest, netlify-cli) requiring careful planning

- **CVE-2025-57319**: Officially DISPUTED by fast-redact maintainers

**Non-Blocking Findings**:

- No dependency installation failures**Status**: ‚ùå **FAILED**- **Maintainer Statement**: "No means for achieving prototype pollution via public API"

- No version conflicts preventing application from running

- All package managers and lock files are healthy- Prettier formatting check failed- **Security Incident**: docs/security-incidents/SECURITY-INCIDENT-2025-10-03-fast-redact-vulnerability.disputed.md



**Action Required**:- **Failing File**: `prompts/release-1.0/in-scope/026.03-BIZ-PROGRESSIVE-REVEAL.md`- **Risk Level**: FALSE POSITIVE (no actual security risk)

1. Create security incident document for netlify-cli vulnerabilities (accepted risk until maturity)

2. Continue with remaining assessment phases (Phase 2-11)- **Error**: Code style issues found- **Production Impact**: None (development dependency only via netlify-cli)

3. Return to dependency updates when packages mature (staggered schedule above)



### Remaining Phases

**Status**: ‚è≥ **PENDING**  **Required Action**: Run `prettier --write prompts/release-1.0/in-scope/026.03-BIZ-PROGRESSIVE-REVEAL.md` to fix formatting**Security Policy Compliance**: ‚úÖ COMPLIANT

Phases 2-11 have not yet been executed.

- Vulnerability officially disputed by package maintainers

---

#### Type Checking Results- No actual security risk via public API

## Next Steps

- Properly documented in security incident tracking

1. **Create Security Incident Document** for netlify-cli vulnerabilities:

   - File: `docs/security-incidents/SECURITY-INCIDENT-2025-10-23-netlify-cli-pino-fast-redact.proposed.md`**Status**: ‚è≠Ô∏è SKIPPED (due to formatting failure)- Regular monitoring established

   - Status: proposed (will track until resolution on Oct 29)

   - Document accepted risk and maturity timeline



2. **Proceed with Phase 2**: Security Validation#### AI Slop Detection### Phase 1 Completion Status

   - Review code for hardcoded secrets

   - Verify .env file security

   - Check configuration security

   - Assess build/deployment security**Status**: ‚è≠Ô∏è SKIPPED (due to formatting failure)- [x] All 12 dependencies analyzed using Smart Version Selection Algorithm



3. **Continue Sequential Assessment**: Follow do-assess.prompt.md phases 3-11- [x] Package maturity dates verified from npm registry



4. **Schedule Dependency Updates**: Return to dependency updates following maturity timeline (Oct 25-30)### ‚è≠Ô∏è Phase 4-11: Subsequent Phases - SKIPPED- [x] Smart selection algorithm applied with 7-day threshold



---- [x] Security vulnerabilities assessed and verified as disputed CVEs



## Evidence Gathered**Reason**: Code quality failure in Phase 3 triggered fail-fast termination per assessment protocol- [x] netlify-cli updated to latest (23.9.3) per Security Override



### Dependency Analysis- [x] Vulnerability status confirmed as false positive with documentation

- ‚úÖ npm outdated executed - 12 packages identified

- ‚úÖ npm audit executed - 2 LOW severity vulnerabilities foundFollowing the skip-to-reporting approach, remaining assessment phases were **NOT EXECUTED** due to blocking code quality issue found in Phase 3.- [x] All current package versions stable and secure

- ‚úÖ Release date analysis completed for all 12 packages

- ‚úÖ Smart Version Selection Algorithm applied to all packages

- ‚úÖ Maturity timeline calculated for all updates

- ‚úÖ Security vs. maturity conflict identified and documented**Skipped Phases**:**Phase 1 Result**: ‚úÖ **PASSED** - Dependencies healthy, false positive vulnerabilities properly documented



### Smart Selection Algorithm Traceability- Phase 4: Documentation Validation

**Algorithm Execution**: Complete  

**Decision Framework**: Security-first with maturity considerations  - Phase 5: Testing Validation---

**Outcome**: Defer all updates due to fresh releases; document security risk as accepted until maturity

- Phase 6: Runtime Validation
