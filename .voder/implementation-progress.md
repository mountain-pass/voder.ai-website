Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 59.2

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (84% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
Overall the project is in a strong state: unit tests, linting, ADRs, and CI automation are present and functioning. Key gaps remain in reproducible dependency management, CI e2e artifact orchestration, and a few execution/version-control housekeeping items that must be resolved before declaring COMPLETE.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Make dependency installs reproducible by committing a package-lock.json (or chosen lockfile), ensure CI uses `npm ci`, and verify run-e2e.sh produces and uploads e2e artifacts (preview.out, playwright-results.json, e2e-stability.json) in the same job.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The repository implements a small static pre-launch website with clear entry points, a testable init function, a working build, and a green test suite. There is no backend or API to evaluate; preview/start of a local server timed out in this environment but the production build was produced successfully and unit tests passed.
- Main entry points exist and were inspected: src/main.ts (bootstraps the app) and src/app.ts (exported init() renders the #app content).
- index.html loads /src/main.ts and contains the <div id="app"></div> where init() injects content.
- Unit tests executed: npm test -> Vitest ran 4 test files, 14 tests passed (no failures). Output shows all tests passed.
- Build executed successfully: npm run build produced a dist/ containing index.html and built assets (Vite build succeeded).
- The app's core runtime behavior (rendering the Voder heading into #app) is covered by tests (tests/main.test.ts) and verified by running the test suite.
- No server-side code, CLI tool, or API endpoints found in the repository; the project is a static site (dependencies and files reflect this).
- E2E tooling (Playwright) and scripts are present (playwright config and e2e scripts), but full E2E tests were not executed here.
- Attempt to run npm run preview (start a local preview server) failed in this environment with spawnSync /bin/sh ETIMEDOUT — likely an environment/timeout issue rather than a build error.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the dev server locally (npm run dev) and manually verify the site in a browser (http://localhost:5173) to confirm runtime behavior in a browser environment.
- Run E2E Playwright tests (npm run e2e:ci or npx playwright test) in a CI or local environment that supports launching browsers to validate real browser behavior and catch regressions in animations/3D assets.
- If preview failures persist in automated environments, investigate the spawnSync timeout (increase timeout or use start_server wrapper) and ensure CI runners allow preview processes.
- Add or run accessibility and visual regression checks (axe, Playwright snapshots) if higher confidence in UX/visual correctness is required.
- If this project should expose an API or CLI, add explicit entry points and tests for those; otherwise document in README that this is a static site with no backend.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The project demonstrates high code quality for the application code: TypeScript is used with strict settings, ESLint/Stylelint/Prettier configs are present, type-checking and unit tests pass, and lint/test scripts are provided. The main outstanding issues are formatting/lint problems in the documentation (many markdownlint errors) and a few Prettier warnings for non-source files. Addressing docs formatting and running automatic fixes will bring this to near-production quality.
- Linting configuration present and structured: eslint.config.ts and a layered config in config/eslint (base, dx, performance). stylelint.config.ts and prettier.config.ts exist and are applied via package.json scripts.
- Package.json includes explicit scripts for lint, lint:fix, lint:check, lint:css, lint:md, format, format:check, type-check, test and verify (combined pipeline).
- TypeScript config: tsconfig.json extends a central base and compilerOptions include strict=true; running `tsc --noEmit` completed without errors.
- Unit tests (Vitest) exist for app initialization and utilities and all tests passed when run. Output: 4 test files, 14 tests, all passed.
- ESLint run produced no visible errors when executed (npm run lint / npm run lint:check returned without errors).
- Stylelint for CSS and the project's CSS file exist; running lint:css completed without reported errors for the source CSS.
- Prettier format check reported style issues for at least one non-source file (e2e-stability.json) — see `npm run format:check` output which warns about that file.
- Markdown linting (markdownlint-cli2 via `npm run lint:md`) produced many failures across docs (MD041, MD010 hard tabs, MD009 trailing spaces, MD012 multiple blank lines, MD033 inline HTML, etc.). This is a significant source of lint failures in the repository.
- Code organization is clean and minimal for the app: src contains app.ts and main.ts with clear separation of initialization logic (app.init extracted for testability). Naming is consistent and function-level error handling exists (app.init checks for missing #app and logs error).
- No obvious code duplication in the app-level code (small codebase).
- CI/automation: repository contains .github workflows and scripts, and a 'verify' script that chains linting, formatting checks, build and tests — good developer workflow integration.

**Next Steps:**
- Run Prettier across the repo (e.g. `npm run format`) and/or add/prefer Prettier configuration for JSON and other file types causing warnings (e.g. e2e-stability.json) so format:check passes.
- Fix the markdownlint issues reported by `npm run lint:md` (start by running `npm run lint:md` locally and apply fixes or `markdownlint-cli2 --fix` where possible). This is the largest outstanding lint noise and affects documentation quality.
- Run ESLint/Stylelint with autofix flags (`npm run lint:fix`, `npm run lint:css:fix`) and review any remaining warnings to enforce a zero-warnings policy in CI (lint:check already uses --max-warnings 0).
- Add Prettier/Markdownlint to pre-commit hooks (husky is present) so docs and generated files are formatted before commits.
- Consider adding a CI gating rule to fail the pipeline on markdownlint/Prettier issues (the verify script exists but ensure GitHub Actions actually runs that in PR checks).
- Expand tests/coverage if the project grows: add small integration/e2e checks for the site entry or add coverage thresholds to the CI test runs to prevent regressions.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Good unit testing setup: Vitest-based tests run successfully with full coverage for the exercised files. Playwright e2e tests and broader integration coverage exist but are not executed by the unit test run and require separate CI orchestration.
- Vitest is configured and used (package.json scripts: test, test:ci, test:coverage; vitest.config.ts present).
- Found 4 unit test files in tests/ (coverage-increase.test.ts, health-check-utils.test.ts, main.test.ts, prepare-libraries.test.ts) and a Playwright e2e test at tests/e2e/app.spec.ts.
- Running 'npm run test:ci' executed Vitest: 14 tests passed, 0 failed in the local run.
- V8 coverage reported in the run shows 100% statements/branches/functions/lines for app.ts and main.ts (coverage reporters configured: text, json, html).
- tests/setup.ts configures @testing-library/jest-dom and clears DOM between tests, demonstrating test hygiene.
- Playwright configuration and an 'e2e:ci' script exist, but e2e tests were not run as part of the Vitest suite (tests/e2e/** excluded in vitest config).
- DevDependencies include vitest, @playwright/test, testing-library packages, and coverage tooling (@vitest/coverage-v8).

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate Playwright e2e tests into CI (or document the separate e2e pipeline). Ensure CI starts a server (vite build/preview or dev server) before running e2e tests and captures Playwright reports.
- Increase unit/integration test coverage beyond app.ts/main.ts to cover more of the codebase (scripts/, other src modules) so coverage metrics reflect overall project quality.
- Add CI job badges (tests and coverage) to README to surface test status.
- Implement flaky-test mitigation for e2e (retries, stable timeouts, server readiness checks) and store Playwright artifacts in CI for debugging failures.
- Consider adding integration tests that exercise module interactions (not just DOM unit tests) and expand test matrix in CI if multi-environment compatibility is required.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The project executes correctly for the main developer workflows: the test suite (Vitest) passes and a production build (Vite) is produced. Runtime initialization code is defensive and tests exercise key behaviors. Minor execution issues were observed: the preview command timed out in this environment and the repository fails the health-check due to a Prettier formatting issue (non-blocking for build/test). Playwright e2e tests are configured but were not executed here.
- Unit/integration tests: npm run test (Vitest) completed successfully — 4 test files, 14 tests, all passed.
- Build: npm run build succeeded. Vite produced a dist/ with index.html and assets (built in ~222ms).
- Distribution artifacts: dist/index.html and assets exist and reference built JS/CSS bundles.
- Dev server: npm run dev was started in the background (process started). I could not fully verify service responsiveness from this environment (network/process checks were inconclusive).
- Preview: npm run preview failed in this environment with a spawn/timeout error (ETIMEDOUT) when attempting to run the preview command.
- Health-check: npm run health-check ran but failed the Prettier format check. The log shows a code style issue for e2e-stability.json (Prettier reported formatting issues).
- Runtime checks / error handling: src/app.ts checks for the #app element and logs an error + returns if missing (tests verify this behavior). health-check.js includes clear messages and good exit codes for failures.
- E2E configuration: Playwright is present and configured (playwright.config.ts), but no Playwright e2e tests were executed during this assessment.
- Node engine: package.json requires Node >=22.17.0 and the environment used Node v22.17.1 so engine checks pass here.
- Lockfile & deps: package-lock.json is present. Tests and build succeeded using the current installed node_modules.

**Next Steps:**
- Address Prettier formatting issues (e.g., run npm run format or fix e2e-stability.json) so the health-check script passes as part of verify/CI.
- From a local environment, re-run npm run preview (or increase the timeout) and verify the preview server responds (curl http://localhost:<preview-port>) and serves the built files.
- Run the Playwright e2e suite against a running preview to validate end-to-end runtime behavior (set PREVIEW_URL or run preview + playwright test).
- Add/confirm automated checks in CI to run build -> preview -> e2e (or use a headless server start + Playwright) so preview availability is validated in CI.
- Improve runtime observability if needed: ensure dev/preview server logs are captured during start/preview steps and surface any startup errors in CI logs.
- Optional: document exact Node/npm versions and any required environment variables for preview/e2e in README to reduce environment-specific timeouts.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (80% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is generally strong for developer onboarding and architectural rationale (good README, developer setup, ADRs and library notes, security/audit docs). Missing items and small gaps (no changelog/release notes, no API docs or formal public API reference, some empty placeholder docs and sparse inline code comments) prevent a higher score.
- README.md present and thorough: contains quick start, scripts, build/test/lint instructions and troubleshooting guidance. Matches package.json scripts and node engine requirement.
- Developer-focused docs exist: docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md provides step-by-step verification, reproduce instructions for audit tooling and CI recommendations.
- Architectural documentation: docs/decisions/ contains many accepted Markdown ADRs (0000..0024) documenting architectural decisions.
- Library / dependency guidance: docs/libraries/ contains many per-library markdown notes (e.g., vite.md, typescript.md, vitest.md), useful for maintainers.
- Security and audit docs: SECURITY.md, audit-summary.md and scripts are present and describe triage and CI scan artifacts.
- Repository-level scripts and docs tooling: package.json exposes docs-related scripts (docs:setup, docs:report) and a verify workflow; README references verification and CI-local commands.
- Source code inline documentation is minimal: src/main.ts and src/app.ts include only brief comments. There are no JSDoc-style docstrings describing public interfaces.
- No API reference found: no API.md, no generated API docs or formal public API documentation (repo appears to be a small static site, but an explicit note would help).
- No changelog or release notes discovered (no CHANGELOG.md or releases/ notes).
- Some docs are empty/placeholders: docs/E2E-REPRO.md and docs/CI-AUDIT.md are empty (no content), indicating unfinished documentation in places.
- Tests and developer docs are consistent: tests exist and README/docs instructions align with package.json scripts (evidence of upkeep).

**Next Steps:**
- Add a changelog or release notes (CHANGELOG.md) and document release/versioning process (how releases are recorded and where to find them).
- Either populate or remove empty placeholder docs (e.g., docs/E2E-REPRO.md, docs/CI-AUDIT.md) and ensure each docs/ file has a purpose and content.
- Add a brief API/reference document (API.md) or a short section in README explaining there is no public API if appropriate. If there are public modules, add JSDoc or generated API docs.
- Improve inline code documentation: add JSDoc comments for exported functions and module-level descriptions to help maintainers and enable automatic doc generation.
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md and a short release / changelog maintenance guideline so contributors know how to update docs and record changes.
- Consider a documentation index or docs/README that maps the available documents (developer setup, ADRs, libraries, security) to make discovery easier.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (75% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are declared and installed; an automated audit (audit.json / npm audit) reports zero vulnerabilities and npm ls shows top-level packages installed. However the repository is missing a lockfile (package-lock.json), which undermines reproducible installs and some repository scripts/CI expectations. I could not produce an automated outdated report in this environment, so the exact freshness of packages is unknown.
- package.json present and lists 3 production dependencies (@microsoft/clarity, gsap, three) and many devDependencies (eslint, vitest, playwright, typescript, vite, etc.). (file: package.json)
- npm audit returned a report with zero vulnerabilities (audit.json and audit-summary.md exist and match). Command run: `npm audit --json` returned no vulnerabilities. (files: audit.json, audit-summary.md, ci-audit.json, ci-audit-summary.md)
- Installed modules are present in node_modules and top-level installed package versions are visible via `npm ls --depth=0 --json` (output shows the packages listed in package.json are installed). (command: npm ls --depth=0 --json)
- No lockfile in repository root: package-lock.json / yarn.lock / pnpm-lock.yaml are missing. The health-check script explicitly checks for package-lock.json and will fail when it is absent. (file: scripts/health-check.js — checkLockfileAndNodeModules; missing package-lock.json observed)
- CI workflows and some scripts expect or reference a lockfile (e.g. .github/workflows/ci.yml uses package-lock.json in cache keys and runs `npm ci`). Without a committed lockfile CI reproducibility is reduced. (file: .github/workflows/ci.yml)
- Many dependency versions in package.json use caret ranges (^) which is fine when a lockfile is used, but without a lockfile the installed versions can vary over time. (file: package.json)
- I attempted to run `npm outdated --json` but the command failed in this environment, so I could not determine which dependencies are out-of-date here. Recommend running `npm outdated` in a networked environment or CI. (command: npm outdated failed)
- Repository contains automation and artifacts for dependency/security scanning (SECURITY.md, audit artifacts, CI audit artifacts), indicating an existing maintenance process but relying on ephemeral local or CI-generated lockfiles rather than a committed lockfile.

**Next Steps:**
- Generate and commit a lockfile: run `npm ci` (or `npm install`) locally to create package-lock.json, verify install, then commit package-lock.json to the repository. This ensures reproducible installs and aligns with CI which runs `npm ci`.
- Re-run vulnerability and freshness checks after the lockfile is present: `npm audit --json > audit.json` and `npm outdated --json` and review results. If `npm audit` reports issues run `npm audit fix` (or open PRs to update/replace vulnerable packages).
- Add automated dependency freshness checks to CI (e.g., run `npm outdated` or use tooling like Renovate/Dependabot) and fail the release pipeline on known-critical advisories.
- If you want strict pinned versions, consider using exact versions in package.json or rely on the lockfile for reproducible builds; avoid relying solely on caret ranges without committing the lockfile.
- Update scripts/documentation to make the lockfile requirement explicit (README and health-check already hint at this) and ensure CI caching keys/reference the committed lockfile (e.g., hashFiles('package-lock.json')).
- Periodically run `npm audit` and schedule regular dependency updates in a maintenance cadence; consider enabling automated PRs from Renovate/Dependabot and a small maintenance window to test dependency updates.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Strong security automation and good hygiene for a static site: daily npm-audit, secret scanning (gitleaks), CodeQL, SBOM generation, Dependabot and pre-commit checks are present and configured. Local/CI npm audit shows zero vulnerabilities and repository secret scan artifacts are empty. Remaining gaps are around runtime hardening (CSP/security headers, HTTPS enforcement in hosting config), explicit SRI/CSP for external resources, and no server-side auth/validation (the project is a static pre-launch site so runtime surface is small).
- GitHub Actions security workflows present: .github/workflows/security-audit.yml (daily npm audit + SBOM), .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml (gitleaks), .github/workflows/code-scanning.yml (CodeQL).
- Audit artifacts exist and show no current vulnerabilities: audit.json and audit-summary.md contain zero critical/high/moderate/low findings.
- Local execution of `npm audit --json` returned an empty vulnerabilities set (auditReportVersion 2, all counts 0) confirming the packaged lockfile currently has no known npm advisories.
- .github/scripts/parse-audit.js exists and enforces failing the workflow if high/critical advisories are detected (exits non-zero on high/critical).
- Secret scanning configured to redact results and fail the job if secrets are detected; repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt and repo-secrets-scan.txt are present but empty (no plaintext secrets found in these artifacts).
- Pre-commit hooks (.husky/pre-commit) enforce non-mutating checks (format:check, lint:check, type-check) to keep code quality and reduce risk from accidental commits.
- Dependabot is configured (.github/dependabot.yml) for weekly npm dependency update PRs, supporting timely dependency maintenance.
- package.json includes security-related scripts (audit:fix, security:local) and a verify script used by CI to run audits/lints/build/tests.
- Greps across the repository for common secret patterns (password, token, AKIA, PRIVATE_KEY, etc.) returned no matches, providing additional evidence of no obvious hardcoded secrets.
- Project is a static site (no server-side code in repository). That reduces runtime attack surface but also means there is no server-level configuration for security headers, HTTPS enforcement, or server-side input validation/authentication in this repo.
- No explicit Content Security Policy (CSP) meta tag, security headers configuration, or Subresource Integrity (SRI) usage was found in the repository files inspected (index.html has no CSP meta tag and no SRI attributes).

**Next Steps:**
- Add host-level/runtime security hardening guidance to the repo (in docs/ or SECURITY.md): recommend CSP headers/meta, HSTS/HTTPS enforcement, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and Referrer-Policy for the chosen hosting environment.
- Add Subresource Integrity (SRI) or pin external resources where applicable and document any required external scripts; include checks in CI for SRI where external scripts are used.
- Ensure SBOM (sbom.json) is produced and archived from the security-audit workflow and add a periodic review step for SBOM diffs to detect unexpected transitive dependencies.
- Continue to monitor and triage any future npm audit/CodeQL/gitleaks artifacts; create an issue/PR workflow to prioritize remediation for any future high/critical findings (parse-audit.js already fails on high/critical—ensure triage process is documented).
- Consider adding a lightweight local secret-scan pre-commit hook (e.g., a pre-commit task that runs a fast secrets scanner) to catch secrets before they reach CI, complementing gitleaks in CI.
- Document hosting-specific security settings in README or deploy docs (how to enable HTTPS/HSTS and set CSP headers on your host like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or S3/CloudFront).
- If the project will later include server-side components or user input, add explicit input validation, authentication/authorization flows, and tests covering security-sensitive functionality; extend CodeQL rules/config if needed.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (82% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Version control is well-established with a long history, clear conventional commit messages, CI workflows, pre-commit hooks and tags. Minor issues remain: a non-clean working tree with tracked transient .voder artifacts, no lockfile (npm/yarn/pnpm) present in the repository, and a few repository housekeeping items (no .gitattributes, tracked transient files) that should be addressed.
- Git repository is present and healthy: 293 commits (git rev-list --count HEAD = 293).
- Current branch: fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage (git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD).
- Recent commits show consistent conventional-style messages (e.g. ci(...):, chore(...):, test(...):) and are authored by 'voder-bot' and 'Tom Howard' (git log / git shortlog).
- Working directory is not clean: git status shows modified tracked files: .voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md (and .voder/.processes.json per `git status --ignored`).
- .voder/ files appear to be tracked (they are modified and show as 'M'), and .voder is not listed in .gitignore (contents of .gitignore do not include .voder).
- .gitignore exists and includes sensible patterns (node_modules, dist, coverage, logs, env files, etc.).
- .husky pre-commit hook is configured to run format:check, lint:check and type-check (pre-commit at .husky/pre-commit) and a helper skip-pre-commit.sh exists.
- Remote origin configured: https://github.com/mountain-pass/voder.ai-website.git (git config). Branches show both local and remote tracking for the active feature branch and main.
- CI and security workflows present (.github/workflows contains ci.yml, e2e-stability.yml, code-scanning.yml, secret-scan.yml, security-audit.yml).
- Tags exist: v1.0.0-complete and v1.0.1 (git tag -l).
- No lockfile was found in the repository (no package-lock.json, yarn.lock or pnpm-lock.yaml discovered), reducing install reproducibility.
- No .gitattributes file detected (no explicit attributes for e.g. LF normalization or Git LFS configuration in repo).
- Some hook files under .husky/_ are filtered by ignore settings but hookspath is set to .husky/_ (git config), and a skip helper exists for constrained environments.
- Repository-level git config shows repo user.name/email set to voder-bot@example.com (file:.git/config), which explains many bot commits; human commits exist but many automated commits are present.

**Next Steps:**
- Decide how to handle the .voder directory: if it contains transient or local-only state, add .voder/ to .gitignore and remove tracked .voder files (git rm --cached .voder/* and commit). If some files must remain tracked, move transient files out of the tracked tree.
- Add and commit a lockfile for reproducible installs (run npm ci / npm install to generate package-lock.json, or choose yarn/pnpm and commit the corresponding lockfile).
- Consider adding a .gitattributes file to lock EOL normalization and register any large-file handling (Git LFS) if needed.
- Clean the working directory before release or CI-critical operations: commit or stash local changes, then ensure CI runs from a clean state.
- If desired, make author identity explicit for human commits (ensure commit authorship and bot commits are clearly attributable) and document commit/PR workflows in CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Optionally: enforce branch protection rules and signing policies on the remote (GitHub) to improve release/merge hygiene; consider ensuring lockfile/CI check for clean working tree in PR verification.
