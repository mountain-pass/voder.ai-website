  - ‚úÖ Step-by-step process visualization (Source Prompts ‚Üí Voder ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Product) with correct text content
  - ‚úÖ Proper semantic markup and accessibility structure with screen reader alternatives
  - ‚úÖ Responsive layout with clean presentation
  - ‚úÖ Correct content: "Intent lives in markdown prompts", "Voder interprets and compiles", etc.

  - ‚úÖ Correct headline: "Change the prompt. Not the team."
  - ‚úÖ Basic UI mockup showing before/after states
  - ‚úÖ Functional scroll-triggered content update
- **Missing Critical Elements (90% of specified functionality):**
  - ‚ùå **5-second transition from Vision Flow** (diagram zoom out, background darkening, prompt panel fade-in)

- **Implementation Completeness:** **~10% of specified interactive sophistication**
- **Gap Analysis:** The specification calls for a **fully functional demo of the Voder product** - essentially a working editor with real-time UI transformation. Current implementation is a minimal content swap that doesn't demonstrate the core value proposition. Missing the critical transition from Vision Flow and sophisticated interactive capabilities.

#### 7. Outcome Focus Section

## ‚ö° DISABLED FEATURES (For Stability)

### 3D Graphics Systems

- **Brand Entry:** Three.js 3D objects now ACTIVE with basic wireframe animation
- **Problem Space:** Particle chaos system (`VisualChaos.ts`) - Code exists but intentionally disabled
- **Reason:** VisualChaos disabled in ProblemSection.ts (line 3 commented out import)

### GSAP Target Warnings

Console warnings about missing GSAP targets indicate disabled visual systems:

- `.visual-chaos` - Intentionally disabled 3D chaos effects for Problem Space
- `.journey-diagram` - Replaced by GPS metaphor visualization  
- `.flow-diagram svg line,.flow-diagram svg circle` - Missing animated flow elements
- Various section elements - Due to unimplemented cinematic features

These warnings do not affect functionality and tests pass completely, but indicate substantial missing visual complexity.
