# Implementation Progress Assessment

**Assessment Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Assessment Status**: BLOCKED BY DEPENDENCIES  
**Assessment Phase**: Phase 1 - Dependencies Validation

## Assessment Summary

**CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUE**: Outdated dependencies found that prevent proceeding with new story development.

## Phase 1: Dependencies Validation - FAILED

### Dependency Currency Issues Found

The following dependencies are outdated and require updating:

1. **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Current 6.8.0 → Latest 6.9.0 (patch update)
2. **@types/node**: Current 24.6.0 → Latest 24.6.1 (patch update) 
3. **jiti**: Current 2.6.0 → Latest 2.6.1 (patch update)
4. **typescript**: Current 5.9.2 → Latest 5.9.3 (patch update)

### Assessment Termination Reason

Per assessment criteria: "ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS - NEVER CONCLUDE 'READY FOR NEXT STORY' WITH: ANY old dependencies (major, minor, or patch)". 

Since outdated dependencies were found in Phase 1, the assessment was terminated early using the fail-fast approach as instructed.

## Next Required Actions (Priority Order)

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Update all outdated dependencies to latest versions
2. **VERIFY**: Run `npm install` to install updated dependencies
3. **VALIDATE**: Ensure all dependencies install correctly without conflicts
4. **TEST**: Run full test suite to verify compatibility
5. **RE-ASSESS**: Re-run assessment starting from Phase 1 after dependency updates

## Resolution Required Before New Story Development

All dependencies must be updated to their latest versions before any new story development can proceed. This is a zero-tolerance requirement per the assessment criteria.

## Assessment Evidence

- **Command Run**: `npm outdated`
- **Exit Code**: 1 (indicating outdated packages found)
- **Dependencies Analyzed**: Production and development dependencies in package.json
- **Package Manager**: npm (detected from package.json configuration)
