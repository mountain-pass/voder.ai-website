Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 59.7

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (76.63% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
Overall the project is in a strong state: the site builds, unit tests pass, and quality tooling is well-integrated. However several gating areas fall below required thresholds (notably TESTING, EXECUTION, and DEPENDENCIES). CI Playwright E2E reliability and preview readiness need immediate attention, plus a reproducible lockfile and clearer reproduction docs. Addressing these will raise the overall readiness into the required bands.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Stabilize CI E2E runs by fixing preview readiness (run-e2e.sh), ensure Playwright artifacts are captured, and address the missing lockfile to guarantee reproducible installs.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (90% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- The repository implements a working static pre-launch website with a clear main entry, build pipeline, and passing test suite. Build and test commands run successfully. It is functionally complete for a small static site but limited in scope (no API/CLI) and would benefit from additional end-to-end tests and runtime verification in a browser/CI.
- Main entry point exists: src/main.ts which imports ./app.js and initializes the app on DOMContentLoaded.
- App implementation present and testable: src/app.ts exports init() which populates the #app element with content.
- index.html references the module entry: <script type="module" src="/src/main.ts"></script> (so dev/preview via Vite will load the app).
- Build works: npm run build completed successfully with vite producing dist/index.html and assets (build output shown).
- Tests pass: npm run test ran Vitest; result: 4 test files, 14 tests passed (no failures).
- Developer scripts present: dev, build, preview, type-check, test, lint, format, verify, prepare, health-check, etc. (package.json contains full scripts list).
- prepare-libraries.js runs and linked README files from node_modules into docs/libraries (script executed without error).
- Project is a static website — no API endpoints, server code, or CLI entrypoints were found (functionality limited to client-side static content).
- E2E tooling exists (Playwright config and scripts) but full E2E tests were not executed as part of this assessment.
- No runtime errors were observed during build/test/prepare steps executed here.

**Next Steps:**
- Run npm run dev and manually verify the app in a browser (http://localhost:5173) to validate runtime behavior and visual layout.
- Execute end-to-end tests with Playwright (npm run e2e:ci or npx playwright test) and add/expand E2E tests to cover critical user flows.
- Add automated CI (or verify CI config) to run the verify pipeline (lint, build, tests, e2e) on pushes/PRs to ensure regressions are caught early.
- Increase functional test coverage by adding tests for edge cases and any interactive/animated components (if added later).
- If the project intends to expose APIs or CLIs in the future, add integration tests and documented entry points for those features.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Code quality is strong: the project has a complete lint/format/test/type-check toolchain, well-structured configs (ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint, Vitest), and all tests and TypeScript checks pass. Only minor, auto-fixable issues were found (a few ESLint warnings and a Prettier style warning in a GitHub script).
- Tooling coverage: package.json includes scripts for lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, test, type-check and a verify pipeline.
- ESLint is configured with a layered flat config under config/eslint and exported via eslint.config.ts.
- Running `npm run lint` initially reported 5 ESLint warnings in .github/scripts/generate-e2e-stability-summary.js (padding-line-between-statements). These are fixable with `--fix` and `npm run lint:fix` was executed successfully.
- Prettier configuration present (prettier.config.ts). `npm run format:check` reported formatting issues for .github/scripts/generate-e2e-stability-summary.js; running `npm run format` auto-formatted files.
- TypeScript type-check passed with `npm run type-check` (tsc --noEmit) with no errors.
- Tests pass: `npm test` ran Vitest; 4 test files ran and all tests passed (14 tests total).
- Stylelint config exists (stylelint.config.ts) and scripts are provided to lint/fix CSS files.
- Project layout is clean and organized: src/ contains minimal runtime code (app.ts, main.ts, style.css), tests/ contains unit tests, and config/ centralizes tooling configs.
- Naming and patterns are consistent and idiomatic for a TypeScript/Vite web project; no obvious duplication in the small codebase.
- Error handling in runtime code is present and appropriate for the context (app.ts checks for missing #app and logs an error).
- CI-related workflows and health-check scripts are present (.github/workflows and scripts/health-check.js), indicating attention to automation and quality gates.

**Next Steps:**
- Ensure Prettier and ESLint checks are enforced in CI by running `npm run verify` (or the equivalent verify flow) to prevent regressions.
- Add or enable pre-commit hooks (husky exists in repo) to run `npm run format` and `npm run lint:fix` before commits so style issues do not reach CI.
- Address the remaining lint/format findings in any other auxiliary scripts and confirm `npm run format:check` and `npm run lint:check` both pass with zero warnings locally and in CI.
- Consider progressively tightening lint rules (promote select 'warn' rules to 'error') to improve consistency across contributors.
- If desired, add a minimum coverage threshold in CI to preserve test coverage as the codebase grows and ensure tests cover new runtime logic.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (50% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- Unit tests (Vitest/jsdom) are present, well-configured and pass locally with 100% coverage for application files. Playwright E2E tests and CI workflows exist, but recent CI runs show repeated E2E failures. Because tests are failing in CI, the testing score is capped at 50%.
- Test framework and scripts: package.json defines test scripts using Vitest (test, test:coverage, test:ci) and E2E via Playwright (e2e:ci). devDependencies include vitest and @playwright/test.
- Unit tests present: tests/*.test.ts (coverage-increase.test.ts, health-check-utils.test.ts, main.test.ts, prepare-libraries.test.ts) and tests/setup.ts are included and use Vitest with jsdom.
- Local test run: I executed `npm test` (vitest) — result: 4 test files, 14 tests passed (14).
- Coverage: I executed `npm run test:coverage` — v8 coverage reported 100% statements/branches/functions/lines for app.ts and main.ts.
- Vitest config: vitest.config.ts and config/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts configure jsdom environment, setupFiles, and coverage provider/thresholds.
- E2E tests: tests/e2e/app.spec.ts and playwright.config.ts exist; Playwright is configured to run against a preview server at http://127.0.0.1:5173.
- Run-e2e script: scripts/run-e2e.sh manages starting preview, installing Playwright browsers, running tests and writing e2e-stability artifacts; it writes preview logs and supports graceful reuse of existing preview processes.
- CI evidence: .github/workflows/ci.yml runs type-check, lint, build and test:ci, then runs run-e2e.sh. The repository's workflow history shows repeated failures in the e2e-stability workflow (multiple recent failures), indicating failing E2E in CI.

**Next Steps:**
- Download and inspect failing CI artifacts (preview.out, test-results, playwright-results.json, test-ci.log) from the last failing runs to identify root cause (preview server not starting, port/address mismatch, Playwright browser install issues, test timeouts, etc.).
- Reproduce E2E locally using the project's script: run `npx playwright install --with-deps`, `npm run preview` (or `./scripts/run-e2e.sh`) and then `npx playwright test` to capture preview logs and Playwright output; iterate until the failure is reproducible and diagnosable.
- If failures are due to server startup timing, increase timeouts or improve health checks in scripts/run-e2e.sh and/or Playwright config; ensure CI installs Playwright browsers before running tests.
- Make E2E tests more robust: wait for specific selectors or application-ready signals instead of relying on brittle title checks, add retries for flaky checks, and ensure tests clean up side effects.
- Temporarily separate or gate heavy/flaky E2E from fast unit tests in CI (e.g., run unit tests on PRs and E2E on nightly or dedicated job) until stability is achieved to avoid blocking core development workflows.
- Add better CI diagnostics: ensure playwright JSON results, screenshots, traces and server logs are uploaded for every run to speed debugging of intermittent failures; add alerting for repeated failures.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (72% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- The project builds and tests successfully (good execution fundamentals). The production build completes and Vitest tests all pass. However there are execution-related issues: lint/format checks fail (warnings), preview/dev server startup was unreliable in this environment, and the repository declares a Node engine (>=22.17.0) that does not match the Node runtime observed here. These issues prevent a fully smooth developer/CI verification flow.
- Build: `npm run build` completed successfully (vite built assets; output showed dist assets and JS/CSS files).
- Tests: `npm run test` (Vitest) passed entirely: 4 test files, 14 tests, all passed.
- Type-check: `npm run type-check` (tsc --noEmit) ran without errors.
- Lint: `npm run lint` reported 5 warnings (0 errors). `npm run lint:check` failed because it enforces zero warnings (ESLint found too many warnings).
- Format: `npm run format:check` reported Prettier warnings (file .github/scripts/generate-e2e-stability-summary.js).
- Preview/dev server: attempts to run `npm run preview` timed out (spawnSync ETIMEDOUT). Starting the dev server produced background vite processes but curl to expected ports returned no content in this environment; multiple lingering vite/preview processes were observed during exploration.
- Node engine mismatch: package.json declares "engines.node": ">=22.17.0", but `node -v` returned v10.9.2 in the environment used for inspection (this will cause the project's health checks to flag an error).
- Runtime dependencies and lockfile: package-lock.json and node_modules/ are present; runtime deps (e.g., three, gsap) are declared. Build and tests succeeded using installed dependencies.
- Runtime error handling: app init function checks for #app and logs an error if missing (basic runtime guard present).
- Health-check script present: scripts/health-check.js implements environment checks (node engine, lockfile, node_modules) and runs type-check/lint/format steps; some of these steps fail locally due to warnings and node mismatch.

**Next Steps:**
- Fix lint and Prettier issues (run `npm run lint:fix` and `npm run format -- --write` or manually address the reported files) so `lint:check` and `format:check` pass in CI.
- Ensure the runtime Node version used in CI and local development matches package.json engines (install Node >=22.17.0 via nvm/fnm/Volta) — this will make health-check deterministic.
- Investigate and stabilize preview/dev server startup behavior: reproduce `npm run preview` and `npm run dev` locally after fixing Node version, confirm ports configured in vite.config.ts are free, and ensure the server serves dist/index.html (smoke-test with curl).
- Consolidate any lingering vite processes in developer machines or CI by ensuring servers are cleanly shut down after use; consider adding explicit timeouts or port checks in dev scripts.
- Add or update CI steps to run the repository's `verify` or `health-check` script to catch engine/lint/format regressions early.
- Document exact Node/npm versions and the recommended install steps in README (or provide an .nvmrc / .node-version) to avoid engine mismatch.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (78% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Overall the repository has solid developer-facing documentation (README with quick start, a detailed DEVELOPER-SETUP guide, architectural decision records, library notes, security/audit docs and CI workflows). It is missing API documentation, a changelog/release notes, and some docs files are empty. Inline code comments/docstrings are minimal. Documentation is good for contributors and maintainers but lacks a few important artifacts for users and release traceability.
- README.md exists and provides clear quick-start, build/test/lint commands and troubleshooting guidance (file: README.md).
- Developer setup instructions are provided in docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md with step-by-step verification and CI recommendations (file: docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md).
- Architectural documentation is present as Markdown ADRs in docs/decisions/ (multiple accepted ADR files like 0000-0024).
- Library notes are present under docs/libraries/ for many third-party dependencies (files such as docs/libraries/vite.md, typescript.md, etc.).
- Security and audit artifacts and guidance are present: SECURITY.md, audit-summary.md, ci-audit-summary.md and a security GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/security-audit.yml).
- package.json contains helpful scripts for docs operations (docs:setup, docs:report), verification (verify), health-check, and security helpers, aligning with README and docs guidance.
- Some docs files are empty or incomplete: docs/E2E-REPRO.md appears empty and docs/CI-AUDIT.md is empty (files: docs/E2E-REPRO.md, docs/CI-AUDIT.md).
- No CHANGELOG or release notes were found anywhere in the repo (search for CHANGELOG* returned no matches).
- No API reference or OpenAPI-style documentation located; there is no API.md or similar for any public API surface.
- Source code contains minimal inline comments (e.g., src/app.ts has a single comment) but lacks detailed docstrings or exported API docs for the small public surface (files: src/app.ts, src/main.ts).
- Markdown linting and formatting configuration is present (.markdownlint.json, prettier.config.ts) and there are scripts for linting/formatting docs (package.json scripts: lint:md, lint:md:fix).
- Audit summary files (audit-summary.md, ci-audit-summary.md) exist and show the repository is being audited and results tracked.
- Docs appear largely up-to-date with code where explicitly referenced: README references Node engine and package.json contains the same node engine constraint (engines.node >=22.17.0).

**Next Steps:**
- Add a CHANGELOG.md or release notes file (or adopt Keep a Changelog) and start recording releases and notable changes to improve traceability.
- Add API documentation or an API.md (or OpenAPI/Swagger) documenting any public interfaces, endpoints or scripts that consumers might use.
- Populate or remove empty docs files (docs/E2E-REPRO.md, docs/CI-AUDIT.md) to avoid confusion — if content is intentionally omitted, add a short note explaining the omission.
- Improve inline documentation in source (add docstrings/comments for exported functions/modules) so library consumers and maintainers can understand code intent without reading implementation.
- Consider adding a short CONTRIBUTING.md with contributor flow, PR expectations, and documentation guidelines (how to update ADRs, add library docs, and update changelog).
- If release automation exists, document the release process in docs (how to cut releases, update version, publish artifacts) and link it from README or DEVELOPER-SETUP.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (75% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are declared and installed and automated audits report no known vulnerabilities. However the repository lacks a committed lockfile (package-lock.json / yarn.lock / pnpm-lock.yaml), which undermines reproducible installs and is flagged by the project's health-check script.
- package.json exists and lists runtime dependencies: @microsoft/clarity (^1.0.0), gsap (^3.13.0), three (^0.180.0) and a comprehensive devDependencies section (vite, typescript, vitest, eslint, etc.).
- node_modules/ is present and npm ls --depth=0 confirmed top-level packages are installed.
- No lockfile found in the repository: package-lock.json, yarn.lock and pnpm-lock.yaml are all absent. scripts/health-check.js explicitly errors when package-lock.json is missing.
- npm audit (run locally) and included audit.json/ci-audit.json report zero vulnerabilities (0 critical/high/moderate/low).
- Audit metadata shows a substantial dependency graph (total dependencies ~765–769), so transitive dependencies exist even if direct runtime deps are small.
- package.json uses caret (^) ranges for versions; without a lockfile this allows dependency resolution to change over time (version drift risk).
- Repository contains scripts and CI-oriented tooling for audits (audit:fix, security:local), indicating security checks are integrated into maintenance workflows.
- Attempt to run `npm outdated` in this environment failed, so an up-to-date/outdated snapshot of direct dependencies could not be produced from the repo alone.

**Next Steps:**
- Generate and commit a lockfile (package-lock.json, or yarn.lock/pnpm-lock.yaml) by running `npm install` or `npm ci` locally and committing the resulting lockfile to ensure reproducible installs.
- Ensure CI installs using the lockfile (use `npm ci` in CI) and add a CI check that fails if the lockfile is missing or out-of-sync.
- Add automated dependency update tooling (Dependabot, Renovate) or schedule periodic `npm outdated` checks and validate upgrades via CI and tests.
- Continue running `npm audit` in CI and configure alerts or failing CI on new high/critical vulnerabilities; address any findings promptly.
- Document the dependency installation workflow and Node engine requirement in README/CONTRIBUTING (explicitly recommend `npm ci` and the Node version) to help contributors produce consistent environments.
- Consider pinning critical runtime dependencies (or using lockfile-only policy) if strict reproducibility is required for production builds.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (75% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository demonstrates a solid security automation baseline (scheduled npm audit, secret scan, and CodeQL) and current audit artifacts show no npm vulnerabilities. However, there are operational gaps that reduce overall security posture: no lockfile in the repo, a bug in the secret-scan workflow that may prevent failing on detected secrets, and missing basic web hardening (CSP/SRI).
- Automated security workflows present: .github/workflows/security-audit.yml (npm audit + SBOM), .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml (gitleaks), and .github/workflows/code-scanning.yml (CodeQL).
- Audit artifacts included: audit.json and audit-summary.md report 0 vulnerabilities (critical/high/moderate/low/info all 0).
- parse-audit.js exists and correctly fails on high/critical advisories; package.json exposes security:local and audit:fix scripts.
- repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt and repo-secrets-scan.txt are present but empty in the repository; SECURITY.md documents the secret-scan artifacts and rotation guidance.
- No obvious plaintext secrets were found when searching for common secret keywords in tracked files.
- No package-lock.json (or alternative lockfile) found; scripts/health-check.js flags a missing package-lock.json as a health issue—this weakens supply-chain reproducibility and audit consistency.
- The secret-scan workflow has a logic issue: the gitleaks step has no step id but a later step references steps.gitleaks-scan.outputs.exit-code. Without a step id the conditional will not behave as intended and may not fail the job on detected secrets.
- SBOM generation is attempted in the security-audit workflow via npx @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-bom but the workflow tolerates failure (|| true), so SBOM may not always be produced; consider making SBOM generation explicit if required.
- CI uses GitHub secrets (e.g., VITE_SENTRY_DSN) rather than hardcoding credentials; this is good practice.
- Index.html has no Content-Security-Policy meta/header and no Subresource Integrity attributes for external resources. While this is a static site, these hardening measures should be considered for production hosting.
- Minor CI inconsistency: CI workflow sets up pnpm but installs dependencies with npm ci. Not directly a security flaw but can cause environment differences that impact reproducibility.

**Next Steps:**
- Add and commit a lockfile (package-lock.json or chosen lockfile) to the repository and ensure CI/automation use it (improves supply-chain security and consistent audit results).
- Fix the secret-scan workflow: assign an id to the gitleaks step (for example id: gitleaks) and reference steps.gitleaks.outputs.exit-code (or use the action's documented outputs). Validate the workflow in a test run to ensure it fails when secrets are detected.
- Decide whether SBOM generation is required and, if so, make SBOM generation deterministic in CI (install or pin the CycloneDX tool) and fail the job on SBOM generation failure if needed for compliance.
- Ensure parse-audit.js and the security-audit workflow cause CI failures on high/critical advisories and surface artifacts (audit.json, audit-summary.md, sbom.json) for triage.
- Harden the static site: add a Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header or meta tag and apply Subresource Integrity (SRI) for any externally-supplied assets. If hosted, enforce HTTPS and HSTS at the CDN/load-balancer level.
- Enable Dependabot (or similar) and configure automatic security updates and PRs; ensure dependency update PRs trigger the security workflows and tests.
- Add branch protection rules or required checks so security workflows (secret-scan, audit, CodeQL) must pass or be explicitly reviewed before merging.
- Periodically review and rotate any secrets found historically; maintain and exercise the redaction and rotation guidance in SECURITY.md.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (85% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- Version control is well-established: a long, descriptive commit history with conventional prefixes, multiple branches and tags, a proper .gitignore, remotes and hooks configured. The working tree is not clean (a few modified files) and there are a few minor omissions (no .gitattributes, repository metadata like LICENSE/CONTRIBUTING). Overall quality is high with a few actionable fixes.
- Current branch: fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage (HEAD).
- Working directory is not clean: git status shows modified files (.github/scripts/generate-e2e-stability-summary.js, .voder/.processes.json, .voder/history.md, .voder/last-action.md).
- Commit history is substantial (279 commits) and recent commits use clear, conventional message prefixes (e.g., docs:, ci(e2e):, test(e2e):, chore:).
- git log output shows recent, focused commits related to CI, tests and docs — active recent activity on topic branches.
- Remote configured: origin -> https://github.com/mountain-pass/voder.ai-website.git; branches track origin/main and origin/fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage.
- Tags present: v1.0.0-complete and v1.0.1.
- git config contains user.name/user.email and sensible defaults; hooks configured via .husky (core.hookspath=.husky/_).
- .gitignore exists and contains appropriate entries for node_modules, build outputs (dist/), env files, logs, coverage, temp files, and other common ignores.
- No .gitattributes file detected in repository.
- Some repository metadata files commonly expected (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING) were not found.
- There are multiple long-lived branches and cleanup branches (main, cleanup/*, feature/fix branches) visible via git branch -a.
- Some local modifications are in files under .voder — these look like local/ephemeral state files and are currently tracked/modified in the repo.

**Next Steps:**
- Make the working directory clean: commit intended changes or stash/discard ephemeral local changes. Review why .voder/* files are tracked — if they are local-only state, add them to .gitignore and remove from the repo (git rm --cached) or otherwise avoid committing them.
- Add a .gitattributes file to lock down line endings and language detection (e.g., set text, eol, linguist-vendored if needed).
- Add repository metadata: include a LICENSE file (choose appropriate license) and a CONTRIBUTING.md (or document contribution guidelines) to improve repo completeness.
- Consider auditing tracked files to ensure no ephemeral or sensitive files are committed; if there are intentionally ignored files that are still tracked, remove them from the index and add to .gitignore.
- If desired for higher security/compliance, enable commit signing and/or require signed commits in CI/protected branches; ensure branch protection rules on the remote (main) are configured.
- Document branch naming and commit message conventions in CONTRIBUTING.md or README to maintain the current good commit message quality.
