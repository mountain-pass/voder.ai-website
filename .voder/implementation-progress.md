![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (72.75% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The repository is largely well-structured with strong dependency and CI/security practices and a working static site. However the test orchestration is broken (Vitest/Playwright conflict) and overall unit/coverage targets are unmet. Per the project ADRs and prompt files, documented choices (tooling, ADRs, workflows) are respected and not penalized; the remaining gaps are configuration and targeted test additions to reach required thresholds.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Resolve the Vitest vs Playwright test-runner conflict and add focused Vitest unit tests to raise global coverage to >=90% (short-term: adjust test globs, mock Playwright files for Vitest, add coverage-focused tests).



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (72% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- The project contains a small, working static site with clear entry points (index.html, src/main.ts, src/app.ts). Unit tests for the app run and pass in isolation. However, the overall test/run workflow is broken: running the repository's top-level test script (npm test -> vitest) fails due to an e2e Playwright test that conflicts with Vitest. E2E tests are present but were not runnable in this environment. The core site features are implemented, but test configuration and e2e execution problems reduce the functionality score.
- Main entry points exist: index.html loads /src/main.ts, and src/main.ts imports and initializes src/app.ts.
- src/app.ts implements init() which finds #app and injects HTML (h1 'Voder', subtitle 'Coming soon...'), demonstrating the core runtime behavior.
- Unit test for the app (tests/main.test.ts and tests/coverage-increase.test.ts) exercise init() and pass when run directly with vitest for that file: running `npx vitest run tests/main.test.ts` returned 1 passed.
- Running the repository-level test script (`npm test`, which runs `vitest run`) failed: Vitest attempted to load tests/e2e/app.spec.ts which imports @playwright/test and caused Playwright to throw: 'Playwright Test did not expect test() to be called here.' This indicates a test-runner collision or misconfiguration.
- The error output from `npm test` shows the Playwright-related failure originating from tests/e2e/app.spec.ts (import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test').
- An attempt to run Playwright directly (`npx playwright test tests/e2e/app.spec.ts`) failed in this environment (no useful stderr captured). Browsers and Playwright config may not be installed/configured here.
- Git status is clean for project code (no unstaged changes affecting source files discovered here).

**Next Steps:**
- Fix test runner configuration: exclude Playwright e2e tests from Vitest's test discovery (move e2e tests to a directory Vitest ignores, or update vitest config globs).
- Update package.json scripts: keep `test` for unit tests (vitest) and add a separate `test:e2e` script that runs Playwright (e.g., `playwright test`). Example: "test": "vitest run --run", "test:e2e": "playwright test".
- If CI should run both, create a composite `verify` or `ci:test` script that runs vitest then playwright sequentially, and ensure Playwright browsers are installed in CI (`npx playwright install --with-deps` when needed).
- Run a local dev server (npm run dev) and smoke test the site in a browser to confirm the runtime behavior and ensure assets load as expected.
- Attempt a full build locally (`npm run build`) to verify type-check and production build pipeline succeed; fix any build-time issues discovered.
- Add a CI job or local docs describing how to run unit tests vs e2e tests to avoid future test runner collisions and to clarify developer workflow.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (70% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- The project has strong code-quality infrastructure (ESLint flat config, Prettier, Stylelint, TypeScript and tests) and the codebase is small and well organized. However there are active lint/format warnings and a test-runner conflict where Playwright E2E tests are being loaded by Vitest, causing the test command to fail. These are mostly configuration fixes rather than deep code defects.
- Comprehensive lint/format tooling present: eslint.config.ts with layered configs in config/eslint/, prettier.config.ts and stylelint.config.ts, and package.json scripts for linting and formatting.
- Running ESLint (npm run lint) reported 7 warnings (no errors). Files with warnings include .github/scripts/generate-e2e-stability-summary.js and tests/e2e/app.spec.ts.
- npm run lint:check fails because the repo enforces max-warnings 0 and there are existing warnings; this blocks strict lint checks.
- Prettier format check (npm run format:check) reported code style issues in 3 files; Prettier --write is required to fix them.
- Vitest is configured and unit tests exist and run, but the overall `npm test` runs into a failure due to Playwright tests being imported into the Vitest run.
- The failing test error: 'Playwright Test did not expect test() to be called here.' — caused by tests/e2e/app.spec.ts importing @playwright/test which executes Playwright's test() during Vitest execution.
- Source organization is good: src/app.ts exports an init() function used by tests; main.ts only bootstraps; scripts are test-covered or have tests that simulate behavior (prepare-libraries simulation).
- TypeScript is used with tsconfig files and ESLint is set up to use @typescript-eslint parser and rules (project references configured).
- Error handling is present in app.ts (checks for #app and logs a console.error).
- No obvious code duplication or major naming inconsistencies were observed in the inspected files.

**Next Steps:**
- Fix or suppress ESLint warnings: run `npm run lint:fix`, address remaining warnings (e.g. padding-line-between-statements, unused vars) and re-run `npm run lint:check` until it passes.
- Run Prettier to apply formatting fixes: `npm run format` (or `prettier --write .`) and confirm with `npm run format:check`.
- Resolve the Playwright/Vitest conflict: exclude Playwright E2E tests from Vitest (move them outside Vitest's scan paths or add exclusions in vitest.config.ts) and run Playwright tests with a dedicated script (e.g. `npm run test:e2e` using `playwright test`).
- Add/ensure CI runs the strict verification flow (lint:check, format:check, build, unit tests, and e2e separately) so these issues are caught in PRs.
- Consider adding an explicit .eslintignore / .prettierignore for generated or workflow files, and align ignore patterns across tools to avoid false positives.
- After fixing tooling and test separation, re-run the full test matrix (Vitest unit tests and Playwright e2e) and iterate on any remaining failures or warnings.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (45% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- Project has a reasonably comprehensive test suite (unit tests with Vitest, e2e with Playwright) and coverage config, but the test runners are misconfigured so running npm test fails: Playwright spec files are being imported by Vitest which triggers a Playwright runtime error. Because tests currently fail locally, the testing score is reduced.
- Test files found: tests/*.test.ts (4 files) and tests/e2e/app.spec.ts (Playwright .spec.ts).
- Vitest is configured (vitest.config.ts) and package.json defines test scripts: 'test' -> 'vitest run', plus 'test:coverage' and 'test:ci'. Coverage reporter configured via vitest (v8 provider, json/html/text reporters).
- Project depends on @playwright/test (devDependency) and there is a Playwright test file at tests/e2e/app.spec.ts which imports from '@playwright/test'.
- Running the test script (npm run test) produced a failure: Vitest attempted to import the Playwright spec and Playwright threw: 'Playwright Test did not expect test() to be called here.' (Playwright tests are being executed/imported outside Playwright runner).
- CI GitHub workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) exists and caches Playwright browsers and runs npm run test:ci, but there is no separate npm script for running Playwright tests (no explicit 'playwright test' script). This suggests CI and local test orchestration may be fragile or inconsistent.
- Test setup exists (tests/setup.ts) and many unit tests use Vitest APIs and mocking. Coverage configuration excludes config & scripts directories appropriately.
- Because tests fail when run (local run reproduces the Playwright/Vitest conflict), per assessment rules the score must be ≤50% despite having tests and coverage configured.

**Next Steps:**
- Prevent Vitest from importing Playwright tests. E.g. update vitest.config.ts to exclude the e2e directory (exclude: ['tests/e2e/**', ...]) or tighten Vitest include patterns so only unit tests are picked up.
- Run Playwright tests with the Playwright runner instead of Vitest. Add explicit npm scripts: 'test:unit': 'vitest run', 'test:e2e': 'playwright test', and a composite 'test' or CI flow that runs them separately.
- Update CI to run unit tests (Vitest) and e2e tests (Playwright) as distinct steps, capturing artifacts and exit codes separately. Ensure Playwright browser installation/caching steps remain in place for e2e.
- After fixing runner separation, run tests locally (npm run test:unit && npm run test:e2e) and fix any failing tests. Re-run npm run test:ci to validate CI parity.
- Consider adding a coverage threshold in vitest config and failing the CI job if coverage drops below acceptable levels; add clearer documentation to README or CONTRIBUTING about how to run unit vs e2e tests locally.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (70% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The project builds cleanly and unit tests (Vitest) can run, but end-to-end execution and test orchestration have issues: the preview server was not reachable during testing, and running the full test command fails because Playwright e2e tests are being picked up by Vitest (causing a test-runner conflict). Runtime error handling in the app is present (graceful handling when #app is missing). Overall execution is good for local development and building, but test orchestration and e2e execution need fixes.
- Build: npm run build completed successfully (vite produced dist assets). Output shows dist/index.html and asset files were built.
- Node/npm environment: node v22.17.1 and npm 10.9.2 (matches package.json engine requirement >=22.17.0).
- Unit tests: Running an individual Vitest file succeeded (npx vitest run tests/main.test.ts passed).
- Full test run: npm run test (which runs `vitest run`) failed. The failure is caused by a Playwright e2e test (tests/e2e/app.spec.ts) that imports '@playwright/test' — Playwright throws 'Playwright Test did not expect test() to be called here', causing the entire npm test to fail.
- Playwright config: playwright.config.ts expects baseURL 'http://localhost:5173' for e2e tests, indicating the e2e tests require a running preview server.
- Preview server: Attempts to start / reach the preview server during automated checks failed — headless browser test returned net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED at http://127.0.0.1:5173. A background start attempt returned a PID but there was no successful verification that the server responded.
- App runtime handling: src/app.ts checks for the #app element and logs an error and returns if missing — good defensive behavior and clear error logging.
- Console noise during tests: Importing src/main.ts during tests emits 'Voder website starting...' to console, which was visible in test output; this indicates side effects at module import time (the main entry will call init depending on readyState) which can pollute test output.
- Test selection / runner configuration: vitest.config.ts is present and uses a custom jsdom config, but Playwright e2e tests are stored under tests/e2e and are being discovered by the test runner used in npm run test, causing runner mismatch.
- Artifacts: dist files are present (but were filtered by ignore patterns when listing), and vitest coverage config exists (coverage provider v8).

**Next Steps:**
- Fix test orchestration: exclude Playwright e2e tests from Vitest runs (e.g., move Playwright tests outside Vitest's testDir, add explicit test pattern exclusions in vitest.config, or run Playwright tests with `npx playwright test` instead of via Vitest).
- Make e2e execution deterministic: add scripts that start the preview server and wait for it to be healthy before running Playwright tests (e.g., a script to run `vite preview` in background and poll http://localhost:5173/ until responsive). Update CI to start the server prior to e2e tests.
- Add a dedicated npm script for e2e (e.g., `npm run e2e:ci`) that starts preview, runs `npx playwright test`, captures artifacts, and tears down the server.
- Reduce side effects in modules used by tests: avoid console output and immediate side effects on module import (move console.warn or init logic behind explicit entry points or guard them in test environments), or mock them in tests to avoid noisy output and cross-run interference.
- Improve preview/server logs and health-checks: ensure the preview command writes accessible logs and add a `health-check` script (or expand existing scripts/health-check.js) to verify the server is up before tests run.
- Document test commands in README/CI config: explicitly document how to run unit tests vs e2e locally and in CI to avoid accidental runner conflicts and to make required steps clear for contributors.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (70% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Documentation coverage is solid for developer onboarding and design decisions (README, DEVELOPER-SETUP, ADRs, many library HOWTOs), but there are problems with quality, consistency and missing pieces: many Markdown lint issues across docs, no API reference, no changelog/release notes, limited inline docstrings, and e2e/test documentation/scripts are incomplete.
- README.md is present and contains a clear Quick start, commands for dev/build/preview/type-check/test/lint/format and troubleshooting guidance (verified file: README.md).
- Developer onboarding: docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md exists and documents install, verification sequence, CI recommendations and troubleshooting for verification steps (verified file: docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md).
- Architectural documentation: a set of Architectural Decision Records (docs/decisions) is present (multiple accepted ADR markdown files found).
- Library/implementation docs: docs/libraries contains many per-dependency markdown documents (dozens of files).
- Security guidance: SECURITY.md and audit artifacts references exist (SECURITY.md present).
- Doc quality tooling shows problems: running markdown lint (npm run lint:md) fails with many MDX/markdownlint errors across docs/libraries and README (reported multiple MD041, MD010, MD033, MD009, etc.).
- Running tests (npm test) failed: Playwright E2E test file caused the test run to fail when run via the project's default test command (indicative that running all tests as-is is fragile); this points to incomplete separation or documentation of test workflows. (Observed failing Playwright test during test run.)
- No API documentation / reference found: search for API docs returned none and there are no dedicated API reference files or OpenAPI specs.
- No CHANGELOG or release notes file was found in the repository (no CHANGELOG*.md detected).
- Source code has minimal inline comments (small explanatory comments in src/*), but no formal docstrings or JSDoc/TSDoc blocks for exported functions (src/app.ts/main.ts have short comments only).
- There are package.json scripts for docs (docs:setup, docs:report) and verify, but there is no CONTRIBUTING.md or RELEASE.md describing release or contribution processes.

**Next Steps:**
- Fix markdown lint failures: run npm run lint:md, address the top markdownlint errors in docs/libraries and README (MD041, MD033, MD010, MD009 etc.) to improve style and allow automated doc checks to pass.
- Add an API reference if applicable: create API docs (OpenAPI, typed reference, or generated TSDoc output) for any public runtime interfaces or exported modules.
- Add a changelog/release notes file (CHANGELOG.md) and a simple release process doc explaining how releases are created and tagged (or adopt conventional-changelog tooling).
- Improve inline documentation: add TSDoc/JSDoc comments to exported functions/classes in src/ so code and docs stay synchronized and can be surfaced by automatic tooling.
- Document testing workflows: add explicit scripts and docs for running unit tests, coverage, and E2E (separate npm scripts for playwright e2e vs vitest unit tests) and update DEVELOPER-SETUP.md with E2E instructions.
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md that describes contribution workflow, how to run doc checks locally, and how to update ADRs and library docs.
- Run the repository verify sequence locally (npm run verify) after fixes and add CI checks that validate markdown linting, formatting and docs build so regressions are prevented.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are well-declared and managed: package.json lists production and dev dependencies, a lockfile and node_modules are present, automated dependency/security tooling (Dependabot and GitHub Actions audit) is configured, and an npm audit run produced no vulnerabilities. Minor gaps: I could not run a full outdated/upgrade analysis in this environment (npm outdated failed) and package-lock.json contents were not directly readable here, limiting a deeper freshness analysis.
- package.json exists and declares production dependencies (@microsoft/clarity, gsap, three) and a comprehensive set of devDependencies (eslint, vitest, @playwright/test, typescript, prettier, stylelint, etc.).
- package-lock.json is present in the repository root (presence detected) and node_modules/ exists in the workspace (checked).
- npm audit --json was executed in this environment and returned no vulnerabilities (vulnerabilities: {}), with metadata showing total dependencies: prod:27, dev:743, optional:106, peer:27 (total:769).
- npm ls --json ran successfully and shows installed top-level packages; installed versions match declared ranges (examples: three@0.180.0, gsap@3.13.0, @microsoft/clarity@1.0.0).
- .github/workflows/security-audit.yml is configured to run npm audit daily, parse results, attempt SBOM generation, and upload artifacts for triage.
- .github/dependabot.yml is configured to run weekly for npm updates and open PRs for dependency updates.
- scripts/health-check.js validates engines, presence of package-lock.json and node_modules, and runs type-check/lint/format checks, showing attention to reproducible environment checks.
- I attempted npm outdated --json but the command failed in this environment; package-lock.json contents were excluded from direct reading here, limiting a full outdated/upgrade analysis.

**Next Steps:**
- Run npm outdated --json (locally or in CI with network access and readable lockfile) to identify outdated packages and prioritize upgrades.
- Regularly review and test Dependabot PRs; consider enabling auto-merge for non-breaking/minor updates that pass CI and tests.
- When applying fixes (e.g., npm audit fix), review package-lock.json diffs carefully and run the repository verify pipeline before committing lockfile changes.
- Add a scheduled CI job to produce an 'outdated' report artifact (weekly) to detect stale major/minor versions proactively.
- Audit devDependencies and remove or consolidate unused tooling; consider moving large dev-only tools to CI-only workflows to reduce local install footprint and transitive dependencies.
- Continue running and triaging automated scans (security audit, secret-scan, CodeQL) and reviewing SBOM/artifacts as part of ongoing dependency management.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Overall security posture is good for a small static site: automated security workflows (npm audit, gitleaks secret-scan, CodeQL), Dependabot, SBOM generation, and local audit tooling are present and configured. Local/npm audit shows zero vulnerabilities and no obvious hardcoded secrets were found. Some gaps remain (no Content-Security-Policy or explicit HTTP->HTTPS enforcement in repo, use of innerHTML, large dev-dependency surface in CI, and limited repository-level protections visible from the code).
- Automated security workflows present in .github/workflows: security-audit.yml (daily npm audit, SBOM), secret-scan.yml (gitleaks daily scan + fail-on-detection), code-scanning.yml (CodeQL), and dependabot configuration (.github/dependabot.yml).
- Local/npm audit run shows no vulnerabilities: audit.json and npm audit output indicate 0 critical/high/moderate/low/info vulnerabilities (audit.json metadata: total vulnerabilities = 0).
- .github/scripts/parse-audit.js is present and enforces fail-on-high/critical (script exits non-zero when high/critical advisories found) and is used by the security-audit workflow.
- Secret scanning artifacts exist (repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt and repo-secrets-scan.txt) and the gitleaks workflow is configured to redact and to fail the run if secrets are detected. The redacted artifact files in the repo are empty (no obvious findings checked in).
- No obvious hardcoded secrets were discovered by repository-wide grep for common secret keywords (API_KEY, SECRET, SENTRY, TOKEN, PASSWORD, AWS_ACCESS, AWS_SECRET, PRIVATE_KEY, BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY).
- CI uses a secret for Sentry (VITE_SENTRY_DSN is provided from GitHub secrets in .github/workflows/ci.yml) rather than hardcoding it into the repo which indicates correct secret handling for that integration.
- Pre-commit hook (.husky/pre-commit) enforces format/lint/type-check to reduce accidental insecure code being committed.
- Playwright/CI and other workflows capture artifacts for triage (audit artifacts, codeql SARIF, secrets scan artifacts, e2e artifacts). SBOM generation is attempted in the audit workflow (npx @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-bom || true).
- Repository contains many devDependencies which increase the CI attack surface; although npm audit reports no vulnerabilities now, large dev-dep surface should be monitored continuously.
- app.ts assigns static content via innerHTML (app.innerHTML = `...`), which is fine for static content but would be an XSS risk if any of that content later included untrusted input — use of innerHTML should be noted and reviewed when code evolves to include dynamic/untrusted content.
- No repository-level enforcement settings (branch protection, required status checks, mandatory approved reviews, mandatory CodeQL enforcement) are visible in repo files — those are GitHub-level settings and not present here to inspect.
- No explicit Content-Security-Policy or other security headers are set in repo (this is typically provided by hosting), and the repo does not include server config enforcing HTTPS (again typically handled by hosting).

**Next Steps:**
- Enable/verify GitHub repository protections: require status checks for CI, require CodeQL/snyk/audit success, require approved reviews, and enable branch protection to prevent direct pushes to main.
- Add a Content-Security-Policy (CSP) meta tag or recommend CSP and secure headers for the hosting environment (e.g., CSP, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security) and document recommended headers in repo docs.
- Replace innerHTML usage with safer DOM APIs if you later introduce dynamic or user-controlled content (e.g., createElement/textContent) to avoid XSS risks; audit any future use of innerHTML before merging.
- Restrict the production dependency surface in CI: run npm audit focusing on production dependencies before releases and consider scanning dev dependencies used in CI (already done) but periodically review and remove unnecessary devDeps.
- Make SBOM generation a required artifact and store it in a central place for supply-chain audits; ensure the SBOM is generated successfully (remove the || true that masks SBOM generation failures if you want it required).
- Consider adding a pre-commit secret scan (gitleaks or git-secrets) to block secrets locally before pushing, and ensure the CI secret-scan workflow remains configured to fail on detection.
- Enable/confirm retention and access controls on uploaded artifacts in Actions (audit who can download artifacts) and rotate any exposed secrets immediately if any scans ever report tokens present.
- Document the security maintenance process in SECURITY.md with owners, triage steps, and SLAs for critical/high findings (the file already contains triage guidance—consider adding escalation contacts and required timelines).

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Good, well-structured git usage with sensible commit messages, active branches and tags, CI workflows and pre-commit checks. Minor issues: working directory is not clean (local .voder artifacts and test results are modified/untracked), a few ephemeral files appear to be tracked, and there is no .gitattributes. Overall high quality but a few housekeeping items remain.
- Git working branch: fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage (tracked to origin/fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage).
- Git status shows modifications and untracked local artifacts: 'M .voder/history.md', 'M .voder/last-action.md', and untracked '.voder/.processes.json' and 'playwright-results.json' (clean working tree not satisfied).
- Commit history is present and readable; recent commits follow conventional commit-style messages (examples: 'chore(deps): add @playwright/test devDependency', 'test(e2e): add Playwright E2E test and workflow').
- Multiple branches exist (local + remotes) and recent activity is visible; main and feature/fix branches present. Git for-each-ref output shows recent commits by 'voder-bot' and some by 'Tom Howard'.
- Tags are present: 'v1.0.0-complete' and 'v1.0.1' (v1.0.1 authored by Tom Howard on 2025-08-20).
- Remote configured: origin -> https://github.com/mountain-pass/voder.ai-website.git (fetch & push).
- .gitignore exists and contains good defaults for node projects (node_modules/, dist/, coverage/, logs, env files, etc.).
- Pre-commit hook present (.husky/pre-commit) enforcing format:check, lint:check and type-check which is a strong quality gate.
- Important repository files are tracked (package.json, README.md, GitHub workflows under .github/workflows).
- Some repository-specific ephemeral directory (.voder) contains tracked files and also many ignored files (listing showed many .voder files filtered by ignore patterns). This is a potential source of accidental commits of transient data.
- No .gitattributes file was found (no configuration discovered for e.g. consistent line endings, export-ignore, diff attributes).
- git user.name and user.email are configured to 'voder-bot' / 'voder-bot@example.com' in this environment; many recent automated commits are by that bot account.

**Next Steps:**
- Clean the working directory: commit or discard the intended changes in .voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md, and either remove or permanently ignore ephemeral files (git rm --cached .voder/.processes.json; add patterns to .gitignore or .voderignore).
- Decide whether .voder artifacts should be tracked. If they are purely runtime/debug data, add .voder/ to .gitignore (or update .voderignore) and remove them from the index (git rm --cached) to avoid future accidental commits.
- Add a .gitattributes file to lock down line endings and any export/diff rules (useful for consistent behavior across contributors and CI).
- Consider adding CONTRIBUTING.md or a commit message linting (commitlint) policy if you want to enforce commit conventions beyond current practice; also consider enabling signed commits or documenting authoring expectations.
- Verify that pre-commit hooks are installed for developers (husky prepare step) and consider adding a CI check that fails when working-directory has uncommitted changes in PRs (to prevent accidental commits of ephemeral files).
- Perform a quick secret-scan and large-file check on history (BFG/git-filter-repo) if there is a chance ephemeral data or secrets were committed previously.
- Optional: add a .gitattributes export-ignore entries for large artifacts in the .git directory (if any) and confirm branch protection rules on the remote repository (cannot be checked locally) to ensure main/trunk are protected.
