# Implementation Progress Report

**Assessment Date**: 2025-10-15T13:17:24
**Assessment Status**: **⚠️ NEEDS RESOLUTION - DEPENDENCIES**

## Phase 1: Dependencies Validation (COMPLETED)

### Smart Version Selection Algorithm Results

Applied the Smart Version Selection Algorithm to analyze outdated dependencies:

#### Upgrade Recommendations (MATURE - >=7 days old):

✅ **@playwright/test**: 1.55.1 → 1.56.0
- Release Date: 2025-10-06 (9 days ago)
- Status: MATURE - Safe to upgrade
- Security Impact: No known vulnerabilities in current or target version

#### No Upgrade Recommended (FRESH - <7 days old):

❌ **vite**: 7.1.9 → 7.1.10  
- Release Date: 2025-10-14 (1 day ago)
- Status: FRESH - Below 7-day maturity threshold
- Security Impact: No security benefit (no vulnerabilities in current version)
- Decision: MAINTAIN current version per Smart Selection Algorithm

#### Additional Outdated Dependencies:

**Pending Analysis**:
- @types/node: 24.6.2 → 24.7.2
- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin: 8.46.0 → 8.46.1  
- @typescript-eslint/parser: 8.46.0 → 8.46.1
- axe-core: 4.10.3 → 4.11.0

### Security Assessment

**Current State**: 2 low-severity vulnerabilities detected
- **Package**: fast-redact (transitive dependency via netlify-cli)
- **Issue**: Prototype pollution vulnerabilities
- **Severity**: LOW (not moderate or higher)
- **Impact**: Development dependency only, no production impact
- **Assessment**: Does not constitute critical security vulnerability requiring immediate action

### Phase 1 Status: BLOCKED

**Reason**: Smart Version Selection Algorithm applied successfully, but upgrade work required for mature packages.

**Next Actions Required**:
1. Apply @playwright/test upgrade (1.55.1 → 1.56.0) - MATURE and safe
2. Complete analysis of remaining outdated dependencies using Smart Selection Algorithm
3. Implement approved upgrades
4. Re-run security audit to verify vulnerability status

## Assessment Decision: SKIP TO PHASE 11 (REPORT)

Per assessment instructions, dependencies issues found - proceeding directly to Phase 11 report generation without continuing other assessment phases.
