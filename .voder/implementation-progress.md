![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (56.75% ± 10% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The repository has a solid foundation (TypeScript, Vite, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest config, ADRs and design assets) but fails to meet required quality gates. The main blockers are: no test suites present, dependency assessment missing (0%), and multiple verification thresholds (functionality, testing, dependencies, version control) are well below the 90% requirement. Follow-up work should focus on small, verifiable steps (add a minimal Vitest DOM test and a health-check script, ensure package-lock/node_modules presence, and stabilize dependency installation) to make the verification pipeline runnable locally and in CI.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Add a minimal co-located Vitest DOM test (tests/main.test.ts) and a non-interactive health-check script, run npm run test and npm run health-check locally to unblock CI verification.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (68% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- The project implements a minimal static website with a clear main entry (index.html -> src/main.ts) and styling; it can likely be served/built with Vite. However automated tests are missing (Vitest reports "No test files found") and CI test/coverage commands fail due to absent tests and strict coverage thresholds. A referenced favicon asset is missing and there are numerous source-map warnings from an external config during test runs. No server/API or CLI functionality is present.
- Main entry point exists: src/main.ts initializes the #app element and injects page content.
- index.html correctly references /src/main.ts and contains the #app container.
- Styling is provided in src/style.css and defines layout/brand variables.
- package.json contains dev/build/preview/type-check/test scripts (vite, tsc, vitest) and a comprehensive verify pipeline.
- Running npm run test:ci failed: Vitest output shows "No test files found" and global coverage thresholds were not met (lines/statements 0%), causing the task to exit with errors.
- Vite/test run produced many source-map warnings referencing config/dist/*.d.ts.map files that are missing from an external config package (non-fatal but noisy).
- Referenced favicon (/voder-favicon.png) is not present in the repository (check returned 'does not exist'), which will produce a 404 when serving the site.
- No API endpoints, server code, or CLI entry points were found — repository is a static front-end site only.
- scripts/prepare-libraries.js exists and is functional, showing some tooling to copy/link package READMEs from node_modules.
- Git history is present and recent, indicating active development; some internal .voder files are ignored and not readable in this environment.

**Next Steps:**
- Add at least one test file (unit or DOM/smoke) so Vitest discovers tests and the test command succeeds; then iterate to increase coverage to desired thresholds.
- Temporarily relax or adjust coverage thresholds in CI (or add meaningful tests) to avoid failing builds while test suite is being created.
- Add the missing favicon asset or remove/update the <link> reference in index.html to avoid a 404 in production.
- Run npm run dev and npm run build locally to confirm the site serves and builds; investigate and, if necessary, resolve the external source-map warnings (install/match config package versions or suppress map loading).
- Document expected runtime behavior and developer setup in README (how to run dev server, build, and run tests) and add a simple smoke test that asserts the rendered H1 or #app content.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (72% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Good baseline tooling and conventions are in place (ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint, HTMLHint, TypeScript), and type-checking passes. However there are active lint warnings, Prettier formatting issues, no tests present (Vitest reports "No test files found"), and test/coverage commands fail the repository's thresholds. Overall code is small and well-structured, but enforcement gaps and missing tests reduce the CODE_QUALITY score.
- Lint configuration exists and is fairly comprehensive: eslint.config.ts + config/eslint/* (base, dx, performance) and package.json scripts (lint, lint:fix, lint:check).
- Running npm run lint produced 3 warnings and 0 errors (ESLint output): scripts/prepare-libraries.js (unused 'os' var and a console), src/main.ts (console.log and console.error) — npm run lint printed: "✖ 3 problems (0 errors, 3 warnings)".
- Prettier check (npm run format:check) reported style issues in 5 files (example: scripts/prepare-libraries.js and several .voder/* markdown files). Output: "Code style issues found in 5 files. Run Prettier with --write to fix."
- Type-check (npm run type-check) produced no output/errors — project compiles/type-checks with configured tsconfig(s).
- Tests are missing: running npm test (Vitest) fails with: "No test files found, exiting with code 1" — there are no *.test.* or *.spec.* source test files in the repo.
- Test coverage commands fail: npm run test:coverage / test:ci emit many sourcemap warnings (missing config/dist/*.d.ts.map files) and final coverage errors because no tests exist; coverage thresholds (90%) are not met.
- Project structure is minimal and clean: src/main.ts and src/style.css with straightforward initialization logic; code is readable and uses TypeScript types for DOM queries.
- Error handling is present but minimal: main.ts checks for #app and logs an error then returns; scripts/prepare-libraries.js uses try/catch and exit codes. There is one unused import (os) in scripts/prepare-libraries.js causing a lint warning.
- Stylelint, HTMLHint and Prettier configs exist (stylelint.config.ts, htmlhint.config.js, prettier.config.ts) and htmlhint reported no errors for HTML.
- A noisy build/test environment: Vitest/Vite try to read source maps under config/dist that are not present, causing many warnings during test/coverage runs — this adds friction to CI/test runs.

**Next Steps:**
- Fix lint warnings: remove unused imports (scripts/prepare-libraries.js: remove 'os' import) and eliminate unintended console.log uses or change to allowed methods (warn/error) per ESLint rules. Re-run eslint and ensure lint:check passes.
- Run Prettier to auto-fix formatting issues (npm run format) and add a pre-commit or CI check to prevent regressions (format:check as part of CI).
- Add tests (unit and/or integration) for main app behavior (e.g., DOM mounting logic) and any reusable functions. Ensure at least minimal coverage so vitest run no longer fails with "No test files found".
- Either adjust or remove overly-strict coverage thresholds temporarily, or (preferably) add tests to meet the project's thresholds. Investigate and remove/resolve the missing source map warnings from config/dist (build or adjust imports) so test runs are quieter and more reliable.
- Add CI pipeline steps that run type-check, lint:check, format:check, and tests (test:ci) to enforce quality gates on PRs.
- Consider adding pre-commit hooks (husky, lint-staged) to auto-run formatting and basic linting before commits.
- Increase automated checks for duplication, complexity (e.g., SonarCloud or CodeQL) only once a larger codebase exists; for now keep rules focused on linting, formatting, and tests.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (30% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- The repository is configured for testing (Vitest + testing-library + coverage config and setup), but there are no actual test suites found and tests could not be executed in this environment. Test scaffolding exists (setup files and configs) but no *.test.* or *.spec.* files or test implementations, so test coverage and pass/fail status are currently unknown.
- package.json defines test scripts using vitest ("test", "test:watch", "test:coverage", "test:ci").
- devDependencies include test tooling: vitest, @testing-library/dom, @testing-library/jest-dom, @vitest/coverage-v8, happy-dom, jest-axe — the project is prepared for testing.
- vitest.config.ts and config/vitest.config.ts exist and reference setupFiles and coverage configuration (provider v8, reporters, thresholds configured in config/vitest.config.ts).
- tests/setup.ts exists and imports @testing-library/jest-dom and clears the DOM between tests (setup only, no test cases).
- Searches found zero test files: no files matching **/*.test.*, **/*.spec.*, and no substantive test files under tests/ (only setup.ts).
- src contains main.ts (simple DOM initialization) with no corresponding tests.
- coverage/ directory exists but is empty (no collected coverage artifacts present).
- Attempt to run npm test in this environment failed (test command did not run successfully), so actual test run results are unavailable here.
- No CI workflows (.github/workflows) were found in this checkout to show recent test runs or failures.

**Next Steps:**
- Write unit tests: add tests for app behaviour (e.g., src/main.test.ts) that exercise DOM initialization and core logic. Start with small, fast unit tests using Vitest + testing-library.
- Install dev dependencies and run tests locally or in CI: run npm ci (or npm install) then npm run test and npm run test:coverage to verify tests run and collect coverage.
- Ensure at least minimal coverage: add tests covering key functionality and aim to meet the thresholds in vitest config (or adjust thresholds to match realistic targets while improving coverage over time).
- Add CI pipeline to run tests and coverage on push/PR (e.g., GitHub Actions) and fail builds when tests fail or coverage thresholds are not met.
- Expand test types as the project grows: add integration tests for critical flows and consider an e2e solution (Playwright, Cypress) for browser interactions.
- If npm test fails in your environment, capture and share the npm test output (stderr/stdout) and ensure node/npm versions and dependencies are installed. Make sure any ignored configuration files required for test setup are committed (some config/testing files appear ignored).
- Maintain the tests: add tests for future features, run tests in pre-merge CI, and include test/coverage checks in the project's verify script.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (72% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The project builds successfully (TypeScript + Vite) and produces a clean production bundle in dist. The runtime code is small and contains basic error handling, but there are no test files and the dev/preview servers could not be started in this environment (spawn timeout). Overall execution is solid for a small static site but lacks automated tests and some runtime/startup validation.
- npm run build succeeded: tsc -p tsconfig.build.json && vite build completed and generated dist with index.html, assets, favicon, and logos.
- Vite build reported 4 modules transformed and produced JS/CSS assets (dist/assets/main-*.js, main-*.css) and sourcemaps; no build warnings/errors observed.
- src contains a minimal client app (src/main.ts) and styles (src/style.css). main.ts logs startup and guards for a missing #app element with console.error and early return.
- npm test (Vitest) failed because no test files were found; repository has testing configs (config/testing) but no **/*.test.* or **/*.spec.* files.
- npm run dev and npm run preview failed here with spawnSync /bin/sh ETIMEDOUT — indicates the execution environment used for this assessment could not launch the dev/preview server; the project provides standard vite dev/preview scripts.
- Configuration files (vite.config.ts, tsconfig.*, vitest.config.ts) are present and appear correctly configured (aliases, build outDir, test environment settings).
- Package.json includes a comprehensive verify script (type-check, lint, build, test:ci) which would fail in CI due to missing tests unless adjusted.

**Next Steps:**
- Add automated tests (unit/smoke) so vitest discovers tests. Start with a basic DOM smoke test that mounts src/main.ts and asserts expected content in #app.
- Run and verify npm run dev and npm run preview locally (or in CI with proper permissions) to confirm dev/preview servers start without timeouts; if environment-limited, provide a lightweight static-preview script.
- Integrate CI (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run build, lint, and tests on each push/PR; update verify script if tests are intentionally omitted.
- Improve runtime observability: add simple logging and user-facing fallbacks for critical runtime failures as the app grows beyond a static landing page.
- If tests cannot be added immediately, modify the verify/test scripts to avoid failing CI (or document the testing strategy) so automated pipelines remain green.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (65% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is partially present: strong architectural decision records (MADR) and some inline code comments exist, but the project lacks a top-level README, API docs, changelog, and contributor guidance. Some documentation-related tooling referenced in package.json appears incomplete or points to missing scripts/files.
- No top-level README.md found at project root. The only README discovered is assets/satoshi/README.md (fonts installation instructions).
- Architectural documentation present: docs/decisions contains many MADR files (e.g. docs/decisions/0000-use-markdown-architectural-decision-records-madr-40.accepted.md and numerous other accepted ADRs).
- Code contains useful comments and JSDoc-style blocks in several files (example: config/testing/helpers.ts includes explanatory comments; config/eslint/base.ts has header comments; src/main.ts contains brief inline comments).
- No CHANGELOG or release notes file found (no CHANGELOG.md or similar).
- No API documentation discovered (no api.md, docs/api, TypeDoc config, or generated API site).
- package.json references documentation tooling and files: lint:md targets README.md, docs/**/*.md, specs/**/*.md; scripts include docs:setup (node setup-package-docs.js --all) and docs:report, but setup-package-docs.js was not found in the repository — indicates docs tooling is incomplete or missing.
- No CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, or guidelines for contributors found.
- Documentation and tooling are partially consistent (presence of markdown lint config .markdownlint.json and markdown lint scripts) but lacking the required content to satisfy those scripts (e.g., missing top-level README).

**Next Steps:**
- Add a root README.md with project overview, quickstart (dev/build/preview), usage notes, and links to important docs (ADR folder, contributing, tests, license).
- Create CONTRIBUTING.md (and optionally CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) describing how to contribute, run tests/lint, commit message style, and PR process.
- Add API documentation (e.g., a docs/api.md or generate TypeDoc for public modules) and document any public interfaces, configuration options, and deployment notes.
- Add a CHANGELOG.md or release notes practice (and a script/workflow to update it) to track releases and important changes.
- Either provide the referenced scripts/tools (e.g., setup-package-docs.js) or remove/update package.json scripts that reference missing files so docs tooling is functional and reproducible.
- Improve inline documentation where public-facing code exists: add JSDoc/type comments for exported functions/modules and ensure code comments are kept up to date as code changes.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (0% ± 20% COMPLETE)
- Assessment failed due to error: Assessment was cancelled
- Error occurred during DEPENDENCIES assessment: Assessment was cancelled

**Next Steps:**
- Check assessment system configuration
- Verify project accessibility

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (72% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The project is a small static front-end site with no detected open npm vulnerabilities and no obvious hardcoded secrets. However it lacks several standard security hardening measures (CSP/secure headers, HTTPS configuration guidance, production source-map exposure) and contains a minor XSS risk pattern (use of innerHTML). There are also no automated security checks (Dependabot/secret scanning/CI security jobs) configured in the repository.
- npm audit --json returned zero vulnerabilities (auditReportVersion: 2, vulnerabilities: {}). (evidence: npm audit run output)
- No .env files or environment files checked into the repo; search for typical secret names (API_KEY, secret) found no matches. (evidence: repository file listing & search attempts)
- src/main.ts uses element.innerHTML to inject markup: app.innerHTML = `...`. While content is static today, innerHTML is a vector for XSS if content becomes dynamic. (evidence: src/main.ts)
- vite.config.ts sets build.sourcemap: true — generating and deploying source maps in production can expose source code and potentially secrets/logic. (evidence: vite.config.ts)
- Vite dev server config does not enable HTTPS (server.https not set) — dev server will run over HTTP by default. Production hosting/platform must enforce HTTPS; there is no guidance in the repo. (evidence: vite.config.ts)
- index.html contains no Content-Security-Policy or other security-related meta tags/headers; repository contains no server configuration adding secure headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.). (evidence: index.html and repo listing)
- Project includes an analytics dependency (@microsoft/clarity). Analytics can introduce privacy/PII and tracking concerns if configured incorrectly — no code using it is present, but the dependency exists. (evidence: package.json dependencies)
- No CI/security pipeline or Dependabot/automated dependency update configuration was found in the repository. No secret scanning or automated audit steps are present. (evidence: repository file listing — no .github/workflows or dependabot config found)
- No input validation or authentication/authorization to inspect — the project is a static site with no backend endpoints. This reduces some attack surface but also means any future API integrations must be reviewed for auth and validation.
- No CDNs or third-party script inclusions found in index.html (script is local). If external resources are added later, SRI and CSP will be recommended.

**Next Steps:**
- Disable or limit production source maps: set build.sourcemap to false for production builds or ensure .map files are never deployed publicly.
- Add a Content-Security-Policy (CSP) and other secure headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy) at the server or hosting layer; if using static hosting, configure these headers via platform settings.
- Avoid using innerHTML for dynamic content. Use textContent or DOM APIs to insert user or external data. Audit any future dynamic insertion points for XSS.
- Ensure all deployments/hosts serve traffic over HTTPS and enable HSTS. Add docs or CI checks to enforce TLS usage for deployments.
- Add automated security checks in CI: run npm audit during CI, enable Dependabot (or equivalent) for dependency updates, and consider SCA tools (Snyk, GitHub Advanced Security) and secret scanning (gitleaks, GitHub secret scanning).
- Review third-party analytics (Microsoft Clarity) configuration to ensure no PII is collected; consider limiting or gating analytics until privacy review is complete.
- Introduce pre-commit hooks and linters that include security-oriented rules (e.g., eslint-plugin-security, custom rules for avoiding innerHTML) and add a security section to contributing docs.
- If/when a backend is added, add authentication/authorization review, input validation, parameterized queries, rate limiting, and run a server-side security scanner (e.g., bandit for Python, Brakeman for Rails).
- Add automated tests or CI jobs that check for accidentally committed secrets and sensitive files (.env, keys) before merging (secret scanning + blocklist).
- Document a minimal security checklist for releases (sourcemap handling, CSP, HTTPS, dependency audit) and make it part of the verify/build pipeline.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (75% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Repository is a healthy git repo with a clear, conventional commit history and a solid .gitignore, but there are some version-control hygiene issues: a dirty working tree (modified and untracked files), at least one local commit ahead of origin, multiple local cleanup branches not pushed/merged, and no visible commit hooks or CI workflow files. Overall good practices are evident (structured commit messages, tracked lockfile), but the working directory and branch hygiene need attention.
- Repository present (.git directory exists) and git is available (git version 2.47.0).
- Commit history is well-formed and descriptive (conventional-style messages like feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:). Recent commits shown, e.g. HEAD: '0618595 removed secrets' and many other meaningful commits.
- Git status shows a non-clean working directory: several tracked files are modified (M .voder/history.md, M .voder/image-descriptions.json, M .voder/implementation-progress.md, M .voder/last-action.md, M .voder/plan.md, M package.json).
- There are untracked files/dirs present (?? .voder/progress-chart.png, ?? .voder/progress-log-areas.csv, ?? .voder/progress-log.csv, ?? scripts/).
- Local branch 'main' is ahead of origin/main by 1 commit (local HEAD '0618595' ahead of remote '8d18871').
- Multiple local branches exist (cleanup/...) but remote only shows origin/main; suggests local branch clutter or branches not pushed.
- .gitignore file exists and is comprehensive (ignores node_modules, dist, env files, coverage, IDE files, temporary folders, etc.).
- package.json and package-lock.json are tracked; package-lock.json is present (tracked).
- No .husky hooks found in repository (no .husky/** files detected), yet git config core.hookspath is set to .husky/_ — hooks expected but not committed/installed.
- No visible GitHub Actions workflows or .github directory in project root (no CI workflow files found in repository root listing).
- git config shows both developer and bot user info present (Tom Howard and voder-bot), which may reflect CI or automation usage but is not an error.

**Next Steps:**
- Clean the working directory: commit or stash the modified tracked files (review .voder/* tracked files — many are ephemeral/planning artifacts; consider removing them from version control if appropriate).
- Add ephemeral or tooling files (if not already) to .gitignore and remove them from tracking with 'git rm --cached' where appropriate (e.g., large images, progress artifacts) to avoid noise in commits.
- Push local commits and synchronize branches with remote (git push) or delete/archive local cleanup branches that are no longer needed to improve branch hygiene.
- If you intend to use hooks, add and commit a .husky/ directory (or update core.hookspath) so pre-commit/pre-push checks can run consistently for contributors.
- Add or enable CI workflows (GitHub Actions or equivalent) to enforce tests/lints on push/PRs if not present — repository currently has no visible workflow files.
- Add repository-level documentation (root README, contributing guidelines, branch strategy) if missing so new contributors understand workflow and branch policies.
- Verify that the 'removed secrets' commit actually removed sensitive data from history; if secrets were committed previously, consider using git-filter-repo/BFG and rotating any leaked credentials.
- Regularly prune and clean stale local branches; adopt a branching policy (feature/bugfix/release naming) and protect main on remote to enforce merge controls.
