![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (71.75% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The repository is well-structured and largely functional: build, unit tests, linting, security scans, ADRs, and CI orchestration are present and mostly working. Key strengths are strong CI/security automation, comprehensive ADRs, and a passing unit test suite. The implementation is INCOMPLETE because the DEPENDENCIES assessment failed (0%) and several required thresholds (90%+ for Functionality/Testing/Execution/Dependencies/Version Control and 80%+ for Code Quality/Documentation/Security) were not met. Testing and coverage need targeted expansion, small lint/format housekeeping remains, and the dependency assessment needs investigation so that dependency health and automated verification can be validated.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Investigate and fix the DEPENDENCIES assessment failure: run the repository dependency scanner (npm audit/parse scripts) with the generated artifacts and ensure package-lock.json and audit outputs are accessible to the automated assessor so dependency health can be validated.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- This is a small static Vite site with clear main entry points, working unit tests, and a successful production build. Core functionality (rendering the pre-launch page) is implemented and verified by tests and the build. Minor issues: the preview command timed out in this environment and Playwright e2e tests were present but were not executed here, so end-to-end verification is incomplete.
- Main entry points exist: src/main.ts (loads ./app.js) and src/app.ts (exported init() that injects content into #app).
- index.html contains <div id="app"></div> and references /src/main.ts as the module entry.
- Styling in src/style.css provides the visible layout and brand colors used by the app.
- Unit tests run successfully: `npm run test` output showed 4 test files, 14 tests passed (Vitest v3.2.4).
- Production build succeeded: `npm run build` produced dist/index.html and assets (vite build output reported built in 275ms).
- Preview step failed in this environment: `npm run preview` returned a spawnSync ETIMEDOUT (likely an environment limitation rather than a code error).
- Playwright e2e configuration and a test exist (playwright.config.ts and tests/e2e/app.spec.ts). Those e2e tests were not executed here; vitest is configured to exclude e2e tests.
- package.json exposes appropriate scripts (dev, build, preview, test, lint, etc.) and enforces Node >= 22.17.0.
- Git history shows recent commits related to tests and e2e orchestration, indicating attention to testing and CI setup.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the dev server locally (npm run dev) and open the app to manually confirm the rendered page and styles in a browser.
- Fix or investigate the preview timeout in this environment (spawnSync ETIMEDOUT). Try `npm run preview` again locally or run `vite preview` directly; ensure the preview server can start so e2e tests can run against it.
- Execute Playwright e2e tests by starting the preview/dev server and running Playwright to validate end-to-end behavior across browsers (add an npm script to orchestrate start+e2e if helpful).
- Add an automated CI step that starts the preview server and runs Playwright e2e tests to ensure full-stack verification on each change.
- Expand tests to cover more real-world interactions (accessibility checks, keyboard navigation, and more DOM assertions) to increase confidence in functionality.
- Consider adding a small smoke-test or health-check script that can be run after build/preview to confirm the app serves the expected HTML (title, #app present) before e2e runs.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (78% ± 13% COMPLETE)
- Overall the project shows good code-quality foundations: a comprehensive ESLint flat config, TypeScript-aware linting, Prettier, stylelint config, and a test suite that passes. Automated quality scripts are present in package.json. However there are a small number of lint warnings and Prettier formatting issues reported locally (causing lint:check / format:check to fail), and some housekeeping (unused variable, files needing formatting) should be resolved for a clean, enforceable baseline.
- Linting infrastructure: eslint.config.ts present and delegates to a robust config in config/eslint (base.ts, dx.ts, performance.ts). The project uses @typescript-eslint parser and configures project-aware parserOptions.
- Formatting: prettier.config.ts exists and is configured (printWidth, singleQuote, trailingComma, overrides). package.json includes format / format:check scripts.
- Style linting: stylelint.config.ts present and configured to extend standard configs and css-modules; package.json contains lint:css scripts.
- Tests: vitest tests run successfully locally: 4 test files, 14 tests passed (npm test output).
- npm run lint reported an ESLint warning: 1 problem (0 errors, 1 warning) in .github/scripts/generate-e2e-stability-summary.js: 'err' is defined but never used.
- npm run lint:check failed because ESLint warnings exceed the maximum (lint:check uses --max-warnings 0). This demonstrates lint enforcement is strict but there are outstanding warnings.
- npm run format:check (Prettier) reported style issues in 5 files; Prettier suggests running --write to fix. Files reported: .github/scripts/generate-e2e-stability-summary.js, config/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts, e2e-stability.json, playwright-results.json, tests/e2e/app.spec.ts.
- Project scripts include verify that chains audit fix, lint:fix, lint:check, format:check, build, test:ci — good automation is present to enforce quality if run.
- Code organization: source is small and well-structured (src/app.ts, src/main.ts, css). Tests are colocated under tests/ and there are config directories. Naming is consistent and TypeScript types are used in source code.
- Error handling example: src/app.ts checks for the existence of #app and logs an error if absent — simple and appropriate for this small app.
- No obvious code duplication found in the small codebase inspected; code is concise and idiomatic.

**Next Steps:**
- Run automatic fixes and formatters: npm run lint:fix && npm run format (or npm run format:check after writing). This will resolve many of the low-effort issues reported.
- Fix remaining ESLint warnings by addressing the root causes (e.g., remove or underscore unused variable 'err' in .github/scripts/generate-e2e-stability-summary.js) and re-run npm run lint:check until it passes.
- Add a CI job (or ensure existing CI) enforces lint:check and format:check on pull requests so new code cannot be merged with warnings/format issues.
- Run the type-check script (npm run type-check) in CI to ensure type errors are prevented from entering the main branch; consider including it in the verify pipeline.
- Consider adding an npm script or CI step to auto-fix or fail on formatting/lint issues before merges (pre-commit/pre-push hooks via Husky are present in repo — ensure they run and block commits that violate rules).
- Consider adding a static analysis/duplication tool or code coverage gates if you plan to scale the codebase to catch duplication and complexity regressions earlier.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (75% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Good unit-test coverage and passing test suite (Vitest) with 100% coverage reported for the exercised files. Project also includes Playwright E2E tests, but E2E is not wired into the NPM scripts and is excluded from Vitest runs. Overall testing is solid for the small surface covered, but test surface is limited and E2E integration/automation is incomplete.
- Vitest is configured and used as the test runner (package.json scripts: test, test:ci, test:coverage; vitest.config.ts present).
- Found unit tests in tests/*.test.ts (tests/main.test.ts, health-check-utils.test.ts, prepare-libraries.test.ts, coverage-increase.test.ts).
- Ran the test suite locally: npx vitest run --coverage completed successfully — 4 test files, 14 tests passed, 0 failures.
- Coverage output from Vitest (v8 provider) reported 100% statements/branches/functions/lines for the files exercised (app.ts, main.ts and overall reported 'All files 100').
- Playwright end-to-end tests exist under tests/e2e (tests/e2e/app.spec.ts) and playwright.config.ts is present, indicating E2E test capability.
- Vitest configuration explicitly excludes tests/e2e from unit test runs: vitest.config.ts test.exclude includes 'tests/e2e/**'.
- package.json does not contain NPM scripts to run Playwright E2E (no 'e2e' or 'e2e:ci' script found) — CI workflow references npm run e2e:ci but the script is missing in package.json.
- CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) installs browsers, starts a preview server, and attempts to run E2E (npm run e2e:ci || true) — the workflow expects E2E scripts but they are not defined, meaning E2E is not guaranteed to run in CI as-is.
- Many project files and config are excluded from coverage and test runs by config (vitest exclusions), so reported 100% coverage likely reflects a small, tested surface rather than broad project-wide coverage.

**Next Steps:**
- Add explicit NPM scripts to run Playwright E2E (e.g. 'e2e', 'e2e:ci') and document how to run them locally (start preview server + npx playwright test).
- Integrate E2E runs into CI properly (ensure npm run e2e:ci exists and returns non-zero on failures so CI can fail appropriately; avoid relying on '|| true').
- Expand unit and integration test coverage beyond app.ts/main.ts — add tests for other modules and critical logic to get broader, meaningful coverage (the current 100% covers a very small surface).
- Persist coverage artifacts to coverage/ and add coverage thresholds to test:ci to prevent regressions (e.g. fail when overall coverage drops below acceptable threshold).
- Add documentation for running tests locally (unit, coverage, and E2E), and add a test/CI troubleshooting section describing requirements (Node version, installing Playwright browsers, starting preview server).

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (85% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The project executes well for its intended purpose (static pre-launch website). I was able to install dependencies, produce a production build, and run the test suite with all tests passing. The preview/dev server was flaky in this environment (timed out / connection refused), but the built artifacts (dist) are valid and the app initialization contains basic runtime error handling.
- Dependencies installed successfully with `npm ci` (prepare script ran and linked package READMEs; 666 packages added).
- `npm run build` completed successfully (vite built dist with assets).
- Built output exists and is valid: dist/index.html contains the expected index with references to /assets/main-*.js and /assets/main-*.css.
- Test suite (Vitest) ran successfully: 4 test files, 14 tests — all passed.
- Source code runtime behavior is minimal and testable: src/app.ts checks for #app and logs an error if missing (basic runtime error handling).
- Runtime dependencies in package.json (@microsoft/clarity, gsap, three) are declared and were installed.
- Health-check utilities (scripts/health-check-utils.js) include defensive parsing and null handling; tests cover these utilities.
- Attempt to start a preview/dev server had issues in this environment: starting preview via the tool at one point produced background vite preview processes that initially refused connections (net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED). Subsequent attempts to run `npm run preview` / `npm run dev` hit spawnSync ETIMEDOUT in this execution environment. This appears to be an environment limitation rather than a build/test failure: the production build is present and valid.
- No runtime API or server-side code exists (static site), so runtime dependency surface is small; basic smoke checks were possible by inspecting built files.

**Next Steps:**
- Verify local preview: run `npm run preview` (or `npm run dev`) locally and confirm the server serves the built assets at the expected port (default 5173). Investigate environment-specific timeouts if preview repeatedly fails in CI or automation.
- Add an explicit start/serve script for the dist folder (e.g., using a small static server like 'serve' or 'http-server') so previewing production artifacts is consistent across environments and CI.
- Add a small end-to-end smoke test in CI that requests the built index.html (or uses headless browser) to catch preview/start regressions early. Ensure the CI environment allows starting background servers.
- Expand runtime checks/logging if you plan to add dynamic behavior (for now the app is static and minimal handling is present). Consider adding error boundaries or graceful fallbacks if more complex runtime features are added.
- If preview server instability persists in automation, capture and inspect server logs and the exact error (spawnSync ETIMEDOUT) to determine whether resource limits or platform constraints are causing the failure.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (75% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is generally solid for a small static site: a clear README with setup and run instructions, a Developer Setup guide, a security file, many Architectural Decision Records and per-library notes. Missing pieces are an explicit changelog/release notes, API documentation (if applicable), more inline docstrings/JSDoc in source code, and one empty CI-AUDIT.md file. Overall this is a good developer-facing documentation baseline with a few practical gaps to address.
- README.md present and actionable — contains prerequisites, quick start (npm ci), run/build/preview/test/lint scripts and troubleshooting notes. (README.md)
- Developer guide exists and is thorough: docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md gives reproducible install and verification steps matching package.json scripts. (docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md)
- Architectural documentation exists as ADRs: docs/decisions contains many accepted decision records (0000…0024). (docs/decisions/*.md)
- Per-library notes are provided under docs/libraries with many files documenting third-party dependencies and rationale. (docs/libraries/*.md)
- Security guidance and scan artifacts are documented: SECURITY.md references audit artifacts and scheduled scans. (SECURITY.md)
- Health/audit artifacts present: audit-summary.md and ci-audit-summary.md exist; repo contains audit JSON artifacts and scripts referenced in package.json. (audit-summary.md, ci-audit-summary.md, audit.json mentioned in scripts)
- Tests run successfully on the local environment and the README/docs map to available npm scripts — I executed npm test and all tests passed. (tests run: 4 files, 14 tests passed)
- Source code contains minimal inline comments but lacks JSDoc-style docstrings for exported functions (e.g., src/app.ts has a short comment but no JSDoc). (src/app.ts, src/main.ts)
- No explicit changelog or release notes were found (no CHANGELOG.md or RELEASE_NOTES.md), which makes tracking user-visible changes/releases harder.
- No API documentation file found (no API.md or equivalent). For a small static site this may be acceptable, but if any public programmatic surface exists it is undocumented.
- docs/CI-AUDIT.md is present but empty — indicates an incomplete doc or placeholder. (docs/CI-AUDIT.md)

**Next Steps:**
- Add a changelog or release notes (CHANGELOG.md) and a short release process note in docs so changes and releases are discoverable.
- If the project exposes any programmatic API or config surface, add API documentation (API.md or docs/api/*). If there is no API, add a short note in README clarifying this to set expectations.
- Improve inline documentation: add JSDoc comments for exported functions and key modules (e.g., src/app.ts init function) to aid reader understanding and IDE/typedoc tooling.
- Populate docs/CI-AUDIT.md or remove it if not needed — ensure CI-related docs referenced in README/docs are not empty placeholders.
- Add a small docs upkeep checklist in DEVELOPER-SETUP.md or README to remind maintainers to update docs/CHANGELOG and API docs when making breaking or public-facing changes.
- Consider adding a short docs/CONTRIBUTING.md describing documentation standards (where to add ADRs, when to update CHANGELOG, required docstrings) and linking to linting rules (markdownlint) to keep docs consistent.
- If releases are published, add a short release script or workflow notes (link the GitHub Actions workflow) and an example of how versioning/changelog entries should be authored.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (0% ± 20% COMPLETE)
- Assessment failed due to error: Assessment was cancelled
- Error occurred during DEPENDENCIES assessment: Assessment was cancelled

**Next Steps:**
- Check assessment system configuration
- Verify project accessibility

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (88% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository has strong, automated security tooling and CI checks (npm audit, CodeQL, gitleaks secret scan, SBOM attempt, Dependabot). Current artifacts show no vulnerabilities and no secrets detected in committed files. Remaining gaps are operational/hardening items (CSP/secure headers, SRI, explicit least-privilege workflow permissions) and the presence of a local .env file (gitignored) which requires care to avoid accidental commits.
- Automated security workflows present in .github/workflows: security-audit.yml (npm audit + SBOM), code-scanning.yml (CodeQL), secret-scan.yml (gitleaks).
- npm audit artifact (audit.json) shows zero vulnerabilities (metadata.vulnerabilities: all 0). audit-summary.md confirms no high/critical findings.
- Secret-scan artifacts (repo-secrets-scan.json / repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt) appear present but empty — no secrets found in the repository snapshot provided.
- parse-audit.js script used in CI to parse npm audit and fail CI if high/critical vulnerabilities are found (.github/scripts/parse-audit.js).
- Dependabot configured (.github/dependabot.yml) to update npm dependencies weekly.
- CI (ci.yml) uses a number of verification steps (type-check, lint, build, tests, Playwright E2E) and uploads artifacts for triage — good CI hygiene.
- A local .env file exists in the working tree (check_file_exists returned true) but is excluded by .gitignore/.voderignore; presence of an ignored .env means developers must be careful not to accidentally commit secrets.
- index.html and app code: no Content-Security-Policy (CSP) meta tag present and app uses innerHTML to inject static content (currently safe since content is hard-coded, but innerHTML could be a future XSS vector if user content is introduced).
- No Content-Security-Policy or HTTP security header configuration in repo (no server config provided) — production hosting may need explicit security header configuration.
- SBOM generation is attempted in the security-audit workflow (npx @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-bom) but the step is non-fatal (|| true), so SBOM may not always be produced; artifacts are uploaded if present.
- Workflows use commonly-updated action versions (actions/checkout@v4, actions/upload-artifact@v4 etc.). Some workflow jobs run with fairly broad permissions (CI workflows use default runner permissions) — least-privilege could be tightened further.

**Next Steps:**
- Add a baseline Content-Security-Policy (CSP) for the site (meta tag or host headers) to reduce XSS risk and document it in repo (e.g., SECURITY.md or docs).
- Ensure production hosting enforces HTTPS and sets security headers (Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy).
- Avoid future use of innerHTML for dynamic content; prefer safe DOM APIs or templating that auto-escapes. If innerHTML must be used, assert inputs are sanitized and add CSP.
- Harden GitHub Actions permissions and review workflow scope: use least-privilege permissions where possible and restrict token access for scheduled jobs that don't need full repo write access.
- Make SBOM generation a reliable artifact (fail the job or surface a specific warning) or document why it is optional. Keep SBOMs in a known artifact location for audits.
- Add SRI (Subresource Integrity) for any future external scripts/assets, and review third-party dependencies for privacy/telemetry concerns (e.g., analytics libraries like @microsoft/clarity).
- Add repository pre-commit hooks (or CI checks) to prevent accidental commits of .env and other secret files; consider a documented secrets handling policy and rotate any credentials if they were ever committed.
- Consider enabling auto security updates (Dependabot automerges/PR policies) and ensure maintainers triage weekly Dependabot PRs; also enable GitHub Advanced Security features if available (Secret scanning Alerts, Dependabot security updates).
- Document the security runbook in SECURITY.md for triaging audit artifacts (you have a good start) and ensure maintainers know how to access CI artifacts (audit.json, repo-secrets-scan) to respond to findings promptly.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Version control is well-established and actively maintained: a long, clear commit history with mostly conventional commit messages, multiple branches and tags, CI workflows, a .gitignore, and pre-commit hooks are present. Minor issues: working directory is not clean (two modified tracked files in .voder/), some repository metadata (LICENSE) is missing, and hooks can be skipped via SKIP_HOOKS — these lower the score slightly.
- Git history: 268 commits (git rev-list --count HEAD). Recent commits present up to 2025-09-11; history shows frequent activity.
- Commit messages: Majority follow a conventional style (examples: "chore(tests): ...", "ci(e2e): ...", "feat: ...", "fix: ..."). Recent HEAD commit: 5aa9e37 (voder-bot) "chore(tests): ensure vitest excludes e2e tests and add e2e orchestration script".
- Authors: Primary contributor Tom Howard (190 commits) plus automated/bot commits (voder-bot ~78 commits), showing clear human + automation activity (git shortlog).
- Branches: Multiple branches exist including main and active branch 'fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage' which is currently checked out and tracking remotes/origin/fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage (git branch -a output).
- Working directory: Not clean — git status shows two modified tracked files: .voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md (git status --porcelain -b).
- .voder files: The .voder directory files are visible to git (modified) but were inaccessible to the read-file tool due to project ignore patterns (.voderignore), which may cause tooling blind spots for those files.
- Ignored files: A comprehensive .gitignore exists and includes node_modules/, dist/, env files, coverage/, logs, and other transient files — appropriate for the project type.
- Pre-commit hooks: .husky/pre-commit exists and runs format:check, lint:check and type-check, which is good; however it allows skipping hooks when SKIP_HOOKS is set (explicitly supported in the script).
- CI and workflows: .github/workflows contains CI and security workflows (ci.yml, code-scanning.yml, secret-scan.yml, security-audit.yml, e2e-stability.yml), indicating CI integration.
- Tags: Two tags present: v1.0.0-complete and v1.0.1 (git tag -l).
- Repository config: core.bare is false (normal), and HEAD commit metadata shows automated actor for recent changes.
- Important tracked files: package.json, README.md, CI workflows, and tooling configs are present and tracked.
- Missing/odd items: No LICENSE file found (package.json license set to "UNLICENSED"), which may be intentional but is notable for open-source clarity.

**Next Steps:**
- Commit or stash the modified tracked .voder files (git add && git commit or git stash) or intentionally untrack them if they should not be versioned — ensure working directory is clean before releases/CI runs that assume a clean tree.
- Review whether files under .voder should be tracked at all; if they should be ignored, remove them from the index (git rm --cached) and add to .gitignore/.voderignore as appropriate; if they must be tracked, ensure developer tooling can read them (adjust .voderignore usage in local tools).
- Consider adding a LICENSE file (if applicable) or explicitly documenting licensing intentions in the repo to avoid ambiguity.
- Enforce commit policies (e.g., branch protection rules, required status checks) in remote repository settings to prevent accidental bypassing of hooks and to make SKIP_HOOKS harder to misuse.
- Consider enabling signed commits or adding verification on CI for commit authorship if provenance is required.
- Add an explicit CONTRIBUTING.md and branch protection / PR templates if not already present to make branching and commit expectations clearer to contributors.
