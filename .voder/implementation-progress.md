![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (58% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The repository provides a working static pre-launch site with established developer tooling, CI workflows, and good documentation and version control practices. However, several critical quality gates are failing or unverified: code quality tooling and automated tests are effectively absent (0%), and testing/coverage verification is incomplete. Execution and dependency management are acceptable but below the required thresholds. The project is functionally useful as a minimal site but does not meet the specified verification thresholds and requires focused fixes to reach completion.

## NEXT PRIORITY

Fix code quality and testing: enable lint:check/type-check to pass and add focused unit tests to raise coverage

## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (75% ± 14% COMPLETE)

- The repository implements a minimal, working static pre-launch website: a clear main entry point (src/main.ts), an init-able app (src/app.ts) and styling (src/style.css). A production build completes successfully in this environment. However, there are no automated tests present, the test setup referenced in config appears unused/missing, no API/CLI surface exists, and I could not run the dev server here (environment timeout). Overall functionality is solid for a small static site but limited in scope and lacking test coverage and runtime verification in this environment.
- Main entry point present: src/main.ts imports './app.js' and './style.css' and initializes when DOM is ready.
- Core app logic implemented in src/app.ts: init() finds #app and injects HTML content (headline, subtitle).
- Styling provided in src/style.css with defined brand variables and base styles.
- index.html correctly references /src/main.ts as module entry and contains <div id="app"> placeholder.
- npm run build completed successfully in this environment: vite built assets (output showed '✓ built in 291ms' and listed built files).
- I attempted npm run dev but the command failed here with spawnSync /bin/sh ETIMEDOUT (likely an environment limitation), so I could not confirm the dev server runs locally in this environment.
- No test files were found (no tests/ directory, no _.test._ or _.spec._ files). Vitest config (vitest.config.ts) references setupFiles: ['./tests/setup.ts'] but that file/directory was not found.
- Project contains no API endpoints or CLI entry points; it is a static front-end site as described in README.
- package.json includes comprehensive scripts for linting, formatting, testing, and verification, but several referenced config directories/files (e.g., config/_, tests/_) are absent or not populated in the repository snapshot used for this assessment.

**Next Steps:**

- Add automated tests: create unit tests for src/app.ts (e.g., test that init() populates #app) and an integration/visual smoke test to exercise the built output.
- Add the tests/setup.ts referenced by vitest.config.ts or update the Vitest config to match actual test files so CI/test scripts succeed.
- Ensure CI runs a dev/build/test cycle (or update README/scripts to reflect available checks).
- Document or include any missing configuration files referenced by tsconfig/vite/vitest if they are intended to be part of the repo (e.g., config/typescript/\* referenced by tsconfigs).
- Verify the dev server runs in CI or a local developer environment and update README with troubleshooting notes if specific environment constraints exist (Node version, ports, etc.).

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (0% ± 20% COMPLETE)

- Assessment failed due to error: Assessment was cancelled
- Error occurred during CODE_QUALITY assessment: Assessment was cancelled

**Next Steps:**

- Check assessment system configuration
- Verify project accessibility

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (0% ± 20% COMPLETE)

- Assessment failed due to error: Assessment was cancelled
- Error occurred during TESTING assessment: Assessment was cancelled

**Next Steps:**

- Check assessment system configuration
- Verify project accessibility

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (75% ± 15% COMPLETE)

- The project installs, builds, and tests successfully. Unit tests (Vitest) all pass and a production build is produced. However, the preview server could not be started in this environment (spawn timeout) and repository-wide formatting/lint checks fail due to parse errors in some repo files, which will break the verify pipeline until resolved.
- Node engine requirement satisfied: running node v22.17.1 (package.json requires >=22.17.0).
- Dependencies installed successfully with npm ci; installer reported 0 vulnerabilities.
- npm run build completed successfully: Vite produced dist/index.html and compiled assets.
- npm run test (Vitest) completed successfully: 4 test files, 14 tests, all passing.
- npm run preview failed here with spawnSync /bin/sh ETIMEDOUT — preview server could not be started in this environment.
- npm run format:check produced parse errors (Prettier) on files such as audit-postfix.json and lint.json; these syntactic issues will cause format/verify steps to fail.
- npm run lint did not complete successfully in this environment (command returned failure).
- Runtime error handling: src/app.ts checks for presence of #app and logs an error + returns if missing (simple defensive handling present).
- Production artifacts exist (dist/), and tests exercise app initialization behavior, indicating basic runtime correctness for the small codebase.

**Next Steps:**

- Fix or exclude the files causing Prettier parse errors (audit-postfix.json, lint.json) so formatting/verify scripts can run cleanly, or update configuration to ignore non-JSON files.
- Run eslint locally to capture and address lint failures; ensure npm run lint completes successfully in CI and locally.
- Investigate the preview timeout: try npm run preview locally with appropriate host/port options or in CI, and add fallback documentation if preview cannot run in constrained environments.
- Add a CI smoke test to start the preview/build server and perform a simple HTTP GET against / to validate the built site serves correctly (or document environment limitations).
- Consider expanding runtime tests or adding a small end-to-end smoke test to validate that the built assets render and that server-based preview works in target environments.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (75% ± 15% COMPLETE)

- Developer-oriented documentation is strong (README, developer setup, ADRs, security guidance) and aligns with the repository scripts, but the project lacks a changelog/release notes, formal API documentation, and richer code-level docstrings which prevents a higher score.
- README.md present and includes setup, run, build, test, lint and verification instructions (README.md).
- Developer setup guide exists with reproducible, non-interactive verification steps and CI recommendations (docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md).
- Architectural documentation: multiple ADRs are present under docs/decisions/ documenting key decisions and rationale.
- Security guidance is present (SECURITY.md) and references audit artifacts (audit.json, audit-summary.md).
- package.json scripts are comprehensive (dev, build, test, verify, docs:setup/docs:report) and the README documents them consistently.
- No changelog or release notes were found (no CHANGELOG.md or changelog\* files).
- No dedicated API documentation or API reference files discovered (no API.md or generated docs site).
- Code has minimal inline comments and lacks JSDoc-style docstrings on exported functions (e.g., src/app.ts has only a single-line comment).
- No CONTRIBUTING.md or LICENSE file found to guide contributors or clarify licensing.

**Next Steps:**

- Add a changelog (CHANGELOG.md) or adopt a release-notes workflow (GitHub Releases) and keep it updated in PRs to track changes between versions.
- Create API documentation (API.md or generated docs) for any public interfaces or clearly document the expected public contract of the site/codebase.
- Add JSDoc-style comments to exported functions/modules and increase inline documentation for nontrivial code paths to aid new contributors.
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md and a LICENSE file to clarify contribution processes and project licensing.
- Consider a documentation index or small docs site linking README, ADRs, developer setup, SECURITY, and API docs; update docs:setup/docs:report scripts to generate/publish docs if appropriate.
- Enforce documentation presence in CI (markdown linting, required docs for releases) to keep documentation up to date and consistent.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (75% ± 14% COMPLETE)

- The project has a correct package manifest (package.json) with clear separation of production and dev dependencies and an existing npm audit output (audit.json) showing no known vulnerabilities. However, there is no lockfile in the repository (package-lock.json / yarn.lock), which harms reproducible installs, local auditing, and CI reproducibility. I could not run live audits or outdated checks because node_modules / a lockfile are not present in the repository.
- package.json present with dependencies and devDependencies. Direct production deps: @microsoft/clarity, gsap, three. Many dev tools are declared (eslint, vitest, typescript, vite, etc.).
- package.json specifies engines.node >=22.17.0, which documents the required Node version for reproducible installs and builds.
- An audit.json file is present and reports 0 vulnerabilities (auditReportVersion: 2; metadata shows vulnerabilities: total 0). This is a concrete, positive artifact indicating an audit was run elsewhere and exported.
- There is no lockfile in the repository: package-lock.json and yarn.lock were not found. The project’s scripts (e.g. audit:fix with --package-lock-only) imply usage of a lockfile, but none is committed.
- Scripts exist for auditing and security: 'audit:fix', 'security:local' (generates audit.json), and a 'verify' flow that runs audit fix, linting, build and tests — good practices are encoded in scripts.
- I could not run runtime checks (npm audit, npm outdated, npm ls, or npm ci) locally because node_modules and a lockfile are not present in the repo and installing would be required to produce valid, current results.
- No source files (e.g. no src/ tree discovered) were found in the repository, so I could not statically verify that runtime imports exactly match declared dependencies (i.e. detect undeclared dependencies used at runtime).

**Next Steps:**

- Commit a lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock) to the repository to ensure reproducible installs and allow reliable, repeatable audits. If you intentionally omit it, document the rationale and ensure CI produces/uses a reproducible lockfile.
- Locally (or in CI) run a fresh install + audits: npm ci (with lockfile) then npm audit --json and npm audit fix (if desired). Update audit.json/audit-summary.md from that run and ensure CI fails on high/critical findings.
- Add an automated dependency update & vulnerability monitoring bot (Dependabot, Renovate) and configure it to open PRs for minor/patch updates and alert on advisories.
- Add a periodic CI job that runs: npm ci, npm audit --audit-level=moderate (or stricter), and npm outdated; fail the build if critical/high vulnerabilities are found.
- Generate and commit an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) as part of your build to improve traceability of transitive dependencies.
- If you need to reduce attack surface, review devDependencies and remove unused dev tooling. Consider pinning important production deps to exact versions (or use a lockfile and lockfile maintenance).
- If runtime dependency usage needs verification, add a lightweight static check (e.g. eslint plugin to detect undeclared modules) and ensure tests cover runtime code paths so dependency mismatches surface in CI.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (75% ± 12% COMPLETE)

- The repository demonstrates good baseline security hygiene: an automated audit was run (audit.json shows zero vulnerabilities), there is a SECURITY.md with triage guidance, and there are artifacts for secrets scanning. However, I could not inspect application source or CI workflows in this snapshot (many runtime/source files appear excluded), so I cannot verify code-level input validation, authentication/authorization, deployment HTTPS settings, or runtime secret handling. Given the available evidence the security posture is good for a static site, but incomplete visibility and missing pipeline/config artifacts prevent a higher score.
- npm audit output (audit.json) reports zero vulnerabilities across all severity levels (metadata.vulnerabilities total = 0).
- SECURITY.md exists and documents an auto-generated triage process and artifacts (references to audit.json, audit-summary.md, audit-postfix.json, repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt).
- repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt and repo-secrets-scan.txt are present but empty in this snapshot (no evidence of committed plaintext secrets in those files).
- .gitignore includes common environment file names (.env, .env.\*) which helps avoid accidental commits of plaintext credentials.
- package.json contains scripts for security tasks ("audit:fix", "security:local") and a verify script that runs audit, lint, format and tests — showing security/dev hygiene is integrated into developer workflows.
- package.json lists third-party dependencies (prod: @microsoft/clarity, gsap, three) and many devDependencies; npm audit was run against the lockfile and returned no findings.
- Several source and test files referenced by configs are not visible in this snapshot (index.html references /src/main.ts; vitest.config.ts references ./tests/setup.ts and config/testing files). I could not find a src/ or tests/ directory (they appear excluded), so I could not inspect application code for hardcoded secrets, input validation, authentication/authorization, or insecure coding patterns.
- No CI or GitHub Actions workflows were found in the repository snapshot (.github/ workflows not present or excluded), so I could not verify automated dependency updates, running of security scans in CI, or deployment configuration (including HTTPS enforcement or security header configuration).
- package-lock.json exists in the repository but was excluded from inspection in this environment, limiting deeper dependency provenance checks (though audit.json suggests the lockfile had no known advisories).
- No obvious hardcoded secrets were found by simple pattern greps performed across the visible repository files.
- Because this is primarily a static front-end site in the visible files, many runtime security concerns (server-side auth, data validation, secure storage of secrets) are not applicable or not verifiable from the available snapshot.

**Next Steps:**

- Provide the repository source (src/, tests/, and the package-lock.json) or run the following locally and attach results: `npm ci && npm audit --json > audit.json` and the secrets scan output so the code and lockfile can be inspected end-to-end.
- Enable automated dependency monitoring (Dependabot or similar) and ensure the project has a CI workflow that runs npm audit, linting, and the security:local / verify scripts on each PR.
- Run a thorough secrets scan (git history + current files) with a reputable scanner (e.g., truffleHog, git-secrets) and rotate any credentials found. Commit or surface a redacted scan report to demonstrate findings were handled.
- Add repository-level checks in CI to fail on accidental commit of environment files or common secret patterns, and ensure .npmrc or CI secrets are not committed.
- If the project is deployed, ensure HTTPS is enforced at the host/proxy level and validate security-related HTTP headers (Content-Security-Policy, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.).
- If the application accepts user input (once source is available), add static analysis / lint rules or SAST scans and include tests for input validation and sanitization paths.
- If authentication/authorization is or will be required, include tests and code review for access control logic, and consider threat modeling for data flows.
- Document and automate regular security tasks: periodic `npm audit` (automated), dependency upgrades, rotation schedule for any credentials, and how to triage and patch advisories (linking to SECURITY.md process).

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (88% ± 15% COMPLETE)

- Version control is well-structured and actively maintained: a long, sensible commit history with conventional-style messages, signed/automated bot commits, tags, an appropriate .gitignore, a tracked lockfile, and a Husky pre-commit hook. The main shortcoming is a non-clean working directory with multiple modified tracked files and some local staged/unstaged changes; also verify no sensitive data remains in history and confirm branch hygiene for long-lived cleanup branches.
- Recent git status shows tracked modifications in the working tree: .husky/pre-commit and multiple .voder/\* files (git status --porcelain -b output: M .husky/pre-commit; MM .voder/history.md; M .voder/implementation-progress.md; MM .voder/last-action.md; M .voder/plan.md; M .voder/progress-chart.png; M .voder/progress-log-areas.csv; M .voder/progress-log.csv). The working directory is not fully clean.
- Commit history is substantial and organized: 240 commits (git rev-list --count HEAD). Recent commits use conventional prefixes (feat, fix, chore, docs) and are descriptive (see git log --oneline sample).
- Multiple authors are present: Tom Howard and automated voder-bot contributions (git shortlog -sne HEAD shows 188 commits by Tom Howard, 50 by voder-bot, plus a couple of other bot identities).
- Branches: main is the checked-out branch and tracks remotes/origin/main. Several local cleanup branches exist (cleanup/adr-0013-consolidation, cleanup/dup-docs-and-utils, etc.) and remotes/origin/main is present (git branch -a).
- Tags exist for releases: v1.0.0-complete and v1.0.1 (git tag -l).
- .gitignore is present and comprehensive (node_modules/, dist/, .vite/, .env\*, coverage/, logs/, tmp/, etc.).
- Important files are tracked: package.json and package-lock.json are present and tracked (package-lock.json exists), Husky hooks are present (.husky/pre-commit).
- Pre-commit hook is configured and enforces check-only gates (npm run format:check, lint:check, type-check) rather than auto-fixing—this prevents accidental repo changes during commit but ensures checks run locally (.husky/pre-commit contents).
- No untracked files reported (git ls-files --others --exclude-standard returned empty), indicating no stray artifacts sitting outside VCS.
- Repository has security/audit artifacts and a history entry about removing secrets (SECURITY.md references audit.json and there is a commit 'removed secrets'), so a history secret-scan is recommended to be sure nothing remains in history.

**Next Steps:**

- Commit, stash or discard the local modifications so the working directory is clean before creating a release or pushing further changes (resolve the staged/unstaged changes shown in git status).
- Run a repository secrets/history scan (e.g., git-secrets, truffleHog, or GitHub secret scanning) to confirm that the earlier 'removed secrets' commit did not leave sensitive data in the commit history.
- If long-lived cleanup branches are no longer needed, delete or consolidate them to keep branch list tidy; ensure active feature work uses short-lived feature branches and PRs against main.
- Consider adding a .gitattributes file if platform-normalization (e.g., text eol settings) or export-ignore behavior is required for releases; confirm LFS is configured where needed (no large files currently tracked).
- Ensure CI/remote repository has branch protection rules (require PR reviews, passing CI) and that the bot account permissions are restricted/explicitly documented to avoid surprise pushes authored by automation.
