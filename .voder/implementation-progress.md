Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 62.8

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (82.5% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The repository is in a strong state: unit tests, linting, formatting, ADRs, and developer onboarding docs are present and the test suite for core UI passes. The main blocker for completeness is reliable execution of end-to-end verification (Playwright + preview server) and a small set of security/hardening items. Several CI orchestration scripts and verification helpers are in place, but execution/preview stability and a few security/coverage edge cases must be resolved before declaring the project complete against the stated thresholds.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Fix the preview+E2E execution pipeline so Playwright tests run reliably and produce artifacts: ensure preview server start/health logic is deterministic in CI, capture preview logs on failure, and confirm e2e-stability.json is populated by successful runs.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The project provides a working static pre-launch website: clear main entry points, an init routine that renders the UI, styling, a successful build, and a passing unit test suite. End-to-end/preview verification could not be completed here because Playwright runs and the Vite preview server were not reachable in this environment.
- Main entry points present: src/main.ts, src/app.ts (exported init()), and index.html referencing /src/main.ts.
- UI implementation: init() populates #app with expected content (heading 'Voder' and subtitle).
- Styling: src/style.css provides layout and theme variables used by the site.
- Unit tests: Vitest suite executed successfully here (4 test files, 14 tests passed).
- Build: npm run build completed successfully (tsc + vite) and produced dist/ with index.html and bundled assets.
- E2E tests: tests/e2e/app.spec.ts exists and Playwright can list the test, but attempts to run Playwright tests in this environment failed (npx playwright test returned errors).
- Preview server: npm run preview was attempted via background start; HTTP requests to http://localhost:5173/ failed (connection refused), so the built site could not be validated over HTTP.
- Tooling and scripts: project includes health-check, linting, formatting, and test scripts; repo is well-instrumented for developer workflows.

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate why vite preview did not serve or bind to the expected port in this environment: reproduce locally, capture server stdout/stderr, and confirm port binding.
- Re-run Playwright E2E tests against a confirmed running preview or dev server and capture Playwright logs to identify failures.
- Add CI job that builds the site, starts a server (vite preview or a lightweight static server) and runs Playwright tests to validate end-to-end behavior in CI.
- If server start fails in CI, consider using an explicit static server (http-server/serve) for the built dist/ directory or configure Playwright to serve dist/ during tests.
- Add clearer logging around preview startup and document any environment requirements (ports, Node version, Playwright browsers) in README to ease debugging.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (84% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- Overall code quality is high for the application source: strong TypeScript typing, comprehensive ESLint/Prettier/stylelint tooling, passing tests, and a clean build. The primary gap is many Markdown/documentation lint violations (lint:md) which cause the repository-level lint verification to fail. The runtime source is small and well-structured with appropriate basic error handling and no obvious duplication.
- ESLint: A deliberate flat ESLint config is present (eslint.config.ts + config/eslint/*). The repo exposes lint scripts (lint, lint:fix, lint:check). Running eslint produced no visible issues for source files.
- Prettier: prettier.config.ts present and 'npm run format:check' reports 'All matched files use Prettier code style!'.
- Stylelint / HTMLHint: Configuration files exist (stylelint.config.ts, htmlhint.config.js) and npm run lint:css / npm run lint:html did not report errors during inspection.
- Type checking: 'npm run type-check' (tsc --noEmit) completed without errors.
- Tests: 'npm test' (Vitest) ran successfully — 4 test files, 14 tests, all passed. Coverage-related tests are present and executed by the test scripts.
- Build: 'npm run build' completed successfully (Vite build produced dist/ artifacts).
- Code organization: Source is small and well-organized (src/app.ts, src/main.ts, style.css). Config and tooling are centralized under config/ and scripts/, and tests live in tests/ with a test setup file.
- Error handling: app.ts checks for the #app element and logs an error then returns (pragmatic and appropriate for a tiny static site). main.ts uses DOMContentLoaded logic and logs a startup warning—no uncaught exceptions visible.
- Naming conventions: Consistent simple naming (init, app, main), TypeScript types used in DOM selections (e.g., querySelector<HTMLDivElement>).
- Duplication: With the small codebase no observable code duplication was found.
- Repository-level lint/verification: 'npm run lint:md' failed with many markdownlint errors across docs/libraries/*.md and README.md (multiple rule violations: MD041, MD010, MD009, MD031, MD022, MD012, etc.). This is the main blocker for the repo 'verify' script passing cleanly.

**Next Steps:**
- Run 'npm run lint:md:fix' and manually review remaining Markdown issues; prioritize fixing first-line heading, hard tabs, trailing spaces, fenced block spacing and heading spacing errors across docs/ to make lint:md pass.
- Add or verify CI step ensures 'npm run verify' (or at least lint:check + format:check + test + build) runs and fails fast on markdown linting errors so doc regressions are caught earlier.
- Consider configuring markdownlint rules or exception patterns if some third-party docs must remain verbatim, or move such files out of linted docs/ paths to avoid noise.
- Add a developer pre-commit / pre-push hook to run a small subset of linters (eslint --max-warnings 0, prettier --check) to prevent regressions; there is a .husky directory present — ensure hooks are wired in contributors' workflows.
- Add a small static-analysis/complexity check (e.g., eslint complexity rules, SonarCloud/GitHub code scanning) if the codebase grows, and add a small checklist in CONTRIBUTING.md noting which linters to run locally.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (90% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- Well-structured testing setup: a comprehensive Vitest unit test suite with jsdom, all unit tests pass locally, and coverage run reports 100% for core UI files. Playwright E2E tests and CI integration exist but were not executed here; E2E depends on a preview server and browser installs.
- Test framework: Vitest configured for jsdom via config/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts and vitest.config.ts (setupFiles: tests/setup.ts).
- E2E framework: Playwright present with tests in tests/e2e, playwright.config.ts, and scripts/run-e2e.sh to run against a preview server.
- Scripts: package.json exposes test, test:coverage, test:ci and e2e:ci; CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs type-check, lint, build, test:ci and E2E steps and uploads artifacts.
- Found test files: 4 unit test files in tests/ (coverage-increase.test.ts, health-check-utils.test.ts, main.test.ts, prepare-libraries.test.ts) and an E2E spec tests/e2e/app.spec.ts.
- Executed unit tests locally (npm test): Vitest ran 4 test files, 14 tests — all passed (14/14).
- Coverage: npm run test:coverage produced v8 coverage and reported 100% statements/branches/functions/lines for app.ts and main.ts.
- Coverage policy: vitest-jsdom.ts sets coverage provider and enforces thresholds (90% for branches/functions/lines/statements).
- Good testing practices observed: DOM cleanup in setup, usage of testing-library/jest-dom, and mocking with vi for deterministic tests.
- E2E caveat: Playwright tests require a running preview server and browser binaries; E2E was not run in this assessment, so their pass/fail status here is unverified.
- Scope note: Many non-UI files and scripts are explicitly excluded from coverage (scripts/**, config/**, etc.), so coverage numbers reflect the tested UI entrypoints primarily.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the Playwright E2E suite locally (npm run e2e:ci or scripts/run-e2e.sh) to verify E2E tests pass and to detect environment-specific flakiness (ensure Playwright browsers are installed).
- If integration tests for scripts and tooling are desired, add tests that exercise scripts/ and other currently excluded modules or reduce exclusions where appropriate.
- Confirm CI enforces coverage thresholds and fails the job when thresholds are not met (test:ci should enforce; if not, add an explicit coverage-check step).
- Add periodic E2E stability monitoring and investigate flaky runs if any appear in CI artifacts; consider running Playwright in a reproducible container for local parity with CI.
- Expand unit/integration test coverage beyond the core UI files where business logic exists to increase confidence across the codebase.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (70% ± 13% COMPLETE)
- The project builds and unit tests run successfully, and basic runtime checks are present; however serving the built site reliably failed in my environment (preview server produced timeouts / 404s and the built output could not be consistently verified). Execution is generally good (build+tests) but running/previewing the app has gaps that prevent a higher score.
- Tests: npm run test (vitest) executed and all tests passed — 4 test files, 14 tests total (output: "4 passed (4) ... 14 passed (14)").
- Build: npm run build completed successfully. Vite build log reported generated files (dist/index.html, dist/assets/...) and "✓ built in 237ms".
- Preview/start: Running npm run preview without background failed with a spawnSync ETIMEDOUT initially. A background preview process was started (start_server returned a background pid), but requests were unreliable.
- Server reachability: Headless browser tests to http://localhost:5173 returned net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED. vite.config.ts defines preview.port=4173; requests to 4173 returned a 404 resource error in the headless browser and curl to 4173 returned no content.
- Dist directory inconsistency: build log indicated dist files, but listing/ls failed (dist directory did not exist when listing), so I could not directly inspect the built artifacts on disk in this environment.
- Runtime dependencies & engine: package.json lists runtime deps (@microsoft/clarity, gsap, three). package.json enforces Node >=22.17.0 (so a modern Node runtime is required).
- Basic runtime error handling: src/app.ts includes defensive checks (verifies #app exists and logs an error and returns if missing), which is good for simple client-side execution.
- CI / tests presence: There are unit tests, test setup, and e2e/playwright configuration files present — project is set up for automated checks though I did not run e2e playwright tests here.

**Next Steps:**
- Fix and verify preview/start behavior: ensure vite preview uses the intended port and that npm run preview reliably serves the built output. Confirm there are no conflicting background vite processes and avoid ETIMEDOUT when launching (increase spawn timeout or run in foreground during debugging).
- Confirm build artifacts on disk after build: investigate why dist cannot be listed after build (check build scripts, workspace filters, or .voderignore/.gitignore filtering). Add an explicit post-build check to validate dist contents in CI.
- Stabilize local preview in CI: add an automated CI step that starts the preview server, waits for readiness, and performs a smoke test (curl / headless browser) to verify the site serves index.html and main assets.
- Improve runtime logging and error reporting: augment preview/start scripts to print server URL and health-check endpoint. For client runtime, consider a small health-check console or network error handlers for asset loading to surface 404s.
- Document runtime requirements: update README with Node engine requirement, exact commands to build/preview, and port details (avoid mismatch between configured preview.port and runtime invocation).
- If port conflicts are common in environments, consider making preview port configurable via env var (VITE_PORT or similar) and add a guard to fail fast if the port is occupied.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (80% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is good for developer onboarding and design decisions (comprehensive README, a Developer Setup guide, Architectural Decision Records, and per-library notes). However there are some gaps: no changelog/release notes, a couple of empty docs, a declared docs script that references a missing helper, and no dedicated API reference or detailed code docstrings. Overall usable for contributors but not fully production-grade documentation.
- README.md present and substantive: contains quick-start, build/dev/test/lint instructions, troubleshooting and contact guidance (README.md).
- Developer onboarding doc present: docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md provides step-by-step verification and CI-local guidance.
- Architectural Decision Records exist: docs/decisions/* contains many ADRs describing architectural choices and rationale.
- Per-library documentation available: docs/libraries/ contains many package-specific markdown docs describing dependencies and rationale.
- Security and audit artifacts documented: SECURITY.md, audit-summary.md, ci-audit-summary.md and .github workflows are present and describe automated scans.
- Tests run successfully locally: npm run test completed with 4 test files and 14 tests passing (Vitest output observed).
- Several docs are empty or placeholders: docs/CI-AUDIT.md and docs/E2E-REPRO.md contain no content (empty files).
- Missing referenced helper script: package.json defines scripts docs:setup and docs:report that run node setup-package-docs.js, but no setup-package-docs.js was found in the repository (script appears stale or missing).
- No changelog/release notes found: search did not find CHANGELOG* or changelog files.
- No dedicated API reference found: there is no API documentation (OpenAPI, typedoc, or similar) — the project is small/static, but an explicit statement or API docs are missing.
- Code documentation is light: source files have brief inline comments but lack JSDoc-style docstrings for exported functions; app.ts and main.ts have short comments only.

**Next Steps:**
- Add a changelog or release notes (CHANGELOG.md) and adopt a release process (Keep a short history for consumers and maintainers).
- Either add the missing docs helper (setup-package-docs.js) and document the docs generation workflow, or remove/adjust the docs:setup and docs:report scripts to avoid referencing a missing file.
- Fill in placeholder/empty docs (docs/CI-AUDIT.md, docs/E2E-REPRO.md) or remove them if not needed; ensure docs reflect the current CI and E2E reproduction steps.
- If the project exposes any public APIs (even small DOM init functions), add a minimal API reference (typedoc/JSDoc or a brief API.md) or a short section in README describing public exports and their contract.
- Improve inline code documentation for exported functions (add JSDoc comments for public APIs) so maintainers and automated doc tools can consume them.
- Consider adding a short architecture overview (diagram or ARCHITECTURE.md) that summarizes the site structure and runtime pieces and links to ADRs for deeper details.
- Add a brief documentation-generation verification step to CI (or ensure docs-related scripts are tested) so missing/invalid doc scripts are caught early.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (88% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are declared and locked, node_modules is present, and automated security audits/reporting show zero vulnerabilities. The repository contains audit artifacts and security/health scripts. I could not run a full outdated check in this environment, so the assessment is strong for correctness and security scanning but incomplete for freshness/outdatedness verification.
- package.json present and lists runtime dependencies: @microsoft/clarity, gsap, three, plus a comprehensive set of devDependencies (linters, test tooling, build tools).
- package-lock.json exists in the repository root (lockfile present) and node_modules/ directory exists, enabling reproducible installs and local tooling execution.
- Executed 'npm audit --json' — audit.json produced and reports 0 vulnerabilities (critical/high/moderate/low = 0). audit.json metadata: prod=27, dev=743, total=769.
- Executed 'npm ls --depth=0 --json' — top-level installed packages match package.json (evidence of installed/consistent dependency tree).
- Repository contains audit artifacts (audit.json, ci-audit.json, audit-summary.md) and SECURITY.md documenting automated scans (daily security audit, secret scan, CodeQL), indicating security scanning is configured.
- Health-check script (scripts/health-check.js) enforces presence of package-lock.json and node_modules and runs type-check, lint, and format checks — useful for CI/developer dependency hygiene.
- Attempted 'npm outdated' and 'npm outdated --json' in this environment but the command failed; therefore I could not verify outdatedness/available upgrades for dependencies here.
- Could not directly read package-lock.json content due to repository ignore patterns in this environment; relied on npm CLI outputs for dependency metadata.

**Next Steps:**
- Run a local or CI outdated check: npm outdated --json (or npm outdated) to identify packages with available updates and review which updates are safe to apply.
- Run npm audit after updates and run npm audit fix where appropriate; review package-lock.json diffs carefully before committing any automated fixes.
- Enable or confirm automated dependency update tooling (Dependabot or Renovate) to open PRs for dependency updates, including devDependencies, and configure update cadence.
- When updating dependencies, run the full verify workflow (npm run verify) or at minimum: npm ci, npm run type-check, npm run lint:check, npm run format:check, npm run build, npm test to catch regressions.
- Consider generating and publishing an SBOM (CycloneDX/SPDX) as part of CI and continue uploading audit artifacts for traceability (already referenced in SECURITY.md).
- If reproducible builds are required, ensure CI uses npm ci and lockfile is kept in sync with package.json; enforce PR checks that fail if package-lock.json is out of date.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (78% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- Overall the repository shows a solid security posture for a small static site: automated security workflows (npm audit, CodeQL, gitleaks) and Dependabot are present and run; current npm audit artifacts show no vulnerabilities. No obvious hardcoded secrets were found in source files inspected. There are a few practical issues and hardening opportunities (production sourcemaps enabled, a fragile secret-scan failure condition, and standard recommendations around branch protection and artifact handling) which keep this from being near-excellent.
- Automated security workflows present: .github/workflows/security-audit.yml (npm audit + SBOM), .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml (gitleaks), .github/workflows/code-scanning.yml (CodeQL). (Files inspected.)
- npm audit results: audit.json and audit-summary.md show 0 critical/high/moderate/low/info vulnerabilities (audit.json metadata reports total 0). Evidence: audit.json, audit-summary.md, ci-audit-summary.md.
- Secret scanning: .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml uses zricethezav/gitleaks-action@v2 with --redact and uploads repo-secrets-scan artifacts. repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt and repo-secrets-scan.txt in the repo are empty. No hardcoded secrets detected in the source files inspected (src/, scripts/, .github/, README, package.json).
- Potential workflow logic issue: the 'Fail if secrets detected' step in .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml uses 'if: steps.gitleaks-scan.outputs.exit-code == '1'' but the preceding step does not set an explicit step id. This conditional is fragile and may not behave as intended — risk that the workflow won't reliably fail on detected secrets depending on action outputs/step ids.
- Sourcemap exposure risk: vite.config.ts sets build.sourcemap: true, which will produce source maps in the production build. If sourcemaps are published or served publicly, they can leak source and secrets (e.g., URLs, internal logic).
- Secrets usage in CI is via GitHub Actions secrets (VITE_SENTRY_DSN referenced in .github/workflows/ci.yml). Using secrets (not hardcoded values) is correct practice; ensure secrets are not echoed in logs.
- CodeQL is enabled for JavaScript/TypeScript with appropriate upload of SARIF; Dependabot is configured (weekly) for npm dependency updates. These are good automated controls.
- Project is a static front-end site (no server-side auth code present) which reduces attack surface, but it still depends on many devDependencies (audit metadata shows many dev deps) and some runtime browser libs (three, gsap, @microsoft/clarity) that should be kept up-to-date.
- Health-check and audit helper scripts exist (.github/scripts/parse-audit.js; scripts/health-check.js) and are reasonably robust (parse-audit exits non-zero on high/critical advisories).

**Next Steps:**
- Remove or disable generation of public production sourcemaps (set build.sourcemap to false for production builds) or ensure sourcemaps are stored privately (and not deployed to public hosting) to prevent source leakage.
- Fix the secret-scan workflow to fail reliably on detected secrets: give the gitleaks step an explicit id (e.g., id: gitleaks) and use that id when checking outputs, or rely on the action's exit code (avoid a fragile conditional). Example: set 'id: gitleaks' on the step and then check 'if: steps.gitleaks.outputs.exit-code == '1'' or simply allow the action to fail and fail the job.
- Run a dedicated secrets scan locally (gitleaks or trufflehog) including scanning package-lock.json and other generated files (sometimes secrets leak into lockfiles or assets). Review repo-secrets-scan artifacts in CI and, if any real secrets are found, rotate them immediately.
- Enforce required status checks and branch protection in GitHub (require CodeQL code scanning, secret-scan, and security-audit/Dependabot checks to pass before merging).
- Ensure CI does not print secrets to logs (review workflows for commands that might echo environment variables) and redact sensitive output in job steps where necessary.
- Continue to keep dependencies up-to-date (Dependabot enabled), and consider enabling automatic security updates for low-risk packages. Periodically review audit artifacts (audit.json/audit-summary.md) and triage high/critical findings promptly.
- Consider adding a short security section to README/CONTRIBUTING that documents how to report/security triage, how to run local scans (npm run security:local), and how to rotate secrets if accidentally committed.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Version control is well-established: remote origin exists, active branches and recent commits, clear and useful commit messages (conventional-style), a comprehensive .gitignore, and pre-commit hooks via Husky. Issues: working tree is not clean (several modified tracked files), some transient/artifact files appear tracked (playwright-results.json and files under .voder), and one local branch is ahead of origin. These are easy-to-fix maintenance items rather than fundamental VCS problems.
- Git remote configured: origin -> https://github.com/mountain-pass/voder.ai-website.git
- Current branch: fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage (local HEAD). Branch is shown as ahead 1 relative to origin (git branch -avv).
- Recent commit history is present and descriptive (conventional commit style: e.g. "ci(e2e): make run-e2e.sh portable and run verifier to catch missing tests/artifacts").
- Working directory is not clean: git status/porcelain shows modified tracked files (.voder/history.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/.processes.json and playwright-results.json).
- .gitignore is present and reasonably comprehensive (node_modules, build outputs, logs, test-results patterns, etc.).
- Husky pre-commit hooks exist (.husky/pre-commit) and run type-check, format and lint checks, indicating checks are enforced locally when hooks run.
- No untracked (ignored) files reported by git ls-files --others --exclude-standard — repository does not have stray untracked content, only modified tracked files.
- CI workflows are configured (.github/workflows/ci.yml and others) showing an established CI process integrated with the repository.

**Next Steps:**
- Clean or commit the working tree: either commit the intended changes to .voder/* and playwright-results.json, or restore them if they were created accidentally (git add/commit or git restore).
- If certain files are transient (playwright-results.json, .voder/* artifacts), add them to .gitignore and remove from history/tracking (git rm --cached <file> then commit).
- Audit why .voder files are tracked: if these are ephemeral/debug data, they should be ignored; if they contain required metadata, consider moving to a clearly named tracked path and documenting their purpose.
- Push or reconcile branches that are ahead (e.g., push fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage if the change is ready) or rebase/squash if the branch needs cleaning before push.
- Consider adding a policy (CONTRIBUTING or README note) about not committing CI/test artifacts and how to handle local artifacts to avoid accidental commits.
- Optionally add repository tags/releases and enable signed commits or enforce verified commits if stronger provenance is desired.
