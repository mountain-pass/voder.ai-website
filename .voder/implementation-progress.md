# Implementation Progress Report

**Generated**: October 23, 2025 at 11:31 AM  
**Assessment Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED BY DEPENDENCIES  
**Phase Completed**: Phase 1 (Dependencies Validation) - FAILED  



---

## Executive Summary

Assessment **BLOCKED** at Phase 1 (Dependencies Validation). Out of 12 packages with available updates, only 1 meets the 7-day maturity requirement per the Smart Package Selection Algorithm. The remaining 11 packages are too fresh (< 7 days old) to safely upgrade without additional risk. Current versions have only **2 LOW severity vulnerabilities** which are non-blocking but should be addressed.

**Recommendation**: Remain on current package versions until updated packages mature (>= 7 days old), then reassess for safe upgrades.

   - ‚úÖ Meets 7-day maturity requirement
   - ‚úÖ No security vulnerabilities
   - ‚úÖ Patch version update (low risk)
   - **Recommendation**: Safe to upgrade immediately

#### Deferred Actions (Wait for Maturity)

The following 11 packages should **NOT** be upgraded yet as they don't meet the 7-day maturity requirement:

- netlify-cli@23.9.3 (needs 6 more days - safe on 2025-10-29)

**Major Version Updates (Requires Additional Analysis)**:
- vitest: 3.2.4 ‚Üí 4.0.1 (published 2025-10-20, 3 days old)
- @vitest/coverage-v8: 3.2.4 ‚Üí 4.0.1 (published 2025-10-22, 1 day old)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking changes likely
  - üìã Requires migration guide review
  - ‚è≥ Wait for 7-day maturity (safe on 2025-10-29)
  - üîç Then assess breaking changes before upgrading

### Exception Analysis

Per Smart Package Selection Algorithm, we checked if current versions have security issues that would warrant accepting fresh packages:

- ‚úÖ **No moderate or higher vulnerabilities** in current versions
- ‚úÖ **2 LOW vulnerabilities** have fix available via netlify-cli (can wait for maturity)
- ‚úÖ **No urgent security-driven exceptions needed**

**Conclusion**: No security-driven exceptions required. Safe to wait for package maturity.
