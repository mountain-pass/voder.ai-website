Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 48.5

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (75% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The repository shows a solid engineering foundation (build, linting, tests, and CI artifacts), but does not meet the required thresholds in several critical areas. Testing health is weak (50%) and documentation is effectively absent (0%), which blocks a COMPLETE status. Dependencies and security are good but slightly under the required 90% threshold. Prioritize improving unit/e2e stability and adding comprehensive documentation and CI artifact capture to reach the project's required quality gates.

## NEXT PRIORITY

Add comprehensive documentation and stabilize failing tests: produce developer setup docs, ensure CI uploads tsc/lint/format/test logs and coverage artifacts, and fix the failing Playwright/CI tests so the Testing score moves above the required threshold.

## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 16% COMPLETE)

- The repository contains a small but complete static site application with clear main entry points, unit tests, and developer tooling. Automated tests run and pass locally (14 tests). Core runtime behavior (initializing and rendering the #app DOM node) is implemented and covered by tests. Minor gaps (no package-lock.json / node_modules in the repo which the health-check script expects) and limited runtime/system-level smoke tests (dev server/build not exercised here) keep this from being rated higher.
- Main entry points present: src/main.ts (imports ./app.js and style), index.html loads /src/main.ts as module.
- Core feature implemented: src/app.ts export function init() populates the #app element with the site content (heading, copy, subtitle).
- Tests present under tests/ (main.test.ts, coverage-increase.test.ts, health-check-utils.test.ts, prepare-libraries.test.ts) exercising app init, main behavior, and utility scripts.
- Test run executed: npm run test -> Vitest ran successfully: 4 test files, 14 tests passed (no failures).
- Build / dev tooling present: vite, TypeScript config (tsconfig.\*.json), vite.config.ts, and scripts in package.json (dev, build, preview, type-check, lint, etc.).
- Health/maintenance scripts exist: scripts/health-check.js and scripts/prepare-libraries.js with corresponding TypeScript utilities and tests.
- Health-check expects package-lock.json and node_modules to be present; repository currently does not include package-lock.json or node_modules (health-check.js would fail without them).
- Project is a minimal static pre-launch site (not a multi-endpoint web service); no API endpoints or CLI are present/required by the codebase.

**Next Steps:**

- Add and commit package-lock.json (or ensure CI provides a lockfile) and install dependencies to allow scripts/health-check.js to run end-to-end locally.
- Run and verify production build (npm run build) and preview (npm run preview) locally to validate the build pipeline and generated output in dist/ (smoke test the generated site).
- Add a lightweight end-to-end or browser smoke test (Playwright / Puppeteer) to verify the rendered page in a real browser environment (confirm CSS, runtime errors, and script loading).
- Consider adding a simple CI job that runs npm ci, npm run build, and npm test to catch environment/build regressions automatically.
- If the project will expand beyond a static pre-launch site, add API/CLI tests and more extensive integration tests as appropriate.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (88% ± 14% COMPLETE)

- The project demonstrates strong code-quality foundations: comprehensive lint/format configs (ESLint flat config, Prettier, Stylelint, HTMLHint), TypeScript usage, modular config, and a test suite with 100% coverage for the existing source files. A small number of issues remain (Prettier reported styling problems in an untracked markdown file), and the codebase is small so some quality aspects (broader test coverage, stricter enforcement in CI) could be improved.
- Linting & formatting configuration present: eslint.config.ts + modular config files under config/eslint/, prettier.config.ts, stylelint.config.ts, htmlhint.config.js and .markdownlint.json — strong tooling in place.
- ESLint is configured with TypeScript-aware parser and plugins (@typescript-eslint, import, simple-import-sort). The project uses the ESLint flat config exported from config files.
- Tests: vitest suite executed (npm run test:ci). All tests passed: 14/14 tests. Coverage report shows 100% coverage for src/app.ts and src/main.ts.
- Formatting: running npm run format:check produced Prettier warnings. Output shows code style issues in prompts/developer-guide.md and the command exited non-zero (Prettier suggests running --write to fix).
- HTML linting: npm run lint:html reported 'Scanned 1 files, no errors found'.
- CSS linting and ESLint script invocations were present in package.json (lint:css, lint, lint:check), and running them returned no visible errors in this environment (no output).
- Code organization: small, focused 'src' directory (app.ts, main.ts, style.css) with clear separation of initialization logic for testability (init exported from app.ts).
- Error handling: app.ts checks for missing #app element and logs an error instead of throwing — graceful handling for DOM absence.
- Naming and style: consistent naming and idiomatic TypeScript usage in source files; configs are modular and well-structured.
- No evidence of code duplication in the small codebase; tests and utils are separated under tests/ and config/ files are separated under config/.

**Next Steps:**

- Fix formatting issues reported by Prettier: run npm run format (or npm run format:check -> identify files -> run npm run format) and commit changes. Ensure untracked files that should be linted are included or intentionally ignored.
- Enable/verify CI enforcement of the 'verify' script (or equivalent) so linting (eslint, stylelint, htmlhint), formatting checks, type-check, build, and tests run on PRs. The package.json 'verify' script already chains these checks — add it to CI if not present.
- Run a type-check (npm run type-check) and include it in CI to catch type-level issues; currently the project has TypeScript configs but I did not run type-check here.
- Tighten lint rules where appropriate (for example consider enabling stricter @typescript-eslint rules such as no-explicit-any) and adopt lint:fix in pre-commit hooks (husky / lint-staged) to keep code consistent.
- Expand test coverage beyond the minimal app/main files to cover more real logic and edge cases (utils, build scripts, config behavior) and add coverage thresholds to fail CI on regressions.
- Investigate and fix any silent or ambiguous linter command outputs in automated runs (ensure npm run lint and npm run lint:css return non-zero on warnings if you want strict enforcement, or use --max-warnings 0 where appropriate).
- Add pre-commit or pre-push hooks (lint-staged + husky) to auto-format and lint staged files to reduce style regressions committed to the repo.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (50% ± 16% COMPLETE)

- Local unit tests are well-configured and all pass with full coverage for exercised files, but recurring CI pipeline failures (Playwright e2e and related workflows) indicate test health problems in CI. Because CI tests are failing, the overall testing score is capped at 50%.
- Test files found: tests/coverage-increase.test.ts, tests/health-check-utils.test.ts, tests/main.test.ts, tests/prepare-libraries.test.ts, and tests/setup.ts.
- Testing framework: Vitest is used (vitest.config.ts present). package.json includes scripts test, test:coverage, test:ci and devDependencies include vitest, @testing-library/dom, @testing-library/jest-dom, happy-dom.
- Local test run (npm test): 4 test files, 14 tests — all passed. Vitest output shows all tests passed.
- Coverage (npm run test:coverage): v8 provider used; report shows 100% statements/branches/functions/lines for app.ts and main.ts and overall 100% for the exercised files.
- Types of tests present: unit-style DOM tests for src/app and src/main, utility tests for scripts/health-check-utils, and filesystem-simulation tests for prepare-libraries (unit + small integration simulation).
- Test hygiene: tests/setup.ts clears DOM between tests; tests use vi mocks/spies and reset modules where appropriate.
- CI evidence: GitHub Actions recent runs show repeated failures for 'CI & Playwright multi-browser tests' and some Security Audit jobs; failures are recent and recurring.
- No local Playwright configuration file (playwright.config.\*) was found, suggesting a mismatch between CI e2e expectations and repository-local configuration.

**Next Steps:**

- Inspect failing GitHub Actions logs for the 'CI & Playwright multi-browser tests' job to determine root causes (missing Playwright installation, environment/setup steps, or test flakiness).
- If Playwright e2e tests are intended: add a repository Playwright config (playwright.config.ts), document local run steps, and ensure CI installs Playwright browsers (or set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_INSTALL) before running e2e jobs.
- If Playwright jobs are not intended: update CI workflows to remove or gate those jobs to avoid false-negative pipeline status.
- Add coverage threshold checks in CI so the build fails if coverage drops below the target, preventing regressions.
- Expand test coverage to include other critical code paths (e.g., scripts/\*, build scripts) or explicitly exclude intentionally untested files from coverage to clarify reports.
- After fixing CI failures, re-run CI until pipelines are consistently green and then reassess the testing score (passing CI with good coverage should increase the percentage).

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (92% ± 17% COMPLETE)

- The project executes very well: dependencies install, the production build completes, unit tests and coverage run cleanly, and TypeScript/lint checks pass. The app contains basic runtime error handling and a static build is produced. I could not reliably start the preview server in this execution environment (spawn/timeout), but the produced dist artifacts indicate a successful build and the app code is testable and robust.
- npm ci completed successfully and installed dependencies (no vulnerabilities reported by npm audit in this run).
- Node.js version on the runner is v22.17.1 which satisfies package.json engines requirement (>=22.17.0).
- npm run build (Vite) completed successfully; dist/ contains index.html and compiled assets (CSS, JS, images, model).
- Unit tests: npm run test executed all tests: 4 files, 14 tests — all passed.
- Coverage: npm run test:coverage produced 100% coverage for src/app.ts and src/main.ts.
- Type checking and lint commands were invoked (no failures surfaced when run during assessment).
- Runtime behavior: src/app.init() handles missing #app by logging an error and returning (explicit error handling present).
- App entry (src/main.ts) correctly defers initialization until DOMContentLoaded or calls init immediately when ready; tests cover both paths.
- Health-check scripts exist to validate environment (scripts/health-check.js and scripts/health-check-utils.js) and include helpful remediation messages.
- Attempt to run npm run preview in this environment failed to start a stable background server due to a spawn/timeout/environment limitation; however, the build artifacts in dist/ indicate the application was produced correctly and can be served by any static server.

**Next Steps:**

- Locally (or in CI), run a preview/serve of the built dist (e.g., npm run preview or serve dist/) to verify the production bundle serves correctly and exercise the site in a browser.
- Add a small smoke-test in CI that starts the preview server and performs an HTTP request to / to assert 200 OK (this would catch runtime/serving regressions).
- Add an end-to-end or headless browser test (Playwright/Puppeteer) to exercise the built site and surface console errors or rendering regressions in CI.
- Ensure npm run preview works in the intended CI or deployment environment; if spawning fails in restricted environments, document an alternative (e.g., a dedicated container or static host step) and add a non-interactive smoke-test step.
- Consider adding a simple npm start script that serves dist/ with a minimal static server for easier local verification, and add a README note on how to preview the production build.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (0% ± 20% COMPLETE)

- Assessment failed due to error: Assessment was cancelled
- Error occurred during DOCUMENTATION assessment: Assessment was cancelled

**Next Steps:**

- Check assessment system configuration
- Verify project accessibility

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)

- Dependency management is in good shape: a single, valid package.json is present, a package-lock exists, and an npm audit run (and stored audit artifacts) reports zero known vulnerabilities. The project has many transitive/dev dependencies which increases surface area; I could not run an automated 'npm outdated' check in this environment, so I couldn't verify how many direct/transitive packages are out-of-date.
- Manifest: package.json present and valid. Top-level runtime dependencies (dependencies) are: @microsoft/clarity ^1.0.0, gsap ^3.13.0, three ^0.180.0. Many devDependencies are also declared (eslint, vitest, typescript, vite, etc.).
- Lockfile: package-lock.json exists (checked), indicating deterministic installs and that a lockfile is in use.
- Vulnerability scan: npm audit --json returned no vulnerabilities (auditReportVersion 2, metadata shows 0 critical/high/moderate/low). audit.json and SECURITY.md in the repo corroborate a clean audit output.
- Audit metadata: npm audit metadata indicates a large dependency surface (metadata: total dependencies 765; prod 27, dev 739), i.e. many transitive/dev packages are present.
- Installed tree: npm ls --all --json completed and shows the full dependency tree (many transitive packages shown), confirming the lockfile installs a non-trivial tree (transitive package versions available).
- Outdated check: attempts to run 'npm outdated' (and 'npm outdated --json') failed in this environment (command returned an error), so automated outdated-package detection could not be performed here.
- Security tooling / scripts: package.json contains audit-related scripts (audit:fix, security:local) and a 'verify' script that runs audit:fix + lint + build + tests — good CI/maintainer hooks exist.
- Node engine: package.json declares node >=22.17.0 — explicit engine declared (good).

**Next Steps:**

- Run 'npm outdated' (or 'npm outdated --json') locally or in CI to identify outdated direct and transitive packages and prioritize updates. If network restrictions caused the failure here, run it in a dev environment with network access.
- Enable automated dependency update PRs (Dependabot, Renovate) to proactively surface and test updates for direct dependencies and reduce bit-rot.
- Add or enable a continuous npm audit step in CI (fail or warn on new vulnerabilities) and ensure audit.json is regenerated periodically; consider adding SCA tooling (Snyk, GitHub Advanced Security) for continuous monitoring of transitive issues.
- Reduce dev dependency surface where practical (remove unused dev tools, or move large tooling to a separate dev-only script image) to lower maintenance and transient attack surface.
- Pin or use a lockfile policy and review lockfile commits (the repo appears to use package-lock.json — ensure it is kept up-to-date and committed when dependencies change). Consider using exact versions for critical runtime dependencies if required for reproducible production builds.
- Schedule regular dependency maintenance (monthly or quarterly) and include 'npm outdated' + automated tests in that workflow so updates are validated before merging.
- If you want, I can (when network/permission allows) re-run 'npm outdated' and attempt to produce a prioritized list of packages to update and any known breaking changes.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 17% COMPLETE)

- Overall the repository has a low surface area and shows good basic security hygiene: npm audit reports zero vulnerabilities, tests pass, and an automated secrets scan appears to have found nothing. A few operational/hardening gaps remain (missing CI security helper referenced in package.json, reliance on innerHTML for rendering, and lack of explicit content-security / other security headers/meta in the static site), so I rate it high-quality with some minor issues to address.
- npm audit result: audit.json contains zero vulnerabilities (metadata.vulnerabilities.total = 0). I also ran `npm audit --json` and got the same result.
- Dependency listing: production deps are @microsoft/clarity, gsap, three. Dev deps are present; `npm ls --prod --depth=0` / `npm ls --dev --depth=0` show installed packages.
- Tests: `npm test` completed successfully — 14 tests passed across 4 test files (Vitest).
- Secrets scan: repo-secrets-scan.txt and repo-secrets-scan.redacted.txt are empty; recursive grep for common secret keywords found no matches (no obvious hardcoded API keys, tokens, passwords, etc.).
- Static site security hardening: index.html has no Content-Security-Policy or other security-related meta tags; there are no server headers in repo (hosting-level headers are not configured here).
- XSS surface: src/app.ts uses element.innerHTML with a template string. Currently the string is static (no user input), but this pattern can introduce XSS risk if future changes insert user-controlled content via that code path.
- Analytics/privacy: @microsoft/clarity is included as a production dependency. Analytics/telemetry can have privacy/security implications — repository does not include consent/opt-in code or documentation for data collection.
- Missing referenced script: package.json defines a security:local script that runs `node .github/scripts/parse-audit.js audit.json`, but the .github/scripts path is not present in the repo (the .github directory is empty). This indicates a broken local security helper/automation reference.
- package-lock.json and node_modules exist locally (health-check scripts expect them); health-check.js includes checks and uses only built-ins and appears implemented to avoid shell-injection (spawn with shell: false).
- No CI/GitHub Actions workflows present in the repository to automatically run dependency audits, secret scanning, or automated security updates (the .github directory is empty).

**Next Steps:**

- Add Content-Security-Policy (CSP) and other recommended security headers (X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options) at hosting or via meta tags; enforce a strict CSP to mitigate XSS risk.
- Avoid using element.innerHTML for rendering dynamic/user-controlled content. Replace with safe DOM APIs or templates. If innerHTML must be used, sanitize inputs strictly.
- Review and document the usage of @microsoft/clarity (analytics): ensure compliance with privacy requirements and add user consent/opt-out if required by target audience/region.
- Fix or remove broken local security automation: either add .github/scripts/parse-audit.js or update package.json to point to the correct helper script so `npm run security:local` works.
- Add automated security checks to CI (GitHub Actions or equivalent): run `npm audit --json`, run a secrets scanner, and optionally run Dependabot or another SCA tool to keep dependencies monitored and up-to-date.
- Enable secret scanning in the repository and enforce policies to prevent committing plaintext secrets (add pre-commit hooks or CI checks).
- Add SRI (Subresource Integrity) for any third-party CDN assets if/when external scripts/styles are included.
- Periodically run npm audit and schedule automated update/patching (Dependabot or Renovate) for dependencies; add an automated alerting process for new vulnerabilities.
- Consider adding a minimal SECURITY.md entry describing how to report security issues (there is a SECURITY.md present but add contact/process details and ensure tools referenced there exist and run in CI).

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (88% ± 17% COMPLETE)

- Version control is well-managed: clear, conventional commit history, tags, branch 'main' in sync with origin, a comprehensive .gitignore, Husky pre-commit hook present, and a clean working tree except for a single untracked prompts file. Minor issues: one untracked file (prompts/developer-guide.md), no .gitattributes, and several local 'cleanup/\*' branches exist (not present on origin), which could be cleaned or pushed as needed.
- git status (porcelain -b) shows a clean working tree except: '?? prompts/developer-guide.md' (an untracked file).
- Current branch: main (git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD => main).
- Local main is in sync with origin/main (git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...main => 0 0).
- Recent commit history is present and well-structured; commit messages use conventional style (examples from git log --oneline: 'chore: clean up imports...', 'feat: add DORA-style trunk-based development ADR', 'docs: add README...').
- Author config is set to 'voder-bot <voder-bot@example.com>' (git config --get user.name/email).
- Tags exist (git tag -n shows v1.0.0-complete and v1.0.1).
- .gitignore exists and is comprehensive for typical node/static site artifacts (node_modules/, dist/, coverage/, .env, etc.).
- .husky/pre-commit exists and enforces check-only quality gates: 'npm run format:check', 'npm run lint:check', 'npm run type-check'.
- No .gitattributes file present in repo (could be useful for line endings, export-ignore, linguist overrides).
- Multiple local branches exist (git branch -a lists cleanup/\* branches) while the remote only shows remotes/origin/main — these local branches appear not to be pushed.
- There is a prior commit referencing removal of secrets and .env (commit 'removed secrets' shows .env removed), and there are repo-secrets-scan files in the tree (repo-secrets-scan.txt and .redacted), indicating attention to secret handling.

**Next Steps:**

- Decide whether 'prompts/developer-guide.md' should be tracked or ignored: either git add and commit it (if intended) or add an appropriate pattern to .gitignore (or .voderignore) to keep it untracked.
- Add a .gitattributes file to ensure consistent line endings and to mark paths to exclude from exports if needed (and to help with language detection and diff behavior).
- Review local 'cleanup/\*' branches: delete stale ones or push them to remote if they represent ongoing work to avoid local branch sprawl.
- Confirm Husky is installed/activated for contributors (document 'npm run prepare' if required) so pre-commit hooks actually run for devs; consider adding a note in README contributing section about running 'npm ci'/'npm run prepare' to enable hooks.
- Validate that secrets were fully removed: run a repository secret scan workflow or use git-secrets / other tooling to ensure no sensitive data remains in history or lingering files.
- Consider configuring branch protection rules and requiring signed or reviewed commits on main in the remote hosting service (GitHub/GitLab) to enforce trunk-based practices referenced in docs.
