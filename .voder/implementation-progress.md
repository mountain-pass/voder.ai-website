![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (36.25% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The repository has strong foundations (TypeScript, ESLint/Prettier, Vite, Vitest config, ADRs) but fails key acceptance thresholds. Functionality, Security and Version Control assessments are effectively zero; testing and documentation are insufficient; dependencies are reasonable. Many architectural and tooling choices are explicitly documented in ADRs and should not be penalized. Immediate work should focus on restoring reproducible verification (health-check, tests, and CI), raising test coverage, and closing security/version-control gaps.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Run the non-interactive health-check locally (npm run health-check), fix any failures (type-check, lint:check, format:check), and iterate until npm run verify completes successfully.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (0% ± 20% COMPLETE)
- Assessment failed due to error: Assessment was cancelled
- Error occurred during FUNCTIONALITY assessment: Assessment was cancelled

**Next Steps:**
- Check assessment system configuration
- Verify project accessibility

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (75% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Overall the project shows good code-quality practices: formal ESLint + TypeScript-aware config, Prettier, stylelint/htmlhint, a small test suite with Vitest, and clear project structure. A few lint warnings remain, Prettier reports style issues in several files, and I could not successfully run the TypeScript type-check step in this environment (tsc/type-check commands failed). Fixing the remaining linter/formatter warnings and ensuring type-check passes will raise the score.
- ESLint is present and configured as a flat ESM config (eslint.config.ts) with layered configs in config/eslint (base, dx, performance).
- Project exposes lint scripts in package.json (lint, lint:fix, lint:check) and a verify script that chains type-check, linters, formatting, build and tests.
- Running eslint produced warnings: initial run reported 7 warnings (0 errors) across scripts/prepare-libraries.js, src/app.ts, src/main.ts and tests/main.test.ts. eslint --fix reduced warnings to 3 (still present in scripts/prepare-libraries.js and src/main.ts).
- Prettier configuration exists (prettier.config.ts). Running format:check reported code style issues in 5 files and suggests running Prettier --write to fix.
- TypeScript config exists and enables strict mode via config/typescript/base.json and tsconfig.json references project config. However, running the type-check (tsc --noEmit) failed in this environment (command returned with no output), so I could not verify full type-safety.
- Tests exist (tests/main.test.ts and tests/setup.ts) and the test suite passes: vitest run shows 1 test passed.
- Vitest configuration (vitest.config.ts and config/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts) includes coverage thresholds (90% thresholds configured) and sensible jsdom setup.
- Code organization is simple and logical: src/ contains app.ts, main.ts, style.css; tests/ contains tests and setup; config/ holds linting/testing configs. Aliases are configured in vite and vitest.
- Naming conventions and style are consistent in the small codebase (camelCase, clear filenames).
- Error handling is present in app.ts (checks for #app element and logs error) though console usage is present and ESLint flags console statements in some files.
- No obvious code duplication in the small codebase. The scripts/prepare-libraries.js file contains some non-critical issues (unused import 'os', console usage) flagged by ESLint.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the TypeScript type-check locally (npm run type-check or npx tsc --noEmit) to get the actual type-check output and fix any reported issues. Ensure tsc runs in CI and adjust environment if necessary.
- Run Prettier with --write (npm run format) to resolve the reported style issues, then commit the formatted files.
- Fix remaining ESLint warnings (remove unused variables, sort imports or run eslint --fix, and reduce unexpected console statements). Aim for lint:check to succeed with zero warnings as the project scripts expect.
- Add or enable a CI job that runs npm run verify (or at least type-check, lint:check, format:check, and tests) to prevent regressions.
- Consider adding more unit/integration tests to raise coverage to the thresholds already present in the Vitest config, and run coverage during CI to verify.
- If console statements are legitimately required in some files, either use allowed methods (warn/error) or scope exceptions in ESLint so rules remain meaningful elsewhere.
- Add pre-commit hooks (e.g., via husky) to run lint-staged or format checks to keep code consistent before commits.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (35% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- A minimal unit test suite exists and the single unit test passes, but overall test coverage is extremely low and the coverage run fails the project's global thresholds. Test infrastructure is configured (Vitest, testing-library, jest-dom), CI expects coverage and E2E steps, but there are no E2E tests present and coverage/CI will fail until coverage or config is adjusted.
- Test files discovered: tests/main.test.ts and tests/setup.ts. The unit test exercises src/app.init and asserts DOM content.
- npm run test (vitest) succeeded: 1 test file run, 1 test passed.
- npm run test:coverage failed: reported coverage was lines 0.67%, statements 0.67%, functions 89.65%, branches 88.13% and failed global thresholds set at 90% (multiple ERRORs).
- Vitest configuration present (vitest.config.ts and config/ testing setup). Coverage reporting and thresholds are configured in the project.
- DevDependencies include testing tools (vitest, @testing-library/dom, @testing-library/jest-dom, jest-axe, axe-core, @vitest/coverage-v8, happy-dom) but those packages are not reflected by additional tests in the repo.
- CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs npm run test:ci (vitest with coverage) and references Playwright E2E steps, but no Playwright/e2e test files or Playwright config were found.
- Coverage run emitted many Vite source-map warnings about missing map files under config/dist (ENOENT index.d.ts.map...), which are noisy and may point to missing build artifacts or config issues.
- Large portions of project code in src/ are untested; current tests only exercise a small initialization path, explaining the very low line/statement coverage.

**Next Steps:**
- Add unit tests to cover more of the code in src/ (start with exported functions and common code paths) to raise lines/statements coverage.
- Address coverage failures: either increase test coverage to meet the 90% thresholds or revise the Vitest coverage thresholds to a realistic target for this project.
- Fix or suppress the Vite source-map warnings (generate missing .map files, exclude config/dist from instrumentation, or adjust Vite/Vitest config) so coverage runs are less noisy and reliable.
- If E2E testing is intended (CI references Playwright), add Playwright configuration and an e2e/ directory with tests, or remove Playwright steps from CI if not used.
- Add integration and accessibility tests leveraging axe-core / jest-axe and @testing-library to exercise behavior beyond simple unit tests and improve overall test quality.
- Make running tests and coverage part of contributor workflow (document commands and consider pre-commit/CI gating) so regressions are caught early.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (65% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Unit tests and basic runtime behavior work, and the code includes simple runtime error handling, but the build/dev workflow is not fully reproducible here due to missing or mismatched configuration files and an inability to start the dev server in this environment. Overall execution is functional for core pieces but the build pipeline needs fixes for reliable execution.
- Tests: `npm run test` executed vitest and reported 1 test passing (tests/main.test.ts).
- Runtime behavior: src/app.ts exposes init() which checks for the #app element and logs an error if missing; it renders expected content when present.
- Type-check/build: `npm run build` could not be completed in this environment; the tsc step references config/typescript/build.json which is missing, causing tsc to fail.
- Configuration mismatches: vite.config.ts references postcss.config.js while the repo contains postcss.config.ts (filename mismatch may break build tooling).
- Vitest config: root vitest.config.ts imports './config/testing/vitest-jsdom.js' which is missing, though tests succeeded using the config under config/vitest.config.ts—this indicates inconsistent config locations.
- Dev server: `npm run dev` failed here with a spawn/timeout error (ETIMEDOUT). Node (v22.17.1) and npm (10.9.2) are present and node_modules exists, so this may be an environment/permission issue but prevented runtime verification of the dev server.
- Repository contains some referenced config/setup files excluded by .gitignore or absent (e.g., config/testing/setup.js), which reduces reproducibility and increases fragility of the execution pipeline.

**Next Steps:**
- Add or restore missing TypeScript build config at config/typescript/build.json or modify tsconfig.build.json to not extend a missing file so `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` succeeds.
- Resolve vitest configuration inconsistencies: either provide ./config/testing/vitest-jsdom.js or simplify configs so tests use a single, present config file (e.g., config/vitest.config.ts).
- Fix Vite/PostCSS config filename mismatch: point vite.config.ts to postcss.config.ts or add a postcss.config.js that imports/loads the TypeScript config to ensure the build picks up PostCSS correctly.
- Re-run `npm run build` locally/CI after the above fixes and address any compiler/bundler errors. Add build verification to CI.
- Investigate and fix the dev server start failure in the execution environment (ETIMEDOUT). Verify `npm run dev` and `npm run preview` work locally and in CI smoke tests.
- Add CI job(s) that run type-check, build, and tests (for example run `npm run verify` in CI) to catch configuration and build regressions early.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (35% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is minimal and missing critical user-facing artifacts. There is no project README at the repository root, no docs/ or API documentation, and no changelog or release notes. Some inline comments and small README content exist (under assets), and tooling for linting/producing docs is present in package.json, but the actual documentation files and setup scripts referenced are missing or not present at the repo root.
- No README.md at repository root (checked: README.md does not exist).
- Only Markdown file found is assets/satoshi/README.md (font installation instructions) — not a project-level README.
- No docs/ directory or docs/*.md files found (package.json references docs/**/*.md for markdown linting, but directory is empty).
- No CHANGELOG or CHANGELOG.md or release notes present (search returned none).
- No API documentation or OpenAPI/spec files discovered.
- package.json contains doc-related scripts (docs:setup, docs:report) and markdown lint scripts referencing README.md and docs/**/*.md, but the setup script (setup-package-docs.js) was not found in the repository.
- Code contains minimal comments: src/app.ts and src/main.ts include short header comments, but there are no extensive docstrings or per-module documentation for public APIs.
- There are helpful configuration files present (e.g., .markdownlint.json, eslint configs, vitest config) indicating attention to quality/linting, but they do not substitute for project documentation.
- Tests run successfully (npm test executed Vitest; 1 test passed) — indicates code has some test coverage but no documented test or contribution guide.
- There are .voder files (.voder/history.md and .voder/last-action.md) but they are excluded by .gitignore/.voderignore and are not part of public docs.

**Next Steps:**
- Add a root README.md with: project overview, purpose, high-level architecture, setup and installation steps, how to run dev/build/test, and basic usage examples.
- Create a docs/ directory (or docs site) with more detailed guides: architecture/architecture.md, contributing.md, development setup, and testing guide.
- Add an API section (docs/api.md) or OpenAPI/typed API docs if the project exposes any programmatic API — document functions, public modules, and types.
- Introduce a changelog (CHANGELOG.md) and adopt a release-note workflow (e.g., Keep a CHANGELOG or use GitHub Releases).
- Ensure package.json scripts referencing docs and setup scripts are valid: add missing setup-package-docs.js or remove/adjust those scripts to match repo tooling.
- Expand inline documentation: add JSDoc/TSDoc comments to public functions and modules (e.g., export functions in src/), and ensure docstrings remain up to date with code changes.
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to help external contributors and include a LICENSE file if intended to be open sourced or clearly mark license status.
- Run markdown linting (npm run lint:md) after adding docs to ensure documentation adheres to the repo's markdown rules.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (80% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are declared and installed, npm audit reports no vulnerabilities, and tests run successfully. A small number of packages are outdated and several production dependencies appear unused in the current source — these are minor issues that should be cleaned up. Lockfile handling and automated update/vulnerability workflows could be improved.
- package.json exists and declares dependencies: @microsoft/clarity ^1.0.0, gsap ^3.13.0, three ^0.180.0 and a comprehensive set of devDependencies (eslint, vitest, typescript, vite, etc.).
- npm ls --depth=0 shows the packages are installed (output includes three, gsap, @microsoft/clarity, eslint, vitest, typescript, etc.).
- npm audit --json returned zero vulnerabilities (auditReportVersion 2; metadata shows 0 critical/high/moderate/low).
- Tests run: `npm run test` executed vitest and passed 1 test (vitest run, 1 passed).
- npx npm-check-updates --jsonUpgraded reported available upgrades for a few packages (notably @types/node -> ^24.3.1, eslint -> ^9.35.0, eslint-plugin-unicorn -> ^61.0.2, jest-axe -> ^10.0.0).
- Source files (src/main.ts, src/app.ts) do not import any external libraries — no references found to three, gsap, or clarity in source (indicates those prod dependencies may be unused in current code).
- A package-lock.json file appears to exist in the workspace but is excluded from read access in this environment (check_file_exists returned true while read_file was blocked by ignore rules), suggesting lockfile handling/commit status should be verified.

**Next Steps:**
- Verify whether prod dependencies (@microsoft/clarity, gsap, three) are required; remove or move to devDependencies if they are not used to minimize attack surface and bundle size.
- Commit and track a lockfile (package-lock.json or pnpm-lock.yaml) in version control, or document an intentional policy for not committing it — ensure CI uses reproducible installs.
- Run npm outdated (or integrate npm-check-updates) in CI to surface and regularly update out-of-date packages; consider automated dependency updates (Dependabot, Renovate) for minor/patch bumps.
- Add an automated dependency vulnerability check to CI (npm audit CI step, or Snyk/OSS Scan) to ensure regressions are caught on PRs.
- Address the reported package upgrades (e.g., @types/node, eslint-plugin-unicorn, jest-axe) and run the test/build pipeline to confirm compatibility before bumping.
- If prod dependencies are intentionally present but only used in runtime/browser (e.g., via external CDN injection), document their usage in README or comments to avoid confusion.
