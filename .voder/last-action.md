Plan execution checklist (from ##NOW and ##NEXT):
- Add daily schedule to security-audit workflow and generate SBOM after audit -> create/replace .github/workflows/security-audit.yml
- Add secret-scan workflow using gitleaks -> .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml
- Add CodeQL code-scanning workflow -> .github/workflows/code-scanning.yml
- Add Dependabot config -> .github/dependabot.yml
- Update SECURITY.md to document the scheduled scans/artifacts
- Run quality checks (format, lint, type-check, tests) and commit changes incrementally
- Push to remote

Actions I'll take (and did):
1. Create/modify the three new/updated GitHub workflow files and dependabot config.
2. Update SECURITY.md.
3. Run Prettier/lint/type-check/tests and fix any style issues required by pre-commit hooks.
4. Commit and push changes to the current branch.

Potential caveats discovered:
- Prettier config is a TypeScript file (prettier.config.ts) so running Prettier requires NODE_OPTIONS to allow the config to be executed. The repo already uses NODE_OPTIONS in package.json scripts; I used the same approach when needed.
- The gitleaks GitHub Action's exact outputs may vary; the job currently uploads artifacts and then attempts to fail if the action reports secrets. If you want a different failure policy (non-blocking initially), adjust the workflow conditionals.
- CodeQL requires repository and runner permissions; the workflow requests security-events write permission (included).
</scratchpad>

What I implemented
- Added/updated the following files (committed and pushed):
  - .github/workflows/security-audit.yml
    - Now runs on push, pull_request and daily schedule (02:00 UTC).
    - Runs npm audit, runs the repository's audit parser, attempts to generate an SBOM (CycloneDX via npx), and uploads audit + sbom artifacts.
  - .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml
    - Runs gitleaks (zricethezav/gitleaks-action@v2) on push/PR and daily schedule (03:00 UTC).
    - Uploads repo-secrets-scan artifacts.
  - .github/workflows/code-scanning.yml
    - CodeQL analysis workflow (init/autobuild/analyze) scheduled daily (04:00 UTC) and on PRs/push.
    - Uploads SARIF as artifact.
  - .github/dependabot.yml
    - Dependabot configured for npm weekly updates.
  - SECURITY.md
    - Appended documentation describing the new scheduled scans and which artifacts to expect.

Git history (key commits I created and pushed)
- ci(deps): add Dependabot configuration for weekly npm updates
- ci(security): add CodeQL code scanning workflow (daily & PRs)
- ci(security): add secret scanning workflow using gitleaks (daily & PRs)
- ci(security): add daily schedule and SBOM generation to security-audit workflow (create new file then remove old)
- docs(security): document scheduled scans and artifact locations in SECURITY.md

Quality and verification steps run (outputs summarized)
- Prettier (format check)
  - Command: npm run format:check
  - Result: All matched files use Prettier code style!
- ESLint (zero warnings allowed)
  - Command: npm run lint:check
  - Result: No warnings/errors reported (command completed).
- TypeScript type-check
  - Command: npm run type-check
  - Result: Completed (no errors).
- Tests (Vitest)
  - Command: npm test
  - Result: 14 tests passed (4 test files).
- CI-style test & coverage run
  - Command: npm run test:ci
  - Result: 14 tests passed; coverage summary shows 100% for app.ts / main.ts.
- Health-check
  - Command: npm run health-check
  - Result: All health-check steps passed (type-check, eslint, prettier).

Repository status
- Branch: fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage (same branch you were on)
- All created/modified files were committed and pushed to remote. Working tree is clean.

Notes, caveats and next steps I recommend
1. Verify workflows in GitHub Actions UI
   - The workflows are added to the repo and will run on the configured triggers (push/PR/schedule). Review the run logs in Actions to confirm the audit parser and SBOM generation behave as expected.
2. Secret-scan behavior
   - The gitleaks action uploads artifacts; adjust the fail condition if you want the scan non-blocking initially (tune rules and false positives) or make it fully blocking once tuned.
3. CodeQL
   - CodeQL results will also be uploaded as artifacts. If you want SARIF integrated into GitHub code scanning alerts, GitHub's codeql-action analyze step normally adds findings to the Security UI if the repository has code scanning enabled — you may need to enable GitHub Advanced Security/code-scanning or similar (GitHub will display CodeQL results if enabled).
4. Branch protection / required checks
   - After merging these workflows to your main branch, consider enabling branch protection that requires these security checks (or their contexts) to succeed before merging.
5. SBOM
   - I attempted to use the CycloneDX CLI via npx; the workflow step is tolerant (it won't fail the job if the npx tool can't run). If you want mandatory SBOM generation, remove the fallback `|| true` and pin the cyclonedx-bom package in devDependencies or add a preinstall step to ensure it's available in CI.
6. Follow-up improvements
   - Tuning gitleaks rules to reduce false positives.
   - Add Dependabot grouping and security-only rules if needed (I added a minimal weekly config).
   - Optionally add an artifact-forwarding step or automated triage (Slack/issue creation) when high/critical issues are detected.

If you'd like, next I can:
- Open a PR targeting main with these changes (if you prefer review before merge).
- Tweak the secret-scan to be non-blocking initially or tune gitleaks patterns.
- Make SBOM generation mandatory and add more SBOM metadata (include devDeps etc).
- Add a simple GitHub status-check mapping instruction for branch protection (I can produce the exact `gh api` command to set required checks once you confirm the set of checks to require).

Would you like me to open a PR for these changes or proceed to make any of the recommended follow-ups now?
