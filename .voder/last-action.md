Plan recap (NOW + NEXT):
- NOW: Replace implicit sleeps/waits in tests/e2e with explicit waits (done for tests/e2e/app.spec.ts).
- NOW: Add a non-interactive CI verification step after run-e2e.sh that validates e2e-stability.json (stats.total>0 OR artifacts non-empty), dumps preview.out on failure, and returns non-zero (implemented as scripts/verify-e2e.sh).
- NEXT: Run e2e locally against a preview server, iterate on failures; integrate verifier into run-e2e.sh and the GitHub workflow (done).
- Also: keep changes small, test frequently, commit regularly.

What I implemented (concrete changes)
- tests/e2e/app.spec.ts
  - Replaced the implicit assumption about readiness with an explicit wait:
    - await page.waitForSelector('#app', { state: 'visible', timeout: 10000 });
  - This makes the test deterministic vs relying on page.goto only.

- scripts/verify-e2e.sh (new)
  - Non-interactive verifier script that:
    - Reads e2e-stability.json
    - Checks stats.total > 0 OR artifacts.length > 0
    - If no tests/artifacts, dumps last 200 lines of preview.out (if present) and exits non-zero
  - Intended to be run after run-e2e.sh (locally or in CI) to mark preview/test-start failures.

- scripts/run-e2e.sh (modified)
  - Made portable (avoid problematic nohup usage) and now:
    - Starts preview server in background (when needed)
    - Runs Playwright tests (collects test-results)
    - Generates e2e-stability.json via .github/scripts/generate-e2e-stability-summary.js
    - Runs scripts/verify-e2e.sh and prefers returning:
      - Playwright exit code if tests actually failed,
      - Otherwise, the verifier exit code if Playwright exited 0 but verifier detected no tests/artifacts,
      - Otherwise 0.
    - Dumps preview logs for diagnostics when verifier fails.

- .github/workflows/e2e-stability.yml (modified)
  - Added a workflow step that runs the verifier:
      - name: Verify E2E stability artifacts
        if: always()
        run: |
          bash scripts/verify-e2e.sh
  - This will cause the nightly e2e-stability workflow to fail when no tests/artifacts were produced (so preview/startup issues are surfaced).

Quality checks & commands I ran
- npm test
  - Ran the vitest unit tests (before/after changes). Example earlier output:
    - Test Files 4 passed (4), Tests 14 passed (14)
- npm run build
  - Vite build succeeded (dist produced).
- Started preview in background in a portable way (npm run preview > preview.out 2>&1 & echo $! > preview.pid)
  - Note: In this execution environment launching the Playwright browsers and running the headless playwright test run timed out / was limited (ETIMEDOUT); see the Issues section below.

Commits created (incremental, descriptive)
- test(e2e): add explicit wait for #app to reduce flakiness
- ci(e2e): add verifier script to validate e2e-stability artifacts and dump preview logs on failure
- ci(e2e): run verifier after generating stability summary and prefer its result when Playwright reported no tests
- ci(e2e): add verification step to e2e-stability workflow to fail when no tests/artifacts produced
- ci(e2e): make run-e2e.sh portable and run verifier to catch missing tests/artifacts
- chore: update generated scripts and e2e verifier
(All changes were staged and committed incrementally and pushed.)

Files changed/added
- Modified: tests/e2e/app.spec.ts
- Added: scripts/verify-e2e.sh
- Modified: scripts/run-e2e.sh
- Modified: .github/workflows/e2e-stability.yml

How to run & reproduce locally
1. Ensure Node >= 22.17.0 and npm installed.
2. Install deps:
   - npm ci
3. If you want to run the whole sequence (build + preview + playwright + verifier):
   - npm run build
   - bash scripts/run-e2e.sh
     - This script will:
       - install Playwright browsers (npx playwright install --with-deps),
       - start a preview server (if none present),
       - run Playwright tests and write artifacts to test-results/,
       - generate e2e-stability.json via .github/scripts/generate-e2e-stability-summary.js,
       - run scripts/verify-e2e.sh and exit non-zero if preview/test startup failed or no tests ran.
4. You can also run Playwright directly:
   - npx playwright install --with-deps
   - npx playwright test --reporter=json --output=test-results/
   - node .github/scripts/generate-e2e-stability-summary.js
   - bash scripts/verify-e2e.sh

What the verifier does (summary)
- Reads e2e-stability.json and checks:
  - stats.total > 0 OR artifacts.length > 0
- If neither is true:
  - Prints a short diagnostic and dumps preview.out (last 200 lines if present)
  - Exits non-zero so CI can fail early on startup/preview issues (distinct from test assertion failures)

Limitations & issues encountered in this environment
- I attempted to run the full Playwright flow inside this execution environment, but long-running background processes and Playwright browser installs hit environment/timeout limits (spawn/ETIMEDOUT and similar). That prevented me from completing a local Playwright run end-to-end here.
- Commands that succeeded: unit tests, build, edits and commits. Commands that timed out/failed due to environment constraints: npx playwright install (may hang/download), npx playwright test (requires browsers).
- The changes are nevertheless safe and designed to run in CI or in a normal developer environment where Playwright browsers can be installed.

Recommended next steps for maintainers
- On your machine or CI runner:
  - Run: npm ci
  - Run: npm run build
  - Run: bash scripts/run-e2e.sh
  - Inspect test-results/, preview.out, and e2e-stability.json if verifier fails.
- If e2e still appears flaky:
  - Add explicit waits (like the one added) to other e2e tests.
  - Use Playwright trace/screenshot/video artifacts (already configured in playwright.config.ts: trace 'on-first-retry', screenshot 'only-on-failure', video 'retain-on-failure') to triage flakiness.
  - If some tests are inherently flaky, add conservative test-level retries (but prefer to fix the root cause).
- CI integration:
  - The GitHub Actions workflow .github/workflows/e2e-stability.yml now includes the verifier step and will mark runs as failed when no tests/artifacts are produced. This should surface preview/startup problems in the nightly stability job.

If you want I can:
- Attempt to run Playwright e2e locally here if you permit me to try installing browsers (may hit environment network/time limits).
- Add more deterministic waits to further tests if you point me at any e2e specs you want hardened.
- Add a short docs snippet to docs/E2E-REPRO.md showing the reproduce steps and how to interpret artifacts (I can create this file and commit it).

Summary: I implemented the NOW changes (explicit wait in the e2e spec) and the NEXT verification changes (scripts/verify-e2e.sh, updated run-e2e.sh, and added verification step in the GitHub Actions workflow). Unit tests and build ran successfully here; Playwright browser install + full test run requires a normal dev/CI environment to complete.
