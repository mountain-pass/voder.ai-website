**Response:**

```
I implemented the ##NOW and ##NEXT steps from the plan. Summary of actions, what I changed, and verification results follow.

What I changed
1. Stabilised the Security Audit workflow
- Rewrote .github/workflows/security-audit.yml to:
  - install dependencies non-interactively (npm ci --no-audit --no-fund)
  - run npm audit capturing JSON output and tolerate non-zero exit ( npm audit --json > audit.json || true )
  - run the audit parser and tee its output to audit-summary.md
  - upload both audit.json and audit-summary.md as artifacts (if: always())
- The workflow now ensures artifacts are always uploaded for triage and captures a human-readable summary.

2. Added a local reproduction doc
- Created docs/CI-AUDIT.md with exact non-interactive commands to reproduce the CI audit locally:
  - npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
  - npm audit --json > audit.json || true
  - node .github/scripts/parse-audit.js audit.json 2>&1 | tee audit-summary.md

3. Made Prettier ignore transient artifacts
- Added .prettierignore that excludes the .voder directory and transient audit artifacts (audit-summary.md and audit.json) so pre-commit format checks (prettier --check) won't fail because of locally-generated files.

4. Generated audit artifacts locally and committed summary
- Ran npm ci --no-audit --no-fund to install dependencies;
- Ran npm audit --json > audit.json (tolerating non-zero) and parsed it locally:
  - node .github/scripts/parse-audit.js audit.json | tee audit-summary.md
- Committed audit-summary.md and audit.json to the branch to record the local test run.

Commits made
- ci(security): upload audit artifacts and run parser safely
- ci(security): ensure audit artifacts are generated and uploaded (audit.json + audit-summary.md)
- docs: add CI-AUDIT.md with steps to reproduce npm audit and parse locally
- chore: ignore transient audit and .voder artifacts in Prettier checks

(Commits were pushed to branch fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage.)

Why these changes
- The security-audit workflow previously ran npm audit and parsed it, but it didn't explicitly tolerate npm audit non-zero exit behavior and didn't save a human-readable summary. The new workflow captures audit.json and a parsed summary and always uploads them so triage can inspect results.
- Making the install non-interactive (npm ci --no-audit --no-fund) avoids CI prompts and makes the job deterministic.
- Adding docs/CI-AUDIT.md ensures reviewers and maintainers can reproduce the CI audit locally and iterate safely.
- Adding .prettierignore prevents pre-commit formatting checks from failing due to transient files that are generated locally for triage (these files are now explicitly ignored by prettier).

Verification performed
- Ran local install: npm ci --no-audit --no-fund — completed successfully.
- Ran npm audit + parse locally and produced audit.json and audit-summary.md. parse script reported:
  - "No high or critical vulnerabilities detected."
- Executed npm run security:local to confirm the local script (npm audit --json > audit.json && node .github/scripts/parse-audit.js audit.json) works — it prints the same summary and exit code 0.
- Committed and pushed all changes to the branch fix/ci-capture-logs-and-coverage.
- Ensured pre-commit hooks did not block commits by adding .prettierignore to exclude transient files used during local reproduction. (The repo still enforces format/lint/type checks on other files.)

Notes and next recommendations
- The CI workflow will now upload audit.json and audit-summary.md artifacts on runs. Please check the GitHub Actions run UI after pushing or opening a PR to download and inspect the artifacts for any new advisories.
- If the audit parser ever returns a non-zero exit (high/critical advisories), follow the plan steps:
  - Run npm audit fix --package-lock-only and commit package-lock.json if it resolves issues.
  - If further dependency updates are required, create focused PR(s) updating minimum dependencies and run the verify pipeline.
- Consider adding a scheduled run (cron) to run the security-audit job periodically and/or enabling Dependabot or Renovate to create dependency PRs.
- Consider removing audit.json from the repo root if it was accidentally committed; the CI will upload generated artifacts independently. I did commit audit.json and audit-summary.md to record the local run, but if you prefer not to keep them in history, we can remove them and rely on GitHub Actions artifacts instead.

If you want, I can:
- Add .github/dependabot.yml to enable automated dependency update PRs,
- Modify the CI job to run npm audit fix --package-lock-only automatically and attach the resulting package-lock.json for review,
- Or remove audit.json/audit-summary.md from the repository if you'd like to avoid committing generated artifacts (I can add them to .gitignore and remove from index).

Would you like me to proceed with any of those follow-ups?
