Used tool: modify_file with input: {"filePath":"scripts/prepare-libraries.js","instruction":"Replace the entire file contents with a refactored implementation that exports an async function prepareLibraries(root = process.cwd()) and only runs when the script is executed directly. The function should perform the same behavior as the original script but avoid calling process.exit; instead it should return an object summary containing created, skipped, errors and counts. Ensure the CLI invocation runs the function and exits with non-zero code on errors. Use ESM imports and fileURLToPath to detect direct execution. Preserve logging behavior but make it non-fatal inside the function."}
Used tool: modify_file with input: {"filePath":"scripts/prepare-libraries.js","instruction":"Replace the file contents with a refactored ESM module that exports an async function prepareLibraries(root = process.cwd()) and only runs when executed directly. The function should perform the same behavior as the original script but should not call process.exit; instead it should return an object { created, skipped, errors, counts }. Preserve logging using console.log/console.warn/console.error. When run as a CLI (i.e., if executed directly), call prepareLibraries() and exit with non-zero code if errors were returned. Use import { fileURLToPath } from 'url' to detect direct execution. Ensure no prompts or interactive behavior."}
