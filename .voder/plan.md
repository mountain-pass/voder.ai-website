# Development Plan

## NOW

**Implement Basic Deployment Health Checks with Simple Rollback**

Add comprehensive HTTP health checks to the deployment workflow that verify the deployed site is actually working. Start with the simplest implementation:

1. **Extend the "Verify Deployment" step** in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
   - Replace the basic `netlify status` check with actual HTTP requests to the deployment URL
   - Add curl-based health checks that verify:
     - Site returns HTTP 200 status
     - Response time is reasonable (<5 seconds)
     - Basic HTML content is present (title tag exists)
   - Run checks for 2 minutes with 10-second intervals (12 total checks)

2. **Add Simple Rollback Mechanism**:
   - If health checks fail, use Netlify CLI to get the previous deployment
   - Promote the previous deployment to make it current
   - Verify the rolled-back deployment is healthy
   - Complete rollback within 60 seconds of failure detection

3. **Improve Status Reporting**:
   - Clear GitHub Actions output showing which health checks pass/fail
   - Specific error messages when rollback is triggered
   - Success confirmation when deployment is verified

This addresses the critical blocking issue (story 024.0) with the minimum viable implementation.

## NEXT

**Complete Deployment Verification Features**

After the basic health checks and rollback are working:

1. **Add Manual Override Capability**:
   - Environment variable `SKIP_AUTO_ROLLBACK=true` to disable rollback
   - Workflow dispatch input for manual control
   - Clear documentation for override procedures

2. **Enhance Health Checks**:
   - SSL certificate validation
   - Critical asset loading verification (CSS, JS files)
   - Basic functionality smoke tests (form exists, navigation works)

3. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Handle cases where rollback itself fails
   - Better error messages and debugging information
   - Notification improvements for deployment status

4. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Parallel health checks where possible
   - Faster rollback mechanisms
   - More efficient previous deployment detection

## LATER

**Complete Remaining Story Implementations**

After deployment verification is fully working, implement other missing features:

1. **Complete Quality Gates Enhancement** (story 023.0):
   - Add any missing pre-deployment checks
   - Improve quality gate reporting and feedback

2. **Implement Missing Development Stories**:
   - Any incomplete linting, testing, or build optimizations
   - Missing analytics implementations
   - Incomplete accessibility features

3. **Enhance User Experience Features**:
   - Complete business/brand stories if needed
   - Optimize performance and loading times
   - Add any missing interactive elements

4. **Infrastructure Improvements**:
   - Monitoring and alerting enhancements
   - Additional deployment environments if needed
   - Performance optimization and caching strategies

*This plan follows Gall's Law: starting with the simplest health check system that could work (HTTP status + basic rollback), then evolving it into a comprehensive deployment verification system.*
