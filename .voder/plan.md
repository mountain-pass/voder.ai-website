# Implementation Plan: Complete Story 026.1-DEV-3D-PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION

## NOW

**Implement automatic device-based performance optimization for 3D cube caustics**

Replace the current simple feature flag (`ENABLE_RAYMARCHING_CAUSTICS = false`) with an intelligent device detection system that automatically optimizes raymarching complexity based on device capabilities.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Add URL parameter support for performance override**: 
   - Parse URL parameters `?performance=true/false` for testing and debugging
   - Allow manual override of automatic device detection

2. **Implement device-specific caustics configuration**:
   - Mobile devices: 10 raymarching steps + reduced density
   - Tablet devices: 20 raymarching steps + moderate density  
   - Desktop devices: 40 raymarching steps + full density (current quality)
   - Use existing `getDeviceType()` method for device detection

3. **Update caustics creation logic**:
   - Replace hardcoded `ENABLE_RAYMARCHING_CAUSTICS = false` with device-based logic
   - Apply device-specific shader uniform values (uSteps, uDensity)
   - Maintain visual quality preservation for desktop while optimizing mobile

4. **Enable performance tests**:
   - Remove test skips in `tests/e2e/3d-cube-performance.spec.ts`
   - Update tests to validate device-specific performance budgets
   - Ensure Mobile Chrome tests pass within 15-second budget

5. **Add basic monitoring**:
   - Console log device type and performance mode selection
   - Track which optimization level is applied per session

## NEXT

**Enhance device capability detection and graceful degradation**

1. **Implement GPU capability assessment**:
   - Detect WebGL2 support and extensions
   - Check available GPU memory and renderer information
   - Use WebGL context to assess device performance characteristics

2. **Add graceful degradation logic**:
   - Fallback to 2D animation for very low-performance devices
   - Detect when 3D optimization isn't sufficient based on frame rate
   - Implement automatic downgrade if performance budget is exceeded

3. **Improve responsive configuration**:
   - Update `getResponsiveConfig()` method to return device-specific camera and FOV settings
   - Optimize camera positioning for mobile/tablet viewports
   - Ensure responsive behavior works correctly with performance optimization

4. **Remove legacy workaround dependencies**:
   - Eliminate the need for manual PERFORMANCE_MODE environment variable
   - Clean up any remaining hardcoded performance flags
   - Update documentation to reflect automatic optimization

## LATER

**Advanced performance monitoring and analytics integration**

1. **Implement comprehensive performance metrics**:
   - Track actual frame rates and rendering performance
   - Monitor GPU utilization and memory usage
   - Collect performance data across different device types

2. **Enhance analytics integration**:
   - Report performance mode selection to analytics system
   - Track user engagement with different optimization levels
   - Monitor performance impact on user interaction metrics

3. **Optimize shader complexity further**:
   - Implement adaptive quality based on real-time performance
   - Add dynamic LOD (Level of Detail) for caustics effects
   - Research additional mobile GPU optimizations

4. **Cross-browser performance testing**:
   - Validate performance across Safari, Firefox, and Edge
   - Test on actual mobile devices vs. emulation
   - Optimize for specific GPU architectures (Mali, Adreno, PowerVR)
