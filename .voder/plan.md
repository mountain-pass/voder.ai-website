# Implementation Plan

Based on the assessment findings, we need to resolve dependency issues to complete the project implementation.

## NOW

Upgrade @playwright/test from 1.55.1 to 1.56.0 as this is a mature package (9 days old) that passed the Smart Version Selection Algorithm. This is the only critical dependency upgrade identified that meets our upgrade criteria.

- Run `npm update @playwright/test` to upgrade to version 1.56.0
- Verify the upgrade completed successfully by checking package.json and package-lock.json
- Run the test suite to ensure compatibility with the new version
- Update any test files if needed for the new version

## NEXT

Analyze the remaining outdated dependencies using the Smart Version Selection Algorithm:

- Check release dates for @types/node (24.6.2 → 24.7.2)
- Check release dates for @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin (8.46.0 → 8.46.1)
- Check release dates for @typescript-eslint/parser (8.46.0 → 8.46.1)  
- Check release dates for axe-core (4.10.3 → 4.11.0)
- Apply the 7-day maturity threshold rule to determine which upgrades are safe
- Implement upgrades for any packages that meet the mature criteria
- Run full test suite after all approved dependency upgrades

## LATER

Monitor and maintain dependency health:

- Set up automated dependency monitoring for future updates
- Continue applying Smart Version Selection Algorithm for future upgrade decisions
- Monitor security advisories for any critical vulnerabilities that might override the 7-day rule
- Consider implementing automated dependency update workflows with proper testing gates
