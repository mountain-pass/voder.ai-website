Based on the assessment report findings, this plan addresses critical documentation inconsistencies that block reliable development environment setup.



## NOW## NOW



**Fix Node.js version documentation inconsistencies across all documentation files**



The assessment identified that package.json requires Node.js >=20.0.0 but multiple documentation files incorrectly state >=22.17.0, creating a blocking condition for new developers. This was caused by an October 3, 2025 commit that lowered the requirement for CI compatibility but didn't update documentation.**Fix Documentation Mismatch - README.md Script Reference**Fix the Mobile Chrome E2E test failure for "Brand Entry - desktop (1920x1080)" caused by race condition in 3D animation initialization.



**Required changes**:

1. Update README.md: Change "Node.js >= 22.17.0" to "Node.js >= 20.0.0"

2. Update docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md: Change prerequisites from >=22.17.0 to >=20.0.0The assessment identified a critical documentation issue: README.md references a non-existent `npm run health-check` script that was removed from package.json in recent updates.

3. Update prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/002.0-DEV-ENV-NODE.md: Change REQ-NODE-VERSION from >=22.17.0 to >=20.0.0

4. Verify that ADR-0004 (TypeScript config decision) aligns with Node.js 20.0.0 requirement



This resolves the critical documentation validation failure and enables reliable developer onboarding.**Implementation Steps:****Root Cause Analysis**: ## NOW



## NEXT1. Review the referenced script in README.md line 57



**Verify documentation consistency and complete remaining assessment phases**2. Determine if the script should be:- The test expects a canvas element to be visible when `hasCanvas` is true



After fixing the Node.js version documentation:   - Removed from documentation (if no longer needed)

1. Re-run documentation validation to ensure all inconsistencies are resolved

2. Continue with assessment Phases 5-10 (Testing, Runtime, Version Control, Pipeline, Problems, Traceability)   - Added back to package.json (if functionality is still required)- However, Mobile Chrome's performance monitoring is inconsistently disabling 3D animation

3. Generate final assessment report confirming project readiness

3. Update README.md to remove the invalid reference

## LATER

4. Verify all other npm script references in README.md match package.json- The animation system decides between canvas (3D) and fallback (2D) based on performance metrics

**Monitor for future documentation drift**

5. Check DEVELOPER-SETUP.md for any similar outdated references

1. Add documentation consistency checks to pre-commit hooks

2. Consider automated validation of version requirements across documentation files- Race condition exists between performance monitoring completion and test assertion**Fix Problem 011 Status Inconsistency**: Update the status of problem `011-missing-e2e-tests-in-ci-pipeline.open.md` from "OPEN" to "CLOSED" since the resolution section clearly documents that E2E tests are already properly integrated in the CI pipeline. The problem was based on an incorrect assumption and the investigation findings show:## NOW## NOW

3. Review CI/CD pipeline to ensure Node.js version alignment between runtime and documentation
**Rationale:** Documentation accuracy is essential for contributor onboarding and maintains trust in project setup instructions. This is blocking new story development per assessment criteria.



## NEXT

**Immediate Fix**: Update the test logic in `tests/e2e/screenshots.spec.ts` to handle the case where performance monitoring disables the 3D animation after canvas creation but before visibility check. The test should accept either canvas OR fallback as valid states, not enforce canvas visibility when `hasCanvas` is true but performance monitoring has kicked in.

**Verify Complete Documentation Currency**



After fixing the immediate health-check script issue:

**Implementation**:1. Pre-deployment E2E validation exists (`npm run e2e:ci` in quality gates job)

1. Cross-reference all npm scripts mentioned in documentation with actual package.json

2. Update any other stale documentation references discovered1. Modify the assertion logic in the Brand Entry test to be more flexible

3. Ensure setup instructions remain accurate for new contributors

4. Verify that the verify script mentioned in README actually works as documented2. Change from strict canvas visibility requirement to accepting either animation state2. CI configuration includes Playwright dependencies installation



**Note:** This addresses the documentation validation failure that triggered the assessment fail-fast condition.3. Add proper timing buffer for performance monitoring to complete before checking animation state



## LATER4. Update test to validate animation container exists rather than specific canvas visibility3. Post-deployment validation is implemented (`npm run e2e:ci:prod`)Fix the 3 critical E2E test failures that are blocking development:Implement **Targeted Post-Deployment** validation to achieve the "Post-deployment validation uses single browser (Chromium) with minimal essential tests only" acceptance criteria.



**Establish Documentation Maintenance Process**



Future work to prevent documentation drift:## NEXT4. E2E test failures properly block deployment through job dependencies



1. Add documentation review to pre-commit hooks or CI pipeline

2. Create automated checks that validate npm script references in markdown files

3. Establish regular documentation review cycles aligned with dependency updatesAdd performance monitoring stabilization to prevent future test flakiness:

4. Consider adding documentation update requirements to story completion criteria

1. Increase the stabilization wait time in screenshot tests from 4000ms to 6000ms

**Note:** These are process improvements to prevent future documentation staleness issues.
2. Add performance override parameter to force 3D mode in tests when neededThis is a simple status update to align the file status with the documented resolution, removing a false blocking issue from the project.

3. Create helper function to wait for animation state to stabilize before assertions

### Fix 1: Mobile Cube Resize Test Timeout**Current Issue**: Post-deployment validation is running a comprehensive E2E suite (10m10s runtime) instead of minimal smoke tests.

## LATER

## NEXT

Consider architectural improvements to the 3D animation system:

1. Make performance monitoring decisions more deterministic for testing**Problem**: `[chromium] › Mobile 3D Cube Size Jump Prevention › should not change cube size on mobile scroll` - Test timeout (30000ms exceeded) with canvas locator timeout during mobile scroll testing.

2. Add explicit test mode that bypasses performance monitoring

3. Improve performance monitoring algorithm to be less sensitive to CI environment variations**Address Problem 012 - CI Pipeline Performance Optimization**: Implement targeted optimizations for the slow CI/CD deployment pipeline that's taking 40-75 minutes instead of the target 5-15 minutes. Based on the problem analysis, focus on:

4. Consider splitting canvas creation from performance monitoring to reduce race conditions
**Action Required**: 

1. **E2E Test Suite Optimization**: The problem indicates E2E tests are the primary bottleneck. Optimize Playwright configuration:

   - Review and optimize browser configurations (currently running on Chromium, WebKit, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari)**Root Cause Analysis**: The test is trying to locate a canvas element that may not be rendered or visible in the mobile viewport during scroll operations. The 3D animation may be disabled due to performance concerns on mobile, making the canvas unavailable.1. Create a separate, minimal smoke test suite for post-deployment validation

   - Optimize wait strategies to replace inefficient `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` patterns

   - Remove or reduce fixed timeout calls (`waitForTimeout()`)2. Focus on essential functionality only: page loads, form exists, no JavaScript errors

   - Implement test parallelization improvements

**Implementation**:3. Run on Chromium only (no cross-browser testing in post-deployment)

2. **Pipeline Job Optimization**: Review `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to identify other potential bottlenecks beyond E2E testing

1. Add conditional logic to check if 3D animation is enabled before testing canvas interactions4. Target <2 minute execution time vs current 10+ minutes

3. **Selective Test Execution**: Consider implementing smart test selection for deployment gates vs. full test suites

2. Update the test to handle the case where 3D animation is disabled on mobile due to performance

## LATER

3. Add proper wait conditions for canvas element availability## NEXT

**Performance Monitoring and Continuous Improvement**: After the immediate pipeline optimization:

4. Increase timeout or add retry logic for mobile-specific scenarios

1. **Pipeline Metrics Dashboard**: Implement monitoring for CI/CD pipeline performance to track DORA metrics and prevent regression

2. **Advanced Test Optimization**: Further optimize 3D WebGL performance tests and visual regression testingOptimize E2E test efficiency:

3. **Infrastructure Scaling**: Evaluate GitHub Actions runner configurations and potential for test sharding across multiple jobs

### Fix 2: WebKit Analytics Tracking Failure  1. **Replace waitForTimeout calls** - Remove inefficient `page.waitForTimeout(500)` calls throughout E2E suite and replace with proper element waits

**Note**: All assessment, validation, and traceability work has been completed. This plan focuses only on fixing the identified blocking problems to enable continued development velocity.
**Problem**: `[webkit] › bounce tracking is initialized correctly` - Traffic source tracking initialization failure with console message assertion failed.2. **Review test scope** - Ensure pre-deployment E2E tests focus on essential functionality for a landing page with contact form

3. **Implement parallel cross-browser testing** - Run focused E2E tests across browsers in parallel during main pipeline

**Root Cause Analysis**: WebKit browser environment may have different timing for analytics initialization or different console message formatting compared to Chromium.

## LATER

**Implementation**:

1. Review console message timing and format differences in WebKit**Performance Optimization**:

2. Add browser-specific wait conditions for analytics initialization- Implement intelligent test parallelization to reduce overall CI time

3. Update assertion to handle WebKit-specific console message patterns- Add test result caching for unchanged components

4. Ensure analytics script loading is complete before checking initialization- Optimize E2E test selector strategies for faster execution



### Fix 3: Mobile Safari Analytics Tracking Failure## NEXT

**Problem**: `[Mobile Safari] › bounce tracking is initialized correctly` - Traffic source tracking initialization failure with console message assertion failed.

After fixing the immediate test failure:

**Root Cause Analysis**: Similar to WebKit but specifically for Mobile Safari environment, which may have additional mobile-specific behaviors or restrictions.

1. **Optimize E2E Test Performance**: The post-deployment tests are still taking 9+ minutes which is excessive for a simple landing page validation. The current approach runs too many comprehensive tests for post-deployment validation.

**Implementation**:

1. Add Mobile Safari-specific handling for analytics initialization2. **Replace waitForTimeout Calls**: Remove inefficient `page.waitForTimeout(500)` calls throughout the E2E test suite and replace with proper element waits to improve test reliability and speed.

2. Review if mobile browser restrictions affect analytics loading

3. Update test to account for mobile-specific timing differences3. **Implement Proper Test Scope**: Ensure post-deployment tests only validate critical functionality (page loads, form exists, no major JavaScript errors) rather than comprehensive cross-browser testing.

4. Ensure proper mobile viewport and device simulation

## LATER

## NEXT

Long-term improvements:

### Verify Cross-Browser Compatibility

- Run the fixed tests across all browsers (Chromium, WebKit, Mobile Safari) to ensure consistency1. **Separate Comprehensive Testing**: Move comprehensive cross-browser testing to a separate workflow that runs on a schedule rather than blocking deployments.

- Update any remaining browser-specific edge cases discovered during testing

- Ensure all 296 tests achieve 100% pass rate2. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement monitoring to ensure the optimized pipeline stays under 10 minutes total execution time.



### Performance Optimization Validation3. **Test Architecture Review**: Review the overall E2E testing strategy to ensure tests are appropriately scoped for different pipeline stages (pre-deployment critical tests vs post-deployment smoke tests vs comprehensive validation).
- Verify that the mobile cube resize fix doesn't impact 3D animation performance decisions
- Ensure analytics tracking works efficiently across all browser environments
- Confirm that test fixes don't introduce new performance regressions

## LATER
