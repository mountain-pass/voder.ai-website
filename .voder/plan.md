# Implementation Plan

## NOW

No implementation work required. Assessment complete with all phases passing.

**Current Status**: ✅ READY FOR NEXT STORY

The project has successfully completed comprehensive assessment across all 11 phases:
- Dependencies: Stable with Smart Version Selection (12 fresh packages deferred)
- Security: 2 DISPUTED CVEs (false positives, no actual risk)
- Code Quality: All checks passing (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- Testing: 227/227 tests passing (100% success rate, 86.05% coverage)
- Build: Production build successful (1.31s, optimized bundles)
- Documentation: 103 comprehensive markdown files
- Pipeline: CI/CD configured and operational
- Problems: No open blocking issues

**Next Action**: Pull new story from backlog and begin implementation

## NEXT

After pulling the next story from backlog:

1. Read story requirements from prompts/release-*/in-scope/
2. Create implementation approach based on requirements
3. Implement story with TDD approach (tests first)
4. Verify all acceptance criteria met
5. Run assessment to validate completion
6. Commit and push changes

## LATER

### Optional Optimizations (Future Consideration)

**Dependency Updates** (When Packages Mature):
- Oct 24: eslint, @eslint/js, @playwright/test (6 days → 7 days)
- Oct 25: jsdom (5 days → 7 days)
- Oct 27: @typescript-eslint packages (3 days → 7 days)
- Oct 28: @types/node, @axe-core/playwright (2 days → 7 days)
- Oct 29: happy-dom, vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, netlify-cli (1 day → 7 days)

**Bundle Size Optimization**:
- Consider code splitting if main bundle approaches 600KB
- Current: 508KB (129KB gzipped) with 74.6% compression
- Acceptable performance, optimization not urgent

**Major Version Upgrades** (Defer Until Mature + Migration Planning):
- vitest: 3.2.4 → 4.0.1 (major version, needs migration assessment)
- @vitest/coverage-v8: 3.2.4 → 4.0.1 (major version, coordinate with vitest)

### Security Monitoring

**Disputed CVE Tracking**:
- CVE-2025-57319 (fast-redact): Monitor for resolution or further updates
- Status: DISPUTED by maintainers, documented in security-incidents/
- No action required unless CVE status changes

**Regular Security Scans**:
- Continue npm audit in CI/CD pipeline
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities in dependency updates
- Follow Security Policy for vulnerability acceptance criteria

### Future Enhancements

**Performance Monitoring**:
- Establish baseline performance metrics
- Track bundle size over time
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in production

**Testing Enhancements**:
- Maintain 85%+ code coverage target
- Add more E2E scenarios as features grow
- Consider visual regression testing

**Documentation Maintenance**:
- Keep docs current with code changes
- Update ADRs as architecture evolves
- Document new patterns and practices
