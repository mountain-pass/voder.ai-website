# Implementation Plan# Implementation Plan



Based on the assessment results from October 1, 2025, the implementation is currently blocked by dependency issues that need immediate resolution.Based on the current assessment results showing blocked dependencies, this plan focuses on resolving the blocking issues to enable continued development.



## NOW## NOW



**Update and fix dependency management issues****Update all outdated dependencies to resolve blocking issues**



Update the outdated `netlify-cli` dependency and ensure proper package lock file management:The assessment identified 4 outdated dependencies that are preventing new story development:



1. Update netlify-cli from version 23.8.1 to 23.9.0 using `npm update netlify-cli`1. Update `@testing-library/jest-dom` from 6.8.0 to 6.9.0

2. Verify package-lock.json is generated/updated properly by running `npm install`2. Update `@types/node` from 24.6.0 to 24.6.1  

3. Test all npm scripts to ensure compatibility after updates:3. Update `jiti` from 2.6.0 to 2.6.1

   - Run `npm run build` to verify build still works4. Update `typescript` from 5.9.2 to 5.9.3

   - Run `npm run test:ci` to verify tests still pass

   - Run `npm run lint:check` to verify linting still worksRun `npm update` to update all dependencies to their latest versions, then verify the installation with `npm install` and run the full test suite to ensure compatibility.

   - Run `npm run format:check` to verify formatting still works

4. Commit the dependency updates and lock file changes## NEXT



This is the critical blocking issue preventing any further work on the project. The dependency issues must be resolved before any new features or improvements can be implemented.**Verify system stability after dependency updates**



## NEXT1. Run the complete quality check suite (`npm run verify`) to ensure all linting, formatting, building, and testing passes

2. Execute end-to-end tests to verify application functionality is maintained

After dependency issues are resolved, address any remaining build or runtime issues:3. Check that the development server still works correctly

4. Validate that the build process produces the expected output

1. Run the complete verification suite (`npm run verify`) to ensure all systems are working

2. Test the screenshot generation functionality that was previously failing (`npm run screenshots`)## LATER

3. Verify the production build and preview functionality works correctly

4. Ensure all git hooks and pre-commit checks are functioning properly**Resume normal development workflow**



## LATEROnce dependencies are updated and system stability is verified, normal development can resume including:



Future maintenance and improvements to keep the project healthy:1. Continue implementing any incomplete features from the current release

2. Address any technical debt that has accumulated

1. Implement automated dependency monitoring (renovate or dependabot) to prevent future outdated dependency issues3. Optimize performance based on analytics data

2. Schedule regular dependency update cycles as part of maintenance workflow4. Prepare for future feature development cycles
3. Consider upgrading to newer versions of major dependencies when stable versions are available
4. Review and optimize the npm scripts for better developer experience
5. Enhance the build and deployment pipeline for better reliability
