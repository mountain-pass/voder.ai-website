# Implementation Plan# Implementation Plan# Implementation Plan



Based on the assessment showing **BLOCKED BY DEPENDENCIES** status, this plan focuses on resolving the identified dependency issues to enable progress.



## NOWBased on the assessment that identified **BLOCKED BY DEPENDENCIES** status, this plan follows Gall's Law by starting with the simplest possible fix and follows ITIL problem management for systematic resolution.## NOW



**Update all outdated dependencies to their latest versions**



Update the 8 identified outdated packages using npm update, then run comprehensive testing to ensure compatibility:## NOW**Resolve P003: Coming Soon Button Overlapping 3D Cube (Priority 7 - High)**



1. **Update Dependencies**:

   ```bash

   npm update**Update Critical Dependencies to Unblock Development**Follow ITIL problem management process:

   ```



2. **Verify Build Still Works**:

   ```bashPerform a targeted dependency update focusing on security and stability fixes first:1. **Complete Root Cause Analysis** for P003

   npm run build

   ```   - Problem is already identified: CSS negative margin (`margin: 0 0 -100vh`) in `.hero-animation` pulls content up over the 3D canvas



3. **Run Full Test Suite**:1. **Update patch versions first** (lowest risk):   - The `hero-animation` div (3D canvas container) is positioned before the text content in HTML, but uses negative margin to overlay text on top

   ```bash

   npm run test:ci   ```bash   - Layout creates visual overlap where "Coming Soon" button appears directly over 3D cube

   ```

   npm update @eslint/js @playwright/test tsx vite

4. **Verify Code Quality Tools**:

   ```bash   ```2. **Create Failing Test** 

   npm run lint:check

   npm run format:check     - Write Playwright E2E test that verifies button and 3D cube don't overlap

   npm run type-check

   ```2. **Update TypeScript tooling** (development dependencies):   - Test should check z-index stacking and visual positioning



5. **Security Audit**:   ```bash   - Confirm test fails with current layout (reproduces the problem)

   ```bash

   npm audit   npm update @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser

   ```

   ```3. **Implement Targeted Workaround**

6. **End-to-End Testing**:

   ```bash   - Based on root cause: Adjust CSS layout to prevent overlap

   npm run test:e2e

   ```3. **Update build tools** (proven stable):   - Simple solution: Modify `.hero-animation` positioning to create proper separation



The specific packages to be updated:   ```bash   - Remove negative margin and adjust layout to position 3D cube as true background

- `@eslint/js`: 9.35.0 → 9.36.0

- `@types/node`: 22.18.1 → 22.18.7     npm update htmlhint jiti netlify-cli   - Ensure text content has proper vertical spacing above the 3D canvas

- `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`: 8.43.0 → 8.45.0

- `eslint`: 9.35.0 → 9.36.0   ```

- `eslint-plugin-unicorn`: 60.0.0 → 61.0.2

- `happy-dom`: 18.0.1 → 19.0.24. **Transition to Known Error Status**

- `jest-axe`: 9.0.0 → 10.0.0

- `jsdom`: 26.1.0 → 27.0.04. **Verify the updates work**:   - Move P003 from `.open.md` to `.known-error.md`



If any compatibility issues arise, investigate and fix them immediately before proceeding.   ```bash   - Document workaround implementation



## NEXT   npm run build   - Create INVEST-compliant story for permanent design solution



**Commit dependency updates and re-run full assessment**   npm run test:unit



After dependency updates are successfully tested:   npm run lint:check## NEXT



1. **Commit Changes**:   ```

   ```bash

   git add package.json package-lock.json**Clean Up Problem Management System**

   git commit -m "Update dependencies to latest versions

5. **Commit the working state**:

   - @eslint/js: 9.35.0 → 9.36.0

   - @types/node: 22.18.1 → 22.18.7   ```bash1. **Resolve Duplicate Problem Files**

   - @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin: 8.43.0 → 8.45.0

   - eslint: 9.35.0 → 9.36.0   git add package.json package-lock.json   - Remove duplicate `.open.md` files for problems already in `.known-error.md` status

   - eslint-plugin-unicorn: 60.0.0 → 61.0.2

   - happy-dom: 18.0.1 → 19.0.2   git commit -m "deps: update critical dependencies for security and stability"   - Keep only the `.known-error.md` versions for:

   - jest-axe: 9.0.0 → 10.0.0

   - jsdom: 26.1.0 → 27.0.0"   ```     - `mobile-3d-cube-size-jump-scroll.known-error.md` (delete .open.md)

   ```

     - `text-flash-before-3d-render.known-error.md` (delete .open.md)

2. **Push Changes**:

   ```bashThis provides the minimum viable dependency update to unblock development while maintaining system stability.   - Ensures single source of truth for problem status

   git push

   ```



3. **Re-run Complete Assessment**: Execute full assessment cycle to validate all phases now that dependencies are current## NEXT2. **Implement P003 Permanent Fix** 



## LATER   - Create proper design system for hero section layout



**Resume normal development workflow****Evaluate and Update Major Version Dependencies**   - Implement clean CSS Grid or Flexbox solution that naturally separates content



Once dependencies are updated and assessment passes:   - Replace hacky negative margin approach with intentional layout design



1. **Implement any remaining story requirements** identified during the complete assessmentAfter confirming the core system works with patch updates:   - Re-enable and verify P003 test passes

2. **Address any problems** found during problem assessment phase

3. **Begin next story development** if all requirements are met

1. **Research breaking changes** for major version updates:3. **Complete Project Quality Gates**

   - eslint-plugin-unicorn (60→61)   - Ensure all tests pass with layout fixes

   - happy-dom (18→19)    - Verify code coverage remains >80%

   - jest-axe (9→10)   - Confirm no new linting or formatting issues

   - jsdom (26→27)   - Validate responsive design across all device sizes



2. **Update one major dependency at a time**:## LATER

   ```bash

   npm update eslint-plugin-unicorn**Future Enhancements and Monitoring**

   npm run test:unit  # verify compatibility

   npm run lint:check  # verify linting still works1. **Design System Foundation**

   ```   - Establish consistent spacing and layout patterns

   - Create reusable CSS components for hero sections

3. **Fix any breaking changes** encountered:   - Document layout best practices to prevent similar issues

   - Update configuration files if needed

   - Adjust test code for API changes2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Update TypeScript types if required   - Monitor 3D animation performance metrics

   - Optimize Three.js initialization for faster load times

4. **Repeat for each major version update** with testing between each   - Consider progressive enhancement strategies



5. **Consider Node.js types update**:3. **User Experience Improvements**

   - Evaluate @types/node (22→24) compatibility with current Node.js version   - A/B test different button positions and styles

   - Update only if current Node.js supports the new types   - Analyze user engagement with coming soon CTA

   - Gather feedback on 3D animation effectiveness

## LATER

4. **Preventive Measures**

**System Optimization and Maintenance**   - Add automated visual regression testing

   - Implement design system governance

After all dependencies are current and stable:   - Create layout validation rules in CI/CD pipeline

1. **Consider npm update**:
   - Evaluate upgrading npm from 10.9.2 to 11.6.1
   - Test with development workflow first
   - Update globally if no compatibility issues

2. **Dependency audit and cleanup**:
   - Review unused dependencies
   - Consolidate duplicate functionality
   - Optimize bundle size

3. **Automated dependency monitoring**:
   - Set up automated dependency update PRs
   - Configure security vulnerability scanning
   - Establish regular dependency review schedule

4. **Documentation updates**:
   - Update development setup instructions
   - Document dependency update procedures
   - Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
