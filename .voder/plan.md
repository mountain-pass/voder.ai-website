# Implementation Plan

Based on the current assessment results showing blocked dependencies, this plan focuses on resolving the blocking issues to enable continued development.

## NOW

**Update all outdated dependencies to resolve blocking issues**

The assessment identified 4 outdated dependencies that are preventing new story development:

1. Update `@testing-library/jest-dom` from 6.8.0 to 6.9.0
2. Update `@types/node` from 24.6.0 to 24.6.1  
3. Update `jiti` from 2.6.0 to 2.6.1
4. Update `typescript` from 5.9.2 to 5.9.3

Run `npm update` to update all dependencies to their latest versions, then verify the installation with `npm install` and run the full test suite to ensure compatibility.

## NEXT

**Verify system stability after dependency updates**

1. Run the complete quality check suite (`npm run verify`) to ensure all linting, formatting, building, and testing passes
2. Execute end-to-end tests to verify application functionality is maintained
3. Check that the development server still works correctly
4. Validate that the build process produces the expected output

## LATER

**Resume normal development workflow**

Once dependencies are updated and system stability is verified, normal development can resume including:

1. Continue implementing any incomplete features from the current release
2. Address any technical debt that has accumulated
3. Optimize performance based on analytics data
4. Prepare for future feature development cycles
