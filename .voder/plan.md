# Implementation Plan# Implementation Plan# Implementation Plan---



Based on the current assessment, the project is blocked by formatting issues in the dependencies validation phase, and there are 2 open problems requiring root cause analysis and workarounds.



## NOWFollowing Gall's Law: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked."mode: agent



**Fix code formatting issues blocking dependency validation**



Run `npm run format` to automatically fix the formatting issues in `docs/history.md` and `index.html` that are causing the verify script to fail. This is blocking all progress as the dependency validation phase cannot complete successfully with failing quality gates.## NOW## NOW---



After formatting is fixed, commit the changes to ensure the working directory is clean for proper version control validation.



## NEXT**Root Cause Analysis for Text Flash Problem** - Conduct systematic investigation of why "Keep Shipping Fast" and "Coming Soon" text still flashes on page load despite CSS workaround attempts.



**Conduct root cause analysis for open problems (following ITIL process)**



Two open problems require systematic investigation:**Investigation Steps**:**Implement workaround for Text Flash Before 3D Render (Priority 9 - Critical)**Firstly, delete any existing #file:.voder/plan.md file to ensure a fresh plan.



1. **mobile-3d-cube-size-jump-scroll.open.md**: Analyze root cause of mobile 3D cube size jumping during scroll1. **5 Whys Analysis** - Why does text flash occur?

   - Use structured analysis techniques (5 Whys, timeline analysis)

   - Create failing Playwright test that reproduces the scroll jump behavior   - Why: Text is visible before CSS hides it

   - Design targeted workaround based on root cause (likely CSS/animation timing issue)

   - Consider feature disabling if root cause suggests architectural issues   - Why: CSS is loaded asynchronously by Vite 

   - Transition to known-error status once workaround implemented

   - Why: Critical CSS is not inlined in HTML headFollowing ITIL problem management process, implement the quickest, simplest workaround to eliminate the jarring text flash that affects 100% of users on first page load.Then create a new #file:.voder/plan.md based on what we should do to complete the implementation of the software project.

2. **text-flash-before-3d-render.open.md**: Analyze root cause of text flashing before 3D render

   - Investigate timing between text display and 3D scene initialization   - Why: We relied on external stylesheet loading timing

   - Create failing test that captures the flash behavior

   - Implement workaround (possibly CSS opacity/visibility controls or loading state management)   - Why: We didn't account for CSS loading delay vs HTML rendering

   - Transition to known-error status



Both problems should have workarounds implemented within 24 hours if they are Priority 6+ (High priority), with service stability prioritized over feature availability.

2. **Timeline Analysis** - Document exact sequence:### Workaround Strategy: Hide Text Content Initially (Option 1)Make sure you follow Gall's Law: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked."

## LATER

   - HTML loads and renders text immediately

**Create permanent fix stories for known-error problems**

   - Vite loads CSS asynchronously  This is the simplest implementation that could possibly work - pure CSS solution with minimal risk.

Once problems are transitioned to known-error status with implemented workarounds:

   - CSS applies opacity rules after brief delay

1. Create INVEST-compliant user stories for permanent fixes to the 3D cube and text rendering issues

2. Implement permanent solutions through normal development process   - JavaScript adds .js-loaded class laterSo, start with the simplest possible implementation that could possibly work, then iterate and improve it.

3. Remove workarounds and restore full functionality

4. Close resolved problems   - Text becomes visible again with transition



**Dependency updates****Implementation Steps:**



Address the outdated dependencies identified in the assessment:3. **Create Failing Test** - E2E Playwright test that:

- Update ESLint, TypeScript ESLint plugins, and other dev tools to latest versions

- Test compatibility and update any breaking changes   - Loads page with network throttling1. **Modify CSS** in `src/style.css`:**CRITICAL PROCESS REQUIREMENT**: For any open problems identified in the assessment, you MUST follow the ITIL problem management process as defined in #file:../../docs/PROBLEM-MANAGEMENT.md:

- Update Playwright, Vite, and other build tools

- Maintain compatibility with Node.js 22.17.0+ requirement   - Captures screenshot at initial load moment

   - Verifies text is NOT visible before .js-loaded class   - Add CSS rule to hide hero text content until 3D system is ready

   - Documents the exact timing issue

   - Use opacity transition for smooth loading experience1. **Implement workarounds FIRST** - You don't "fix" problems directly. You implement workarounds to mitigate impact immediately.

4. **Analyze Root Cause** - CSS loading timing issue where external stylesheets load after HTML renders, creating unavoidable flash window

   ```css2. **Then conduct root cause analysis** - Use structured techniques (5 Whys, fishbone, timeline analysis)

## NEXT

   .hero-title, .hero-description, .status-indicator {3. **Create failing tests** that reproduce the problem

**Implement Targeted Workaround Based on Root Cause** - Now that we understand the CSS loading timing issue, implement the correct solution:

     opacity: 0;4. **Transition problems to known-error status** when workaround is implemented and root cause identified

1. **Critical CSS Inline Solution** - Move essential opacity rules directly into HTML head to eliminate any loading delay

2. **Verify Workaround Effectiveness** - Test that inline critical CSS prevents flash completely       transition: opacity 0.3s ease;5. **Create INVEST-compliant stories** for permanent fixes

3. **Document Targeted Workaround** - Update problem documentation with root cause findings and targeted solution

4. **Transition to Known Error** - Move problem to known-error status with proper documentation   }6. **Finally implement permanent fixes** through normal development process



**Mobile Cube Size Jump Root Cause Analysis** - Apply same methodology to mobile scroll issue:   

1. **Device Detection Analysis** - Verify mobile detection is working correctly

2. **Resize Event Investigation** - Understand why resize events cause size jumps on mobile   .js-loaded .hero-title,Use the following the now-next-later template:

3. **Canvas/WebGL Behavior Study** - Document how mobile browsers handle WebGL canvas sizing

4. **Create Failing Mobile Test** - E2E test that reproduces mobile size jump issue   .js-loaded .hero-description, 



## LATER   .js-loaded .status-indicator {```



**Permanent Fix Implementation** - After root causes are fully understood and targeted workarounds are working:     opacity: 1;## NOW



1. **Create INVEST-compliant Stories** - For permanent fixes based on root cause analysis findings   }

2. **Optimize CSS Loading Strategy** - Implement proper critical CSS extraction for production builds  

3. **Mobile WebGL Optimization** - Permanent solution for mobile canvas handling based on root cause findings   ```The single action to do now - detailed

4. **Performance Monitoring** - Add monitoring to detect similar timing and mobile rendering issues in the future



**Process Improvement** - Enhance problem management workflow based on lessons learned from first implementation cycle.
2. **Verify workaround** - Test that:## NEXT

   - No text flash occurs on page load

   - Text appears smoothly after 3D system initializesThe actions to take, if any, after the action in the "NOW" section - less detailed. This MUST not contain story validation, acceptance criteria validation, traceability work, or assessment work - only actual implementation work to fix issues and complete the project.

   - Fallback works when JavaScript is disabled (progressive enhancement)

## LATER

3. **Document workaround** in the problem file:

   - Implementation steps and files modifiedThe actions to take, if any, after we've done everything in "Now" and "Next" - Future work - high level. This MUST not contain story validation, acceptance criteria validation, traceability work, or assessment work - only actual implementation work to fix issues and complete the project.

   - Limitations (blank space during loading)```

   - Business impact (improved first impression)

   - Rollback procedure (remove CSS rules)**CRITICAL**: Do not plan to do further assessments, traceability, or validation work - we are done with those. The plan should only contain actual implementation work to fix issues and complete the project. No acceptance criteria validation, no story validation, no assessment work should be included in the plan.


**Success Criteria:**
- Text content does not appear before 3D cube renders
- Smooth opacity transition when content appears
- No layout shifts during loading
- Works across all browsers and devices

## NEXT

**Implement workaround for Mobile 3D Cube Size Jump on Scroll (Priority 6 - High)**

Following ITIL process, implement feature-disabling workaround as the safest approach for this complex mobile viewport issue.

### Workaround Strategy: Disable Resize Handling on Mobile (Option 1)
Simple approach that prevents the problematic resize behavior while maintaining 3D functionality.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Modify 3D animation system** in `src/three-animation.ts`:
   - Add mobile detection in resize handler
   - Skip resize handling on mobile devices to prevent size jumps
   ```javascript
   private handleResize(): void {
     // Skip resize handling on mobile to prevent size jumps
     if (this.getDeviceType() === 'mobile') {
       return;
     }
     // ... existing resize logic for desktop/tablet
   }
   ```

2. **Skip related tests** temporarily:
   - Disable E2E tests that verify mobile resize behavior
   - Exclude mobile resize code from coverage reports
   - Document which tests are skipped in problem file

3. **Document workaround** with:
   - Implementation details and modified files
   - Limitations (no orientation change handling on mobile)
   - Monitoring requirements
   - Test skip documentation

**Alternative if needed:**
- Implement Option 2 (Debounce Resize Events) if mobile detection approach has issues
- Or Option 3 (Fixed Dimensions) as backup strategy

### Root Cause Analysis for Both Problems
1. **Create failing tests** that reproduce each problem:
   - E2E test for text flash detection
   - E2E test for mobile scroll size jump behavior

2. **Conduct structured analysis**:
   - 5 Whys analysis for text flash timing issue
   - Timeline analysis for mobile viewport behavior during scroll

3. **Transition problems to known-error status** when:
   - Workarounds are implemented and tested
   - Root causes are identified and documented
   - Failing tests are created
