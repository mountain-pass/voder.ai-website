# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 18, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (98.7/100)  
**Current Status**: Outstanding foundation complete - all 15 stories implemented

---

## NOW

**Commit package-lock.json changes to restore clean git state**

The project has achieved outstanding scores (98.7/100) with all 15 development infrastructure stories complete and functional. The only remaining issue is uncommitted changes blocking new story development.

**Immediate Action**:
```bash
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update package-lock.json with install script configuration

- Adds hasInstallScript: true from simple-git-hooks postinstall
- Maintains dependency integrity for git hooks framework
- Completes development infrastructure foundation (15/15 stories)"
git push origin main
```

**Verification**:
- Confirm `git status` shows clean working directory
- Verify all quality gates still pass: `npm run verify`
- Validate git hooks trigger on test commit

**Priority**: Critical - Required to enable new story development  
**Effort**: 2-3 minutes  
**Impact**: Removes blocking issue, enables confident progression to business features

## NEXT

**Optimize development infrastructure and prepare for business content**

With perfect development foundation (98.7/100), focus on minor optimizations and preparing for business content development.

**Actions**:
1. **Markdown linting configuration**: Exclude docs/libraries/ from linting to resolve 662 third-party formatting errors
2. **Dependency updates**: Apply available minor updates (@types/node, @typescript-eslint/*, eslint)
3. **Documentation enhancement**: Add explicit git hooks documentation to README.md
4. **Quality validation**: Verify all quality gates continue working perfectly as project grows
5. **Performance monitoring**: Establish baseline metrics for build and test performance

**Priority**: Medium - Infrastructure optimization and preparation  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Impact**: Resolves remaining minor issues, optimizes developer experience

2. **Production deployment and monitoring**
   - Deploy to production hosting platform
   - Configure performance monitoring and analytics
   - Implement security headers and optimization
   - Set up error tracking and logging systems

3. **Advanced development capabilities**
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline with automated deployment
   - Add Lighthouse performance scoring and optimization
   - Explore advanced caching and optimization strategies
   - Consider headless CMS integration for content management

4. **Team scaling and process evolution**
   - Onboard additional developers using excellent foundation
   - Maintain systematic story management and ADR processes
   - Continue achieving 95%+ assessment scores for quality
