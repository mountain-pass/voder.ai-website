# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 19, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (95% Complete)  
**Current Status**: BLOCKED - Git blockers prevent new development

---

## NOW

**Commit Outstanding Changes to Resolve Git Blockers**

**Immediate Action**: Resolve critical git blockers that prevent any new story development.

**Critical Blockers Identified**:
1. **Uncommitted Changes**: Modified `.voder/implementation-progress.md`
2. **Untracked Files**: New story file `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/020.0-BIZ-PROBLEM-SPACE.md`

**Why This is Critical**:
- Assessment criteria require NO uncommitted changes before new stories
- Project shows exceptional completion (95%) with high-quality implementation
- All technical requirements met: 97/97 tests passing, 95.98% line coverage, 0 security vulnerabilities
- Only git repository state preventing next story development

**Specific Actions Required**:

**Step 1: Review and Commit Changes**
1. **Review assessment**: Verify `.voder/implementation-progress.md` contains accurate assessment results
2. **Review new story**: Confirm `020.0-BIZ-PROBLEM-SPACE.md` is properly formatted and ready
3. **Stage files**: `git add .voder/implementation-progress.md prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/020.0-BIZ-PROBLEM-SPACE.md`
4. **Commit**: `git commit -m "Complete assessment and add problem space analysis story"`
5. **Push**: `git push origin main`

**Step 2: Verification**
- Confirm `git status` shows "working tree clean"
- Verify all changes are pushed to origin/main
- Run `npm run verify` to ensure all quality gates still pass

**Expected Outcome**:
- Clean working directory with no uncommitted changes
- All files properly tracked in git repository
- Ready for immediate next story development
- Maintained 95% project completion with excellent technical foundation

**Time Estimate**: 5-10 minutes for git operations

**Current Project Excellence**:
- ✅ **25+ Stories Implemented**: All core functionality complete with concrete evidence
- ✅ **Testing Excellence**: 97/97 unit tests + 21/21 E2E tests passing, 95.98% line coverage
- ✅ **Zero Security Issues**: Clean npm audit across all 699 dependencies
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Live deployment at https://voder.ai with sub-2s load times
- ✅ **Quality Infrastructure**: All linting, formatting, type checking enforced
