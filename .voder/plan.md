**Ready Story: 016.0-PO-ANALYTICS-TRAFFIC**

**Objective**: Implement traffic source tracking to understand visitor channels and validate LinkedIn-first strategy for AI slop problem validation.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Extend Analytics Integration** (30 minutes):
   - Enhance existing Microsoft Clarity integration in `src/main.ts` 
   - Add UTM parameter capture and traffic source categorization
   - Implement referrer domain analysis and social platform detection

2. **Add Traffic Source Detection** (45 minutes):
   - Create traffic source classification logic (direct, social, search, referral)
   - Add specific LinkedIn traffic identification and attribution
   - Implement UTM parameter tracking for campaign attribution

3. **Testing and Validation** (30 minutes):
   - Add unit tests for traffic source detection logic
   - Update E2E tests to verify analytics events fire correctly
   - Test with different referrer scenarios and UTM parameters

**Success Criteria**: 
- Traffic sources accurately categorized and tracked
- LinkedIn traffic specifically identified
- UTM parameters captured for detailed analysis
- All existing tests continue to pass
   ```javascript
   // Add to each test in tests/e2e/screenshots.spec.ts:
   const consoleErrors: string[] = [];
   page.on('console', msg => {
     if (msg.type() === 'error') {
       consoleErrors.push(msg.text());
