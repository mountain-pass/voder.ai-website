# Implementation Plan

## NOW

**Fix Security Vulnerabilities and Resume Development**

Address the 2 low severity security vulnerabilities in fast-redact package that are blocking development progress. These vulnerabilities are in the netlify-cli dependency chain and have available fixes.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Fix security vulnerabilities**: Run `npm audit fix` to automatically resolve the fast-redact prototype pollution vulnerability
2. **Verify security fix**: Run `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` to confirm no vulnerabilities remain
3. **Test system integrity**: Run `npm run verify` to ensure all linting, formatting, building, and testing still work correctly after the security fixes
4. **Commit security fixes**: Commit the updated package-lock.json with security patches and push to maintain clean repository state
5. **Clean up corrupted assessment file**: Fix the corrupted .voder/implementation-progress.md file that has duplicate content

## NEXT

**Resume Complete Development Workflow**

After security vulnerabilities are resolved, the project will be ready for normal development activities.

1. **Run comprehensive assessment**: Execute full assessment process to get complete project health status
2. **Address any additional issues**: Fix any problems discovered during comprehensive assessment
3. **Continue feature development**: Once assessment shows "READY FOR NEW STORY", proceed with implementing any pending features or improvements

## LATER

**Ongoing Project Maintenance**

Long-term project health and maintenance activities.

1. **Regular dependency updates**: Keep dependencies current to avoid security issues
2. **Continuous quality monitoring**: Maintain code quality through regular assessments
3. **Performance optimization**: Optimize website performance and user experience
4. **Feature enhancements**: Add new features based on user feedback and requirements
