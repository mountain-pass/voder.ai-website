# Development Plan

Based on the assessment findings, this plan addresses the critical blocking issue and outlines the path forward for completing the project.

## NOW

**Implement contact/interest capture functionality for story 021.0-BIZ-CLOSING-MOMENT**

Add a simple interest capture mechanism to resolve the INVALIDATED acceptance criteria AC2. The implementation should:

- Add an email signup form below the "Coming Soon" message in `src/app.ts`
- Include a clear call-to-action like "Get notified when we launch" or "Join the waitlist"
- Implement form submission handling (can be a simple static form for now)
- Style the form to match the existing brand identity and professional presentation
- Ensure the form is responsive across all device types (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Add form validation for email input
- Update E2E tests to validate the contact form functionality
- Run screenshot tests to verify visual consistency

This resolves the blocking INVALIDATED criteria and allows the assessment to proceed to validate remaining stories.

## NEXT

**Complete systematic story validation for remaining 26 stories**

Once the contact form is implemented and story 021.0 is fully validated:

1. Continue the assessment process by validating story 020.0-BIZ-PROBLEM-SPACE
2. Work through all 27 stories in reverse numerical order (020.0 â†’ 001.0)
3. For each story, validate all acceptance criteria with concrete evidence
4. Document any additional INVALIDATED or UNVALIDATED criteria found
5. Address any missing functionality or implementation gaps
6. Update traceability files with validation results and evidence
7. Ensure all quality gates pass (linting, formatting, testing, accessibility)
8. Verify production deployment pipeline works correctly

## LATER

**Post-validation activities and future development**

After all current stories are validated and complete:

1. **Assessment Report Generation**: Create comprehensive final assessment report documenting all validation results, blockers resolved, and readiness status
2. **Next Release Planning**: Plan and prioritize backlog stories for future releases
3. **Performance Optimization**: Address any performance issues identified during validation
4. **Enhanced Analytics**: Expand analytics tracking based on validation findings
5. **Content Refinement**: Improve AI slop problem description and messaging based on user feedback
6. **Advanced Features**: Implement more sophisticated contact/lead management system
7. **SEO Optimization**: Optimize for search engines once content is finalized
8. **A/B Testing Setup**: Prepare for testing different messaging approaches
9. **Integration Preparation**: Plan for future product integrations and API development
