# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 19, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (98% Complete)  
**Current Status**: BLOCKED - Uncommitted changes prevent new development

---

## NOW

**Commit and Push Outstanding Changes**

**Immediate Action**: Resolve critical readiness blocker caused by uncommitted files in working directory.

**Why This is Critical**:
- Assessment requires NO uncommitted changes before starting new stories
- Current uncommitted files block all new development regardless of quality  
- All quality gates are passing (87.52% statement coverage, 83.54% branch coverage)
- Project has exceptional implementation quality (98% complete) but needs clean working tree

**Files Requiring Commit** (5 files modified):
1. **Modified: `.voder/implementation-progress.md`** - Updated comprehensive assessment report
2. **Modified: `src/main.ts`** - Analytics initialization improvements
3. **Modified: `src/traffic-analytics.ts`** - Enhanced analytics implementation
4. **Modified: `tests/coverage-increase.test.ts`** - Additional test coverage
5. **Modified: `tests/traffic-analytics.test.ts`** - Enhanced analytics testing

**Required Actions**:
1. Review changes with `git diff` to confirm they are appropriate
2. Add all changes: `git add .`
3. Commit with descriptive message: `git commit -m "Complete analytics implementation and update assessment"`
4. Push to origin: `git push origin main`
5. Verify clean status: `git status` should show "working tree clean"

**Expected Outcome**:
- Clean working directory with no uncommitted changes
- All analytics enhancements safely committed and pushed to origin/main
- Ready to proceed with next story development
- Maintain exceptional 98% project completion rate

**Time Estimate**: 5-10 minutes to commit and verify clean status

## NEXT

**Continue with Next In-Scope Story Development**

Once the readiness blocker is resolved, the project is ready for continued story development.

**Current Project Status**:
- **98% Complete**: Exceptional implementation quality achieved
- **All Major Analytics Implemented**: Page views, traffic sources, sessions, and bounce tracking complete
- **Zero Security Vulnerabilities**: npm audit clean
- **Quality Gates Passing**: All linting, formatting, and type checking successful
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 88/88 tests passing with strong coverage

**Next Story Options**:
Since analytics stories appear to be implemented already, focus on:

1. **Verify All Requirements Satisfied**: Systematically review any remaining acceptance criteria
2. **Quality Improvement**: Address coverage gaps to reach 90%+ branch coverage threshold  
3. **Documentation Enhancement**: Ensure all implementation matches documented requirements
4. **Production Validation**: Verify deployed website at https://voder.ai functions correctly

**Implementation Approach**:
1. **Review In-Scope Stories**: Check for any remaining unimplemented acceptance criteria
2. **Coverage Enhancement**: Identify and test uncovered branches in analytics code
3. **E2E Validation**: Ensure all analytics tracking works in production environment
4. **Performance Verification**: Confirm optimized bundle sizes and fast loading

**Quality Standards**:
- Maintain all linting, formatting, and type checking standards
- Achieve 90%+ branch coverage threshold  
- Ensure E2E tests validate production functionality
- Keep zero security vulnerabilities

**Expected Outcome**: Project ready for Release 0.5 completion or new feature development
