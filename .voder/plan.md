# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 18, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (85/100) - Single critical blocker identified  
**Current Status**: Release 0.5 mostly complete with one E2E test failure blocking completion

## NOW

**ðŸŽ¯ Fix E2E Test Title Mismatch to Complete Release 0.5**

**Assessment Summary**: The project is 85% complete with excellent infrastructure (100% security, code quality, version control) and functional implementation. However, there is one critical blocker preventing story completion: E2E tests are failing due to a title mismatch.

**Single Critical Blocking Issue**:

**E2E Test Title Validation Failure** (CRITICAL - Story 012.3-DEV-E2E-TESTING)
- **Issue**: Test expects "Voder - The Compiler for Prompts" but application shows "Voder - Keep Shipping Fast"
- **Location**: `tests/e2e/app.spec.ts:9` - `await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Voder - The Compiler for Prompts/);`
- **Current State**: 3/21 E2E tests failing across all browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- **Evidence**: Terminal output shows consistent failure pattern with title mismatch
- **Impact**: Blocks deployment pipeline and story completion

**Required Action**:

1. **Investigate Title Source**: 
   - Check `index.html` `<title>` tag
   - Check if title is set dynamically in JavaScript
   - Verify which title is correct per business requirements

2. **Choose Resolution Path**:
   - **Option A**: Update test to match current title: `/Voder - Keep Shipping Fast/`
   - **Option B**: Update application title to match test expectation
   - **Decision needed**: Confirm with business which title is correct

3. **Fix and Verify**:
   ```bash
   # After fixing, verify resolution:
   npm run e2e:ci
   # Should show 21/21 tests passing
   ```

**Success Criteria**: All E2E tests pass (21/21) with no title mismatch errors
   ```javascript
   // Add to each test in tests/e2e/screenshots.spec.ts:
   const consoleErrors: string[] = [];
   page.on('console', msg => {
     if (msg.type() === 'error') {
       consoleErrors.push(msg.text());

## NEXT

**Post-Fix Validation: Complete Release 0.5 and Prepare for New Stories**

After resolving the E2E test title mismatch, validate the complete system and establish readiness for new story development.

**Release 0.5 Completion Validation** (1-2 hours):

1. **E2E Test Suite Validation**:
   - Run complete E2E test suite to confirm all 21 tests pass
   - Verify screenshot tests continue to work across all viewports
   - Validate console error monitoring is functioning in E2E tests
   - Confirm performance validation tests meet established thresholds

2. **Story Acceptance Verification**:
   - Re-verify 012.3-DEV-E2E-TESTING story fully meets acceptance criteria
   - Confirm all other story requirements remain satisfied
   - Update implementation progress assessment to reflect completion
   - Document final evidence of all functional requirements met

3. **Production Readiness Confirmation**:
   - Run full verification pipeline: `npm run verify`
   - Confirm build, tests, linting, and formatting all pass
   - Validate deployment-ready state with functional E2E tests
   - Test production build works correctly with `npm run build && npm run preview`

**New Story Readiness Assessment** (15 minutes):

4. **Quality Gate Verification**:
   - All linting, formatting, type checking, and tests passing
   - Zero security vulnerabilities across all dependencies
   - 100% test coverage maintained including new console error tests
   - Production deployment verified functional

5. **Technical Debt and Process Improvements**:
   - Review assessment methodology to prevent future implementation validation gaps
   - Improve story acceptance criteria to require functional testing evidence
   - Enhance documentation of proper library integration patterns
   - Create testing checklist for verifying claimed functionality actually works
