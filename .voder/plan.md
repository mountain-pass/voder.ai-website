# Critical Visual Layout Fix Plan

## NOW

**Fix the critical 3D cube positioning and mobile layout breaks immediately**

The core issue is that the CSS layout assumes a linear vertical flow, but the 3D cube needs to be positioned absolutely behind/between the content elements while the text content needs proper viewport allocation. The current implementation has several critical flaws:

1. **3D Cube Positioning Problem**: The hero-animation div is in document flow but positioned with absolute canvas inside, creating layout conflicts
2. **Mobile Layout Breaks**: Viewport-relative units are causing text overflow and poor containment on small screens
3. **Content Overlap**: Elements are fighting for the same viewport space instead of being properly layered

**Immediate Fix Strategy**:
- Change hero-animation to position: absolute to remove it from document flow
- Fix mobile text sizing to use proper responsive units (rem/em instead of vw which causes overflow)
- Restructure the main layout to be overlay-based rather than sequential
- Ensure 3D cube renders behind content as visual background, not competing for layout space

**Key Changes**:
1. Make `.hero-animation` position: absolute and center it on viewport as background
2. Convert `.hero-section` to use full viewport height with proper internal spacing
3. Fix mobile typography to prevent text cutoff (remove vw units for text)
4. Ensure proper z-index layering so cube appears behind content

## NEXT

**Verify the 3D animation system is working correctly**

After fixing the layout structure, ensure the 3D cube is actually rendering:
1. Test 3D animation initialization and rendering 
2. Verify WebGL context creation is working
3. Check for any JavaScript errors preventing cube display
4. Ensure the cube appears correctly across all device types

**Validate responsive scaling system**:
1. Test mathematical viewport relationships work correctly
2. Verify smooth transitions between breakpoints
3. Ensure touch targets are properly sized on mobile

## LATER

**Optimize and polish the layout implementation**

Once the critical issues are resolved:
1. Fine-tune the mathematical spacing relationships for better visual balance
2. Optimize performance of viewport-relative calculations
3. Add smooth animations for responsive transitions
4. Consider progressive enhancement for 3D features on low-power devices
