# Implementation Plan

## NOW

**Fix Code Coverage Thresholds to Meet Quality Gates**

The critical blocker is failing test coverage thresholds. Current coverage (79.54% lines, 82.6% functions, 79.54% statements) falls short of required thresholds (89% lines, 90% functions, 89% statements). 

**Primary Issue**: `three-animation.ts` has only 26.31% line coverage, significantly dragging down overall project coverage.

**Immediate Action**: 
1. Examine `three-animation.ts` uncovered lines (152-256, 259-262 according to coverage report)
2. Add comprehensive unit tests for the ThreeAnimation class to cover:
   - WebGL support detection and fallback handling
   - Animation initialization and cleanup
   - Scene setup and rendering loop
   - Error handling paths
   - Browser compatibility checks
3. Target bringing `three-animation.ts` coverage from 26.31% to at least 80% to lift overall project coverage above thresholds

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Success Criteria**: `npm run verify` passes completely without coverage threshold failures

## NEXT

**Improve Error Handling Coverage in app.ts**

After resolving the primary coverage issue, address the secondary gap in `app.ts` (82.89% coverage with missing lines 171, 176-190). These appear to be error handling and edge case paths that need test coverage.

**Actions**:
1. Add tests for error scenarios in the app initialization
2. Test edge cases for missing DOM elements
3. Cover error handling paths in the email form functionality

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours

## LATER

**Optimize Test Performance and Coverage Collection**

Once coverage thresholds are met and the quality gates pass:

1. **Performance Optimization**: 
   - Review test execution time (currently 1.89s for 112 tests)
   - Optimize slow-running tests if needed
   - Consider parallel test execution improvements

2. **Coverage Refinement**:
   - Evaluate if any files should be excluded from coverage (like pure type definitions)
   - Consider adjusting thresholds if current levels prove adequate for project maturity
   - Add integration tests for better real-world coverage

3. **Quality Enhancements**:
   - Add more comprehensive E2E test coverage
   - Implement visual regression testing for 3D animations
   - Add performance benchmarks for animation rendering

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours over multiple iterations

**Note**: This plan focuses exclusively on implementation work to resolve the blocking coverage issues. No further assessment, validation, or traceability work is needed - those phases are complete.
