# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 19, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (95% Complete)  
**Current Status**: BLOCKED - Uncommitted changes prevent new development

---

## NOW

**Commit and Push Outstanding Changes**

**Immediate Action**: Resolve critical readiness blocker caused by uncommitted files in working directory.

**Why This is Critical**:
- Assessment prompt requires NO uncommitted changes before starting new stories
- Current uncommitted files block all new development regardless of quality
- All quality gates are passing (100% statement coverage, 90.9% branch coverage)
- Project is otherwise excellent and ready for next story

**Files Requiring Commit**:
1. **Modified: `.voder/implementation-progress.md`** - Updated assessment report with corrected status
2. **Modified: `src/style.css`** - CSS lint fix (removed duplicate background-clip property)
3. **Untracked: `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/017.0-PO-ANALYTICS-SESSIONS.md`** - New story file moved from backlog
4. **Untracked: `.voder/implementation-progress.md.backup`** - Backup file (can be removed)

**Required Actions**:
1. Review changes with `git diff` to confirm they are appropriate
2. Remove backup file: `rm .voder/implementation-progress.md.backup`
3. Add all changes: `git add .`
4. Commit with descriptive message: `git commit -m "Fix CSS lint issue and update assessment report"`
5. Push to origin: `git push origin main`
6. Verify clean status: `git status` should show "working tree clean"

**Expected Outcome**:
- Clean working directory with no uncommitted changes
- All changes safely committed and pushed to origin/main
- Ready to proceed with next story development (017.0-PO-ANALYTICS-SESSIONS)

**Time Estimate**: 5-10 minutes to commit and verify clean status

## NEXT

**Implement Session Analytics Story (017.0-PO-ANALYTICS-SESSIONS)**

Once the readiness blocker is resolved, proceed with the next story in sequence.

**Story Overview**:
- Newly moved from backlog to in-scope
- Session tracking and duration analytics for product owner visibility
- Builds on existing Microsoft Clarity analytics foundation
- Extends current traffic analytics implementation

**Implementation Approach**:
1. **Read Complete Story Requirements**: Review 017.0-PO-ANALYTICS-SESSIONS.md acceptance criteria
2. **Extend Analytics Infrastructure**: Build on existing `traffic-analytics.ts` foundation
3. **Session Duration Tracking**: Implement session start/end timing and duration calculation
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Ensure session data flows to Microsoft Clarity reporting
5. **Test Coverage**: Maintain 90%+ coverage requirement with comprehensive session tests
6. **E2E Validation**: Verify session tracking works in production environment

**Quality Standards**:
- All linting, formatting, and type checking must pass
- Test coverage maintained above 90% branch coverage threshold
- E2E tests validate session tracking functionality
- No security vulnerabilities introduced

**Expected Outcome**: Complete session analytics implementation with full dashboard visibility
