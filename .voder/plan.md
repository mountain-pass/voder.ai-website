# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 17, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (97.5/100)  
**Current Status**: Development foundation excellent, minor compliance gaps to address

---

## NOW

**Create LICENSE file to complete licensing requirements**

The project is currently missing a LICENSE file with "All Rights Reserved" statement, which is required by REQ-LICENSE-FILE in story 003.0-DEV-ENV-DEPS. This is the only unmet requirement preventing 100% compliance.

**Action**: Create a LICENSE file in the project root containing:
```
All Rights Reserved

Copyright (c) 2025 [Company Name]

This software and associated documentation files are proprietary and confidential. 
No part of this software may be reproduced, distributed, or transmitted in any form 
or by any means without the prior written permission of the copyright owner.
```

**Priority**: Critical - Required for story completion and licensing compliance  
**Effort**: 5 minutes  
**Impact**: Completes final requirement for 003.0-DEV-ENV-DEPS story

## NEXT

**Repository cleanup and maintenance tasks**

1. **Git working directory cleanup**
   - Commit or remove the large number of deleted files in working directory
   - Clean up prompts-old/ and other artifact files that were tracked
   - Ensure .gitignore properly excludes temporary files going forward

2. **Dependency maintenance**
   - Update dependencies with available minor versions:
     - @types/node: 22.18.1 → 22.18.5
     - @typescript-eslint/*: 8.43.0 → 8.44.0
     - eslint: 9.34.0 → 9.35.0
     - htmlhint: 1.6.3 → 1.7.1
   - Consider major version updates where appropriate (jsdom, jest-axe)

3. **Documentation enhancement**
   - Review and update any outdated references in documentation
   - Ensure all setup instructions remain current after dependency updates

**Priority**: Medium - Quality and maintenance improvements  
**Effort**: 1-2 hours  
**Impact**: Maintains project hygiene and keeps dependencies current

## LATER

**Feature development and expansion**

1. **Website content implementation**
   - The current implementation is a minimal landing page
   - Future stories will likely add business content sections
   - Prepare for analytics integration and user engagement features

2. **Development process enhancements**
   - Consider implementing pre-commit hooks for quality enforcement
   - Explore CI/CD pipeline optimizations
   - Add performance monitoring and lighthouse scoring

3. **Architecture considerations**
   - Evaluate need for additional development tools or frameworks
   - Plan for content management if business requirements expand
   - Consider deployment pipeline improvements

4. **Story backlog development**
   - Implement future stories as they are defined in prompts/release-0.5/backlog/
   - Currently only 4 stories exist, more will be added based on business needs
   - Maintain the excellent quality standards established in the foundation

**Priority**: Low - Future planning and enhancement  
**Effort**: Varies by feature  
**Impact**: Supports future growth and business requirements
