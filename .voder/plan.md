## ðŸš§ IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Architecture Patterns for Each Phase

```typescript
class TransitionController {
  trigger: ScrollTrigger | TimeBasedTrigger | InteractionTrigger;
  duration: number; // in milliseconds, specified in prompts
  phases: AnimationPhase[];
  accessibilityHandler: A11yHandler;
  testSelectors: TestSelector[];
  reducedMotionFallback: StaticState;
}
```

### Development Principles

1. **Maintain Test Coverage:** All 57 tests must continue passing throughout development
2. **Accessibility First:** Every visual enhancement must respect WCAG 2.1 AA requirements  
3. **Progressive Enhancement:** Build graceful fallbacks for all advanced features
4. **Performance Budgets:** No feature ships if it degrades core performance metrics
5. **Device Detection:** Sophisticated capability detection for appropriate feature delivery
6. **Specification Compliance:** Every feature must match the detailed prompts documentation

### Technical Implementation Strategy

- **Animation Framework:** Build on existing GSAP/ScrollTrigger infrastructure
- **3D Systems:** Extend established Three.js foundation from BrandEntry3D.ts and VisualChaos.ts
- **State Management:** Maintain stateless functional component architecture  
- **Testing Strategy:** Add visual regression tests for each animation state
- **Performance Monitoring:** Continuous frame rate and load time validation
- **Cross-Browser Support:** Test on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and mobile devices

- **March 2025 Target:** 85% complete (all interactive systems)  
- **May 2025 Target:** 100% complete (full specification compliance)

### Quality Gates

Each phase must pass:

- All existing tests continue passing
- New features have comprehensive test coverage  
- Performance benchmarks remain within targets
- Accessibility audit shows no regressions
- Cross-browser compatibility verified
- Visual regression tests pass on key animation states

**This plan reflects the actual state of the codebase and provides a realistic path to 100% specification compliance within 5-8 weeks of focused development.**
