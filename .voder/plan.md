## NOW

**ðŸŽ¯ Complete Story 014.1-DEV-PROD-VERIFICATION: Production Site Verification**

**Assessment Summary**: The project is 85% complete with very strong implementation quality. 17/22 stories are fully complete, 4 are partially complete, and 1 is not started. All critical readiness criteria are met with zero blockers.

**Current Strong State**:
- âœ… **Functionality**: 85% - 17/22 stories complete, core features working
- âœ… **Code Quality**: 95% - All linting, formatting, type checking pass
- âœ… **Testing**: 90% - 44 tests passing, E2E screenshots working  
- âœ… **Execution**: 95% - Build succeeds, dev server functional
- âœ… **Security**: 100% - 0 vulnerabilities in all dependencies
- âœ… **Version Control**: 100% - Clean working directory, all commits pushed

**Next Priority: Production Verification System**

**Objective**: Implement production site verification and health checking system to ensure deployed site works correctly and can be monitored.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Create Health Check Scripts** (45 minutes):
   - Implement `scripts/health-check.js` for production URL verification
   - Add HTTP status checking, response time monitoring, and content validation
   - Create deployment status verification with proper error handling

2. **Add Production Verification Tests** (30 minutes):
   - Extend E2E tests to run against production URL (PREVIEW_URL env var)
   - Add performance validation and accessibility checking
   - Implement console error monitoring for production site

3. **Create Monitoring Utilities** (30 minutes):
   - Add health check utilities in `scripts/health-check-utils.js`
   - Implement status reporting and alerting mechanisms
   - Create verification reporting for deployment validation

4. **Integration and Documentation** (15 minutes):
   - Update package.json scripts for production verification
   - Add verification to deployment pipeline
   - Document health check procedures and monitoring setup

**Success Criteria**: 
- Production site accessibility verified automatically
- Health checks detect issues and report status
- Verification integrated into deployment workflow
- All existing tests continue to pass
   ```javascript
   // Add to each test in tests/e2e/screenshots.spec.ts:
   const consoleErrors: string[] = [];
   page.on('console', msg => {
     if (msg.type() === 'error') {
       consoleErrors.push(msg.text());
