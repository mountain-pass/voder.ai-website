# Implementation Plan

## NOW

**Implement the 3D animation story (025.0-BIZ-3D-ANIMATION)**

Based on the project history showing Release 0.5 was completed in September 2025 and the package.json showing version 1.0.0, we are currently working on Release 1.0 features. The 3D animation story is a legitimate current requirement that needs implementation.

Start with the simplest 3D implementation that could work:
1. Create a basic Three.js scene with a simple geometric shape (cube or sphere)
2. Add basic mouse interaction (rotation on hover)
3. Implement progressive loading with a 2D fallback
4. Ensure it displays in the hero section without breaking existing functionality

## NEXT

**Enhance and polish the 3D animation**

After the basic 3D implementation is working:

- Add more sophisticated 3D models and animations
- Implement scroll-based interactions
- Optimize performance for mobile devices
- Add accessibility controls (motion reduction preferences)
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Test cross-browser compatibility and add fallbacks

## LATER

**Complete remaining Release 1.0 stories and advanced features**

Continue with other Release 1.0 features and enhancements:

- Complete any other unimplemented Release 1.0 stories identified in the assessment
- Add advanced 3D interactions and particle systems
- Implement sophisticated animations and transitions
- Performance optimize for various device capabilities
- Add analytics tracking for 3D interaction engagement

The key principle here is to start with the simplest 3D implementation that provides immediate value, then iterate and enhance based on user feedback and performance metrics.
