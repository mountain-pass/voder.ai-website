# Implementation Plan

Based on the assessment finding that story 026.00-BIZ-NARRATIVE-CONTENT-FOUNDATION is incomplete, we need to implement the "Remember when..." narrative content.

## NOW

Implement the complete "Remember when..." narrative content section in `src/app.ts` between the problem section and email signup form, following the story requirements:

1. Add the narrative content section with 100vh container height
2. Include all 5 acts of the narrative (Magic → Peak → Turn → Chaos → Reality) 
3. Use proper semantic HTML structure with meaningful CSS classes
4. Apply professional typography that matches the site's teal theme
5. Ensure content is readable across all viewport sizes
6. Use the exact narrative text specified in the story requirements
7. Include all emotional keywords with appropriate styling for future enhancement
8. Ensure no debugging CSS (green borders, etc.)

## NEXT

After implementing the narrative content:

1. Run visual assessment to ensure content quality and styling meets requirements
2. Verify the content displays correctly in natural document flow
3. Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes
4. Ensure the 100vh container works properly for scroll foundation

## LATER

Future enhancements to the narrative section:

1. Add scroll-driven animation effects (separate story)
2. Implement cinematic overlay system (separate story)  
3. Add viewport-fixed timeline effects (separate story)
4. Enhance emotional keyword styling with dynamic effects (separate story)
