# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 18, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (87.1/100) - 18 of 19 stories complete  
**Current Status**: Excellent project quality - analytics implementation and security vulnerabilities need attention

---

## NOW

**Restore clean git state and implement analytics tracking (Story 015.0-PO-ANALYTICS-PAGEVIEWS)**

**Current Situation**: The comprehensive assessment revealed 18 of 19 stories are complete (87.1/100). Story 015.0-PO-ANALYTICS-PAGEVIEWS is incomplete - Microsoft Clarity dependency is installed but not integrated. Uncommitted files prevent clean git state required for systematic development.

**Immediate Action Required**:
1. **Track untracked files and commit current state**:
   ```bash
   git add prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/015.0-PO-ANALYTICS-PAGEVIEWS.md
   git add .voder/implementation-progress.md
   git commit -m "feat: add analytics story and update assessment"
   ```

2. **Implement Microsoft Clarity analytics integration**:
   - Add Clarity import and initialization in `src/main.ts`
   - Configure Clarity with environment variable `CLARITY_PROJECT_ID=t5zu4kays7`
   - Test analytics integration works correctly on local and production
   - Update tests to handle analytics initialization gracefully

3. **Create analytics tooling ADR**:
   - Document decision to use Microsoft Clarity for pageview tracking
   - Create `docs/decisions/XXXX-use-microsoft-clarity-for-analytics.accepted.md`
   - Follow MADR 4.0 format with rationale and alternatives considered

4. **Verify story completion**:
   - Confirm all REQ-PAGEVIEW-TRACKING requirements met
   - Test visitor counting and metrics access functionality
   - Ensure privacy compliance with visitor data handling

**Priority**: Critical - Required to complete Release 0.5 and restore clean development workflow  
**Effort**: 2-4 hours  
**Impact**: Achieves analytics visibility for product owner and completes story portfolio

## NEXT

**Address security vulnerabilities and complete Release 0.5 excellence**

After implementing analytics tracking and restoring clean git state, address remaining quality issues to achieve exceptional completion.

**Priority Actions**:
1. **Resolve security vulnerabilities in deployment tooling**:
   - Evaluate impact of upgrading to `vercel@25.2.0` (breaking change)
   - Test deployment pipeline with security fixes applied
   - Address 10 vulnerabilities (6 moderate, 4 high) in Vercel CLI tools
   - Verify deployment automation continues working after upgrades

2. **Validate complete story portfolio**:
   - Run comprehensive verification pipeline to ensure all 19 stories functional
   - Execute `npm run verify` to confirm all quality gates pass
   - Test both local development and production deployment flows
   - Update project history with Release 0.5 completion milestone

3. **Achieve target assessment score**:
   - Run final comprehensive assessment to achieve 90%+ score
   - Document any remaining minor issues and mitigation strategies
   - Ensure all story acceptance criteria verified and functional
   - Prepare for Release 1.0 planning with clean foundation

**Priority**: High - Required to complete Release 0.5 with exceptional quality  
**Effort**: 4-6 hours  
**Impact**: Achieves complete story portfolio (19/19) with security best practices and 90%+ assessment score
