# Implementation Plan

## NOW

**Apply the 3 mature dependency upgrades identified in Phase 1 assessment:**

Execute the upgrade command for the 3 packages that meet the 7-day smart selection criteria:

```bash
npm install eslint@9.38.0 @eslint/js@9.38.0 @playwright/test@1.56.1
```

Then verify the upgrades work correctly:
- Run `npm run lint` to verify ESLint functionality
- Run `npm run test:e2e` to verify Playwright functionality  
- Run `npm test` to run the full test suite
- Run `npm audit` to recheck security status

All 3 packages were released on October 17, 2025 (exactly 7 days ago), meeting the maturity threshold.

## NEXT

**Clean up the assessment report file:**

The `.voder/assessment-report.md` file contains two reports merged together (an older one from Oct 23 and the new one from Oct 24). Clean this up by keeping only the latest Phase 1 report.

**Commit the dependency upgrades:**

After verifying the upgrades work correctly, commit the changes with a descriptive message explaining what was upgraded and why.

## LATER

**Schedule next comprehensive assessment for October 30:**

By October 30, the remaining 10 outdated packages will have matured (≥7 days old):
- jsdom (matures Oct 25)
- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin and @typescript-eslint/parser (mature Oct 27)
- @axe-core/playwright, @types/node, happy-dom (mature Oct 28)  
- netlify-cli, vite, vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8 (mature Oct 30)

The vitest packages require special attention as they are MAJOR version updates (3.2.4 → 4.0.2) that will need breaking change analysis.

**Plan vitest 3→4 migration:**

When the vitest packages mature on Oct 30, dedicate 2-4 hours to:
- Review vitest v4.0.0, v4.0.1, v4.0.2 changelogs
- Read the official vitest v3→v4 migration guide
- Assess configuration changes required
- Verify compatibility with Vite
- Test migration in a separate branch
- Update test suite if needed
- Ensure @vitest/coverage-v8 is upgraded in sync with vitest
