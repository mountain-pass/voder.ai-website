## NOW



**Create the minimal GitHub Actions deployment workflow for story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-SIMPLE**## NOW



Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the exact implementation specified in the story:

- Trigger on push to main branch only

- Set up Node.js 20 environment with npm caching**Fix Story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION: Implement GitHub Actions Controlled Deployment**## NOW

- Install dependencies with `npm ci`

- Run production build with `npm run build`

- Deploy to Vercel using `npx vercel --prod --token ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}`

Update the deployment architecture to use GitHub Actions controlled deployment instead of Vercel's automatic deployment approach:

This is the absolute simplest deployment workflow that could possibly work, following the story's implementation approach exactly. No quality gates, no complex error handling - just the core deployment functionality.



## NEXT

1. **Update vercel.json configuration**:**Fix CI workflow pnpm setup error that's causing deployment protection failure**Debug and fix the current Vercel deployment failures that are causing production deployments to show "Error" status. Investigate the root cause by:

**Verify Vercel project configuration and build dependencies**

   - Remove `github.deploymentStatus` and `requiredStatusChecks` properties

1. Confirm `npm run build` script works correctly (already verified in previous terminals)

2. Check if Vercel project needs any additional configuration files   - Add `git.deploymentEnabled: false` to disable Vercel automatic deployments

3. Ensure the build output directory is correctly configured for Vercel deployment

4. Add any missing Vercel-specific configuration if needed for the deployment to work   - Keep minimal build configuration since GitHub Actions will handle quality checks



**Test the deployment workflow locally**The CI workflow is failing with "No pnpm version is specified" error (exit code 4), which is preventing the deployment protection from working correctly. The GitHub Actions workflow needs to specify the pnpm version either in the workflow config or package.json packageManager field. 1. Checking Vercel deployment logs for the failed deployments using `vercel logs <deployment-url>`



1. Install Vercel CLI locally to test deployment commands2. **Modify deploy.yml workflow**:

2. Test the workflow steps manually to ensure they work before pushing

3. Verify the built site deploys correctly to Vercel   - Add Vercel CLI installation step



## LATER   - Replace deployment notification with actual Vercel CLI deployment commands



**Complete remaining unvalidated stories from the assessment**   - Add deployment verification using `vercel ls` and `vercel inspect`Current evidence shows:2. Reviewing the build command `npm run deploy:check` that runs `npm run verify && npm run screenshots` to identify which step is failingDebug and fix the current Vercel deployment failures that are causing production deployments to show "Error" status. Investigate the root cause by:



After the deployment workflow is working, implement any missing functionality from the other 23 stories that were not validated due to the fail-fast trigger. Focus on the core functionality needed for the website:   - Add workflow dependencies to wait for CI completion before deploying



1. Complete any missing build tooling or configuration   - Include Vercel deployment URLs in GitHub Actions status output- CI workflow failing with pnpm setup error

2. Implement missing analytics functionality

3. Complete any missing UI components or styling

4. Add any missing testing or linting that blocks deployment quality

3. **Add required environment variables**:- This failure should block deployments but isn't3. Testing the build pipeline locally to reproduce the deployment issue

**Enhance deployment workflow with basic quality gates**

   - Ensure `VERCEL_TOKEN` secret is configured in GitHub repository settings

Once the simple deployment works, gradually add minimal quality improvements:

1. Add basic error handling and status reporting   - Configure Vercel project linking for CLI deployment- Need to add pnpm version specification to fix the workflow

2. Add simple deployment success verification

3. Consider adding minimal quality checks before deployment if needed



The focus is on getting the simplest possible deployment working first, then incrementally improving it based on what actually breaks or needs enhancement.4. **Test deployment control**:4. Fixing any issues found in the build process, dependencies, or configuration1. Checking Vercel deployment logs for the failed deployments using `vercel logs <deployment-url>`

   - Verify that failed CI blocks deployment triggering

   - Confirm successful CI triggers deployment automaticallyAction: Update the CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) to specify pnpm version in the "Setup pnpm" step, or add packageManager field to package.json to specify the pnpm version.

   - Validate deployment verification reports actual status

5. Ensuring the production site returns HTTP 200 instead of HTTP 401 by resolving authentication/access issues

Based on the assessment findings, there are deployment errors happening in production (latest error 9 minutes ago, previous error 13 hours ago) while the deployment protection configuration appears correct.The critical blocker is the systematic failure of the `.github/workflows/e2e-stability.yml` workflow. All recent runs fail immediately with "workflow file issue" errors and 0s duration. This must be resolved to complete story 021.4-DEV-CI-STABILITY.
