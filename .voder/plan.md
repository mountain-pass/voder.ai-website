# Implementation Plan

Based on current project status analysis, this plan focuses on completing the few remaining implementation gaps to achieve 100% story completion. The project already has exceptional quality infrastructure and is production-deployed.

## NOW

**Complete Git Hooks Implementation (012.1-DEV-GIT-HOOKS)**

The git hooks story has missing acceptance criteria that need implementation:

- Install simple-git-hooks package to automate git hook setup
- Create pre-commit hook that runs quality validation pipeline (lint → format → type check → test)
- Configure hooks to install automatically during `npm install` 
- Add npm script to run the same validation checks that hooks will run
- Test hook functionality by making a commit with code that fails quality checks
- Document hook behavior and bypass instructions for developers

This is the simplest missing piece - just adding automated quality enforcement to an already robust development environment. Implementation should take 15-30 minutes and immediately improves development workflow quality.

## NEXT

**Complete E2E Screenshots Implementation (012.4-DEV-E2E-SCREENSHOTS)**

The E2E screenshot testing has some unmet criteria:

- Enhance existing Playwright config for comprehensive screenshot testing across all viewports
- Implement visual regression detection for UI changes
- Add performance metrics capture during test execution  
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility validation (already partially working)
- Create npm scripts for running screenshot tests (may already exist)
- Document screenshot testing workflow and CI integration

**Complete Missing Brand and Closing Moment Details**

- Review brand entry story (013.0-BIZ-BRAND-ENTRY) acceptance criteria
- Review closing moment story (021.0-BIZ-CLOSING-MOMENT) acceptance criteria  
- Complete any missing responsive design requirements
- Ensure accessibility compliance meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Complete any missing professional presentation requirements

## LATER

**Optimize and Polish**

- Review all story acceptance criteria systematically to identify any remaining gaps
- Optimize build performance (currently ~400ms, could potentially improve)
- Consider additional quality gates if beneficial
- Enhance documentation based on actual usage patterns
- Consider advanced analytics features if valuable
- Plan for team scaling and contributor onboarding improvements

**Future Growth Preparation**

- Evaluate dependency management and update strategies
- Consider advanced deployment strategies (blue-green, feature flags, etc.)
- Plan for increased traffic and performance monitoring
- Evaluate additional security hardening opportunities
- Consider advanced testing strategies (contract testing, chaos engineering)
