# Voder.ai Website Implementation Plan

## NOW

Convert all time-based and trigger-based animations to use GSAP ScrollTrigger with `scrub` for true scroll-tied behavior across all sections and transitions. Ensure all animations pause, reverse, and progress smoothly with scroll, and that transitions are fully bidirectional.

## NEXT

- Add missing visual details: morphing backgrounds in The Why, color-coded and realistic code fragments in Problem Space, progressive disclosure in Outcome Focus, and cinematic fade/signature glow in Closing Moment.
- Implement automated screenshot analysis or manual review logs to compare Playwright screenshots to the specification for visual compliance.
- Refactor any remaining accessibility or ARIA gaps discovered during animation and visual upgrades.

## LATER

- Optimize performance for scroll-tied animations and 3D scenes.
- Expand test coverage for edge cases and mobile/tablet layouts.
- Polish micro-interactions, ambient feedback, and motion accessibility controls.
- Prepare for future content or feature additions as the product evolves.
