# Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: WAITING FOR DEPENDENCIES TO MATURE  
**Assessment**: Phase 1 (Dependencies) BLOCKED - All packages too recent

---

## NOW

**Wait for dependencies to mature - No immediate implementation work available**

The assessment has identified that all 10 outdated npm packages have releases that are too recent (0-5 days old, below the 7-day maturity threshold per Smart Version Selection Algorithm). 

**Current Situation**:
- ‚úÖ All problems in `docs/problems/` are closed or resolved
- ‚úÖ Project is functional with current dependencies
- ‚úÖ Security vulnerabilities are LOW severity (acceptable as residual risk)
- ‚ùå All package updates blocked by recency (< 7 days old)

**Earliest Action Date**: 2025-10-26 (in 2 days)

**No implementation work can proceed** until packages mature. The assessment framework correctly applies the Smart Version Selection Algorithm to prevent rushing unstable package updates.

**Alternative**: If urgent work is needed, continue with current dependencies and re-assess on 2025-10-31.

## NEXT

**Phased dependency updates (2025-10-26 to 2025-10-31)**

### Phase A: 2025-10-26 (Safe, isolated patch update)
1. Update `jsdom` from 27.0.0 to 27.0.1
2. Run full test suite to verify compatibility
3. Commit changes with message: "chore: update jsdom to 27.0.1 (7+ days mature)"

### Phase B: 2025-10-28 (Coordinated ecosystem patch updates)
1. Update `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` from 8.46.1 to 8.46.2
2. Update `@typescript-eslint/parser` from 8.46.1 to 8.46.2
3. Run linting and type checking
4. Run full test suite
5. Commit changes with message: "chore: update @typescript-eslint packages to 8.46.2 (7+ days mature)"

### Phase C: 2025-10-29 (Testing and tooling updates)
1. Update `@axe-core/playwright` from 4.10.2 to 4.11.0
2. Update `@types/node` from 24.7.2 to 24.9.1
3. Update `happy-dom` from 20.0.2 to 20.0.8
4. Run accessibility tests
5. Run full test suite
6. Commit changes with message: "chore: update testing tools and type definitions (7+ days mature)"

### Phase D: 2025-10-31 (Security fixes and major version updates)
1. **Review vitest 4.x migration guide** - Check for breaking changes
2. Update `netlify-cli` from 23.9.3 to 23.9.4 (üîí resolves security vulnerabilities)
3. Update `vite` from 7.1.11 to 7.1.12
4. Update `vitest` from 3.2.4 to 4.0.2 (MAJOR)
5. Update `@vitest/coverage-v8` from 3.2.4 to 4.0.2 (MAJOR)
6. Update vitest configuration if needed for v4 compatibility
7. Run comprehensive test suite
8. Verify security vulnerabilities resolved: `npm audit`
9. Commit changes with message: "chore: update to vitest 4.x and resolve netlify-cli security issues (7+ days mature)"

### Post-Update Verification
1. Run all quality gates: `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, `npm run test`, `npm run test:e2e`
2. Build production bundle: `npm run build`
3. Preview production build: `npm run preview`
4. Verify no new npm audit vulnerabilities
5. Run final assessment cycle to confirm all dependencies healthy

## LATER

**Future enhancements and optimizations (after dependencies stabilized)**

### 1. Explore vitest 4.x Features
- Review new features in vitest 4.0 release notes
- Identify opportunities to improve test performance
- Consider new configuration options or testing patterns
- Document any new capabilities that could benefit the project

### 2. Dependency Maintenance Automation
- Consider adding automated dependency update scheduling (e.g., Renovate, Dependabot)
- Configure automated checks for package maturity before auto-merge
- Set up alerts for security vulnerabilities with automated triage

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Monitor build times after vite 7.1.12 update
- Track test execution performance with vitest 4.x
- Document any performance improvements or regressions

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Update `docs/libraries/` if package behavior changes significantly
- Document any breaking changes encountered during vitest 4.x migration
- Record lessons learned from dependency maturity process

## Notes

**No Problems to Address**: All problems in `docs/problems/` are closed or resolved. No ITIL problem management process required at this time.

**Security Compliance**: Current approach complies with `docs/SECURITY-POLICY.md`:
- Low-severity vulnerabilities identified (fast-redact, pino)
- Fix available but too recent (0 days old)
- Acceptable to wait < 14 days for package maturity
- No formal security incident documentation required yet

**Gall's Law Compliance**: Waiting for stable packages before updating maintains system stability. Current system works; updates will be applied incrementally and carefully to avoid introducing instability.

**Assessment Status**: Next full assessment should run on 2025-10-31 after all packages have matured and been updated.
