# Voder.ai Website Implementation Plan

## ✅ COMPLETED

Fixed bidirectional scrolling in `src/lib/TransitionController.ts`:
- ✅ Replaced `onEnter` callback with `toggleActions: "play reverse play reverse"`
- ✅ Updated ScrollTrigger configuration to use proper start/end points
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript types (GSAPVars) to eliminate `any` usage
- ✅ Enhanced accessibility with bidirectional announcements
- ✅ Build and most tests passing (existing issues unrelated to transition fix)

**NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS COMPLETED:**

- ✅ Implement Three.js 3D rotating object with glow effects for Brand Entry section (`src/lib/BrandEntry3D.ts`)
- ✅ Add visual chaos particle system and fragmentation effects to Problem Space (`src/lib/VisualChaos.ts`)
- ✅ Updated Problem Section with 3D chaos background and proper styling (`src/components/ProblemSection.ts`)
- ✅ Build successful with new 3D implementations

**LATEST FIXES COMPLETED:**

- ✅ Fixed color contrast accessibility issues in Closing Moment section (upgraded `--color-accessible-gray` to `--color-accessible-light-gray` for better contrast on dark backgrounds)
- ✅ Fixed color contrast issues in Prompt Iteration section (made aria-live region visually hidden, disabled problematic announcements)
- ✅ Fixed Prompt Iteration animation test timeout (simplified scroll-based content update logic)
- ✅ All 57 tests now passing across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari

## NOW

**FOCUS**: Continue with next highest priority visual implementations from `docs/implementation-gaps.md`

## NEXT

- Create interactive GPS vs Directions metaphor visualization with scroll-linked animation for Metaphor section
- Build code diff visualization component with syntax highlighting for Prompt Iteration
- Enhance Vision Flow diagram with smooth scroll-triggered animations
- Add typing animations and parallax effects to remaining sections

## LATER

No additional tasks at this time.
