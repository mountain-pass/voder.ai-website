# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 19, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (87% Complete)  
**Current Status**: BLOCKED - Coverage threshold failure prevents new development

---

## NOW

**Fix Critical Coverage Threshold Failure**

**Immediate Action**: Resolve branch coverage failure that blocks all new development (88.23% < 90% required threshold).

**Why This is Critical**:
- Quality gate enforcement prevents starting new stories until resolved
- Coverage threshold exit code 1 blocks development workflow
- All other quality standards are met (linting, formatting, type checking, security)
- Project is otherwise ready for next story with excellent foundation

**Technical Actions Required**:
1. **Identify Missing Coverage**: Focus on `traffic-analytics.ts` lines 80, 300-307 (uncovered branches)
2. **Add Targeted Tests**: Write specific tests to cover missing branch conditions
3. **Verify Threshold**: Ensure `npm run test:coverage` passes without errors
4. **Validate Quality Gate**: Confirm branch coverage reaches 90%+ requirement

**Expected Outcome**:
- Branch coverage above 90% threshold
- All quality gates passing (lint ✅, format ✅, type-check ✅, test-coverage ✅)
- Ready to proceed with next story development
- Maintained 97.35% statement coverage excellence

**Time Estimate**: 1-2 hours to add missing test cases and verify coverage

**Complete Analytics Reporting Implementation**

Once coverage threshold is resolved, focus on completing the three partially implemented analytics stories:

**Analytics Stories Requiring Completion**:

1. **015.0-PO-ANALYTICS-PAGEVIEWS**: Complete reporting dashboard access
   - ✅ Microsoft Clarity tracking implemented
   - ❌ Missing: Accessible reporting dashboard for daily/weekly metrics
   - **Action**: Document Clarity dashboard access and provide reporting URLs

2. **016.0-PO-ANALYTICS-TRAFFIC**: Complete traffic source categorization reporting  
   - ✅ Basic traffic source tracking implemented
   - ❌ Missing: Automated source categorization and reporting system
   - **Action**: Enhance traffic source analysis and create reporting views

3. **018.0-PO-ANALYTICS-BOUNCE**: Complete bounce rate reporting
   - ✅ Bounce tracking logic implemented with comprehensive tests
   - ❌ Missing: Accessible bounce rate reports and dashboard
   - **Action**: Integrate bounce data with reporting system and provide access

**Project Completion Validation**:
- Verify all 23 stories meet acceptance criteria with concrete evidence
- Ensure 90%+ test coverage maintained for new implementations  
- Validate end-to-end functionality of complete analytics system
- Document analytics access for product owner use

**Expected Outcome**: 100% story completion (23/23 stories fully implemented)
