# Performance Issue Root Cause Validation Plan

## NOW

**Execute Experiment 1: Shader Complexity Hypothesis Validation**

Test if complex volumetric raymarching shader is the root cause of Mobile Chrome performance issues.

1. **Create performance mode environment variable**:
   - Add `PERFORMANCE_MODE=true` environment variable support
   - Modify `ThreeAnimation` to reduce shader complexity when enabled
   - Reduce raymarching steps from 40 to 10 when performance mode is active

2. **Run controlled E2E test comparison**:
   - Run failing Mobile Chrome tests with performance mode enabled
   - Measure execution time difference vs standard mode
   - Monitor for GPU stall reduction in test output

3. **Validate timeout configuration hierarchy**:
   - Temporarily increase global timeout to 60s in playwright.config.ts
   - Run failing tests to confirm if they complete in 30-45s window
   - This confirms whether timeout config or actual performance is the issue

## NEXT

**Execute Experiment 2: ReadPixels/Screenshot Operation Isolation**

Test if screenshot operations are triggering GPU stalls causing test failures.

1. **Create test variants without screenshots**:
   - Duplicate failing test cases but skip screenshot assertions
   - Run on Mobile Chrome to isolate screenshot impact
   - Compare execution times with/without screenshot operations

2. **Add WebGL performance timing**:
   - Instrument tests with WebGL operation timing
   - Log GPU memory usage during test execution
   - Compare performance metrics across browser types

**Execute Experiment 3: Feature Isolation Testing**

Progressively disable 3D features to isolate performance bottlenecks.

1. **Test with 3D completely disabled**: Add environment variable to disable WebGL entirely
2. **Test with basic cube only**: Remove caustics, keep simple cube rendering
3. **Test with caustics but no animation**: Static caustics without animation loops

## LATER

**Document experimental results and implement permanent solutions**

1. **Update problem document with experimental evidence**
2. **Implement adaptive performance scaling based on validated root causes**
3. **Create performance regression testing framework**
4. **Establish device capability detection for progressive enhancement**
