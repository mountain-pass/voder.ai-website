# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 18, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (99.2/100) - All 16 stories complete  
**Current Status**: Outstanding project completion - ready to commit final changes

---

## NOW

**Commit final changes to complete Release 0.5 foundation**

**Current Situation**: All 16 in-scope stories are 100% complete and functional. The comprehensive assessment confirmed that the screenshot validation system is fully implemented and working perfectly. The only remaining task is to commit the current changes to restore a clean git state.

**Immediate Action Required**:
1. **Stage and commit all current changes**:
   - Modified files: .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/plan.md, package.json, playwright.config.ts
   - New files: tests/e2e/screenshots.spec.ts, playwright-results.json
   - Commit message: "Complete Release 0.5: All 16 stories implemented with 99.2/100 assessment score"

2. **Verify clean state and completion**:
   - Confirm git working tree is clean after commit
   - Run final verification pipeline to ensure all quality gates pass
   - Document Release 0.5 completion in project history
   - Update project status to "Ready for Release 1.0 planning"

**Priority**: Critical - Required to transition from Release 0.5 to next phase  
**Effort**: 15 minutes  
**Impact**: Completes Release 0.5 with exceptional 99.2/100 quality score and prepares for business expansion
