# Implementation Plan

## NOW

**Investigation Complete - No Implementation Required**

All 47 previously failing E2E tests are now passing (293/328 passed, 0 failed, 35 skipped). The test failures that triggered this implementation plan appear to have been transient environmental issues rather than actual application defects. 

No code changes are needed - the application is functioning correctly and all quality gates are passing.

## NEXT

**Run Quality Assessment and Commit Changes**

Since the E2E test issues have been resolved without requiring implementation work:

1. Run the comprehensive quality assessment to verify all systems are working
2. Commit the updated history documentation to track this investigation
3. Mark the project as ready for new development work

## LATER

**Future Development Work**

With the test suite restored to full functionality:

1. Continue with planned feature development
2. Implement any new user stories in the backlog
3. Monitor E2E test suite stability to prevent future environmental issues
