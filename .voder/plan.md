# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 19, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (92% Complete)  
**Current Status**: BLOCKED - Critical readiness blockers prevent new development

---

## NOW

**Fix Test Coverage Thresholds and Commit Outstanding Changes**

**Immediate Action**: Resolve critical readiness blockers that prevent any new story development.

**Critical Blockers Identified**:
1. **Test Coverage Below Threshold**: 87.4% lines and 83.54% branches (requires 90%)
2. **Uncommitted Changes**: Modified `.voder/implementation-progress.md`
3. **Untracked Files**: New story file `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/019.0-PO-ANALYTICS-ENGAGEMENT.md`

**Why This is Critical**:
- `npm run verify` command fails due to coverage thresholds
- Assessment methodology requires NO uncommitted changes before new stories
- Project has excellent implementation (92% complete) but fails quality gates

**Specific Actions Required**:

**Step 1: Improve Test Coverage** (Primary Blocker)
- **Target Files**: `src/traffic-analytics.ts` (currently 86.36% lines, 82.87% branches)
- **Missing Coverage**: Lines 596, 607-634, 641-643 (error handling and edge cases)
- **Required**: Add tests for error scenarios, localStorage failures, API edge cases
- **Goal**: Reach 90% threshold for lines and branches to pass `npm run verify`

**Step 2: Clean Working Directory**
1. **Review changes**: `git diff` to confirm implementation-progress.md updates are correct
2. **Stage files**: `git add .voder/implementation-progress.md prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/019.0-PO-ANALYTICS-ENGAGEMENT.md`
3. **Commit**: `git commit -m "Update assessment and add engagement analytics story"`
4. **Push**: `git push origin main`
5. **Verify**: `git status` shows "working tree clean"

**Step 3: Validation**
- Run `npm run verify` and confirm it passes completely
- Verify all quality gates pass without coverage threshold failures
- Confirm working directory is clean with no uncommitted changes

**Expected Outcome**:
- Coverage above 90% threshold for all metrics
- Clean working directory with all changes committed and pushed
- `npm run verify` passes completely
- Ready for next story development

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours for test writing + 10 minutes for git operations

## NEXT

**Continue with Remaining Story Development**

Once critical blockers are resolved, focus on completing any remaining story requirements and quality improvements.

**Current Project Status After NOW**:
- **92% Complete**: Strong implementation quality with excellent foundation
- **Major Analytics Complete**: Page views, traffic sources, sessions, and bounce tracking implemented
- **Zero Security Vulnerabilities**: npm audit clean across all dependencies
- **Quality Infrastructure**: All linting, formatting, type checking, and git hooks working
- **Deployment Working**: Live site at https://voder.ai with functional analytics

**Immediate Next Actions**:

1. **Story Requirements Review**:
   - Systematically verify all acceptance criteria in 19+ implemented stories
   - Check for any gaps between requirements and implementation
   - Ensure all REQ-* requirements have concrete evidence
   - Document any remaining implementation needs

2. **Quality Maintenance**:
   - Monitor coverage stays above 90% threshold
   - Maintain zero security vulnerabilities through regular audits
   - Keep all quality gates passing (linting, formatting, type checking)
   - Ensure git hooks continue enforcing standards

3. **Production Validation**:
   - Verify https://voder.ai continues working correctly
   - Confirm Microsoft Clarity analytics tracking functional
   - Test all user interaction flows (engagement, bounce tracking)
   - Validate cross-browser compatibility

4. **Documentation Currency**:
   - Ensure README matches current implementation
   - Update any outdated setup instructions
   - Verify all npm scripts documented correctly
   - Maintain architecture decision records

**Implementation Standards**:
- All code changes must pass `npm run verify`
- Test coverage must remain above 90% for all metrics
- No security vulnerabilities in any dependencies
- Clean git working directory before starting new features

**Expected Outcome**: Robust, production-ready platform with high-quality codebase ready for business value delivery
