# Project Completion Plan

Based on the assessment report that identified critical blocking issues preventing new story development.

## NOW

**Fix Vercel Deployment Protection Configuration (Story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION)**

The immediate blocking issue is that `vercel.json` is missing the required deployment protection configuration that should integrate with GitHub Actions quality gates. This is preventing the completion of story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION.

**Specific Action Required:**
1. Add the deployment protection configuration to `vercel.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "github": {
       "deploymentStatus": "deployment_protection",
       "requiredStatusChecks": [
         "CI & Playwright multi-browser tests",
         "Deploy to Production",
         "Security Audit"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

2. Verify that the three required GitHub Actions workflows exist with correct names (they do, per assessment)
3. Test that Vercel waits for CI completion before deploying
4. Validate all 8 acceptance criteria for story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION are now satisfied
5. Update the traceability file to reflect VALIDATED status for all criteria

This must be completed before any other work can proceed, as the fail-fast assessment protocol identified invalidated acceptance criteria.

## NEXT

**Complete Systematic Story Validation**

After fixing the deployment protection issue:

1. **Re-run Full Assessment** - Execute the complete 4-phase assessment process to validate all 32 stories systematically (not just the blocking story 022.0)
2. **Process Remaining Stories** - Continue fail-fast reverse-order validation for stories 021.4 down to 001.0, creating individual traceability files for each
3. **Resolve Additional Issues** - Fix any other invalidated or unvalidated acceptance criteria discovered during full assessment
4. **Validate All Quality Gates** - Ensure builds, tests, linting, security scans, and deployment processes all pass
5. **Confirm Zero Technical Debt** - Verify no incomplete implementations, missing tests, or failing quality checks remain

## LATER

**Prepare for Next Release Cycle**

Once all current stories are validated as complete:

1. **Release 0.5 Completion** - Mark Release 0.5 as complete with all 32 stories validated
2. **Next Release Planning** - Plan and prioritize stories for Release 0.6 based on founder validation feedback
3. **Process Improvements** - Refine the assessment and validation processes based on lessons learned
4. **Standards Evolution** - Update architectural decision records based on production experience
5. **Foundation Scaling** - Prepare infrastructure and processes for expanded founder validation testing

**Note:** No new story development should begin until the assessment confirms all current work is complete with zero invalidated or unvalidated acceptance criteria.
