# Implementation Plan

## NOW

**Implement basic scroll-linked cube rotation functionality**

Enable the most minimal scroll-to-rotation mapping in `src/three-animation.ts`:

1. **Uncomment and fix the scroll rotation code** in the `addScrollInteraction()` method (lines 335-360)
2. **Implement simple Y-axis rotation mapping**: Map scroll position directly to cube rotation using `this.cube.rotation.y = scrollProgress * rotationMultiplier`
3. **Set rotation multiplier**: Use `0.005` radians per pixel for desktop (as specified in the requirements)
4. **Enable the scroll interaction**: Uncomment the call to `this.addScrollInteraction()` in the `initThreeJS()` method (line 169)
5. **Test basic functionality**: Verify that scrolling down rotates the cube left and scrolling up rotates right

**Key changes needed**:
- Replace `this.cube.rotation.z = scrollProgress * Math.PI * 0.25;` with `this.cube.rotation.y = scrollProgress * 0.005 * window.scrollY;`
- Remove the commenting out of the rotation code block
- Ensure scroll events are properly throttled with the existing `requestAnimationFrame` approach

This creates the minimal working implementation where the cube rotates in response to scroll position.

## NEXT

**Enhance and optimize the scroll rotation implementation**

1. **Add responsive rotation sensitivity**: Implement different rotation multipliers for mobile (0.003) vs desktop (0.005) based on viewport width detection
2. **Improve performance**: Ensure scroll events use proper throttling and `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps rendering
3. **Add bidirectional control**: Verify that scroll direction changes immediately reverse rotation direction
4. **Cross-device compatibility**: Test and optimize for mouse wheel, trackpad, and mobile touch scroll inputs
5. **Visual continuity**: Ensure glass material properties and lighting are maintained during rotation
6. **Memory management**: Add proper cleanup of scroll event listeners in the `destroy()` method

## LATER

**Complete remaining user stories and enhancements**

1. **025.1-BIZ-FOUC-PREVENTION**: Implement FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content) prevention for smooth loading experience
2. **025.0-BIZ-3D-ANIMATION enhancements**: Add any missing 3D animation features identified during development
3. **Release 0.5 story completion**: Work through any remaining development tooling, analytics, or deployment stories
4. **Performance optimization**: Fine-tune loading performance, Core Web Vitals, and rendering optimizations
5. **Cross-browser testing**: Comprehensive testing across all supported browsers and devices
6. **User experience polish**: Refine interaction timing, easing curves, and visual feedback for optimal user experience
