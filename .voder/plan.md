# Implementation Plan# Implementation Plan



Based on the assessment that identified **BLOCKED BY DEPENDENCIES** status, this plan follows Gall's Law by starting with the simplest possible fix and follows ITIL problem management for systematic resolution.## NOW



## NOW**Resolve P003: Coming Soon Button Overlapping 3D Cube (Priority 7 - High)**



**Update Critical Dependencies to Unblock Development**Follow ITIL problem management process:



Perform a targeted dependency update focusing on security and stability fixes first:1. **Complete Root Cause Analysis** for P003

   - Problem is already identified: CSS negative margin (`margin: 0 0 -100vh`) in `.hero-animation` pulls content up over the 3D canvas

1. **Update patch versions first** (lowest risk):   - The `hero-animation` div (3D canvas container) is positioned before the text content in HTML, but uses negative margin to overlay text on top

   ```bash   - Layout creates visual overlap where "Coming Soon" button appears directly over 3D cube

   npm update @eslint/js @playwright/test tsx vite

   ```2. **Create Failing Test** 

   - Write Playwright E2E test that verifies button and 3D cube don't overlap

2. **Update TypeScript tooling** (development dependencies):   - Test should check z-index stacking and visual positioning

   ```bash   - Confirm test fails with current layout (reproduces the problem)

   npm update @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser

   ```3. **Implement Targeted Workaround**

   - Based on root cause: Adjust CSS layout to prevent overlap

3. **Update build tools** (proven stable):   - Simple solution: Modify `.hero-animation` positioning to create proper separation

   ```bash   - Remove negative margin and adjust layout to position 3D cube as true background

   npm update htmlhint jiti netlify-cli   - Ensure text content has proper vertical spacing above the 3D canvas

   ```

4. **Transition to Known Error Status**

4. **Verify the updates work**:   - Move P003 from `.open.md` to `.known-error.md`

   ```bash   - Document workaround implementation

   npm run build   - Create INVEST-compliant story for permanent design solution

   npm run test:unit

   npm run lint:check## NEXT

   ```

**Clean Up Problem Management System**

5. **Commit the working state**:

   ```bash1. **Resolve Duplicate Problem Files**

   git add package.json package-lock.json   - Remove duplicate `.open.md` files for problems already in `.known-error.md` status

   git commit -m "deps: update critical dependencies for security and stability"   - Keep only the `.known-error.md` versions for:

   ```     - `mobile-3d-cube-size-jump-scroll.known-error.md` (delete .open.md)

     - `text-flash-before-3d-render.known-error.md` (delete .open.md)

This provides the minimum viable dependency update to unblock development while maintaining system stability.   - Ensures single source of truth for problem status



## NEXT2. **Implement P003 Permanent Fix** 

   - Create proper design system for hero section layout

**Evaluate and Update Major Version Dependencies**   - Implement clean CSS Grid or Flexbox solution that naturally separates content

   - Replace hacky negative margin approach with intentional layout design

After confirming the core system works with patch updates:   - Re-enable and verify P003 test passes



1. **Research breaking changes** for major version updates:3. **Complete Project Quality Gates**

   - eslint-plugin-unicorn (60→61)   - Ensure all tests pass with layout fixes

   - happy-dom (18→19)    - Verify code coverage remains >80%

   - jest-axe (9→10)   - Confirm no new linting or formatting issues

   - jsdom (26→27)   - Validate responsive design across all device sizes



2. **Update one major dependency at a time**:## LATER

   ```bash

   npm update eslint-plugin-unicorn**Future Enhancements and Monitoring**

   npm run test:unit  # verify compatibility

   npm run lint:check  # verify linting still works1. **Design System Foundation**

   ```   - Establish consistent spacing and layout patterns

   - Create reusable CSS components for hero sections

3. **Fix any breaking changes** encountered:   - Document layout best practices to prevent similar issues

   - Update configuration files if needed

   - Adjust test code for API changes2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Update TypeScript types if required   - Monitor 3D animation performance metrics

   - Optimize Three.js initialization for faster load times

4. **Repeat for each major version update** with testing between each   - Consider progressive enhancement strategies



5. **Consider Node.js types update**:3. **User Experience Improvements**

   - Evaluate @types/node (22→24) compatibility with current Node.js version   - A/B test different button positions and styles

   - Update only if current Node.js supports the new types   - Analyze user engagement with coming soon CTA

   - Gather feedback on 3D animation effectiveness

## LATER

4. **Preventive Measures**

**System Optimization and Maintenance**   - Add automated visual regression testing

   - Implement design system governance

After all dependencies are current and stable:   - Create layout validation rules in CI/CD pipeline

1. **Consider npm update**:
   - Evaluate upgrading npm from 10.9.2 to 11.6.1
   - Test with development workflow first
   - Update globally if no compatibility issues

2. **Dependency audit and cleanup**:
   - Review unused dependencies
   - Consolidate duplicate functionality
   - Optimize bundle size

3. **Automated dependency monitoring**:
   - Set up automated dependency update PRs
   - Configure security vulnerability scanning
   - Establish regular dependency review schedule

4. **Documentation updates**:
   - Update development setup instructions
   - Document dependency update procedures
   - Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
