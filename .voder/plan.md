# Implementation Plan

## NOW

**Fix Security Vulnerabilities in Dependencies**

The assessment identified security vulnerabilities in the `fast-redact` package that are blocking new story development. The current package.json override specifies a non-existent version (`^3.6.0`). 

**Immediate Actions**:

1. **Update package.json override configuration**: 
   - Change `fast-redact` override from `^3.6.0` to `^3.5.0` (latest available version)
   - Verify the override addresses the vulnerability properly

2. **Apply npm audit fix**:
   - Run `npm audit fix` to resolve the 2 low severity vulnerabilities
   - Verify the fix resolves the fast-redact prototype pollution issue

3. **Clean reinstall dependencies**:
   - Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
   - Run `npm install` to ensure override takes effect
   - Verify `npm audit` shows zero vulnerabilities

4. **Validate the fix**:
   - Run `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` to confirm no security issues
   - Test that netlify-cli functionality still works for deployment
   - Run `npm run verify` to ensure all checks pass

## NEXT

**Complete Project Quality Verification**

After resolving security vulnerabilities:

1. **Run comprehensive build and test validation**:
   - Execute `npm run build` to ensure production build works
   - Run `npm run test:ci` to verify all tests pass with good coverage
   - Execute `npm run lint:check` and `npm run format:check` for code quality

2. **Commit security fixes**:
   - Stage the package.json and package-lock.json changes
   - Commit with clear message about security vulnerability resolution
   - Push changes to trigger CI/CD pipeline validation

## LATER

**Resume Normal Development Workflow**

Once security issues are resolved and quality checks pass:

1. **Monitor dependency security**: 
   - Set up periodic review of `npm audit` results
   - Track if fast-redact package maintainer releases security patches

2. **Maintain development quality standards**:
   - Continue following existing test coverage requirements (96.91% maintained)
   - Keep up with dependency updates through regular `npm outdated` checks
   - Ensure CI/CD pipeline continues passing all quality gates

3. **Development readiness**:
   - Project will be ready for new story implementation
   - All existing functionality preserved and working
   - Quality standards maintained at current excellent levels
