# Implementation Plan

## NOW

**Fix the failing E2E analytics test that's blocking the assessment**

The test `tracks analytics events on form submission` in `tests/e2e/closing-moment.spec.ts` is timing out after 30 seconds. This is the critical blocking issue preventing any new development work. The test is trying to validate that analytics events are properly tracked when a user submits the email form, but it's timing out on line 171.

**Root cause analysis indicates**:
- The test is attempting to intercept and validate Microsoft Clarity analytics calls
- The analytics initialization or event tracking may be taking longer than expected
- The test is browser-specific (only runs on Chromium, skips Firefox and WebKit)

**Immediate fix approach**:
1. Increase the test timeout from 30s to 60s for this specific test
2. Add more robust waiting mechanisms for analytics initialization
3. Add fallback detection for when analytics is not available
4. Consider mocking the analytics completely to make the test more reliable

This resolves the immediate blocking issue so development can continue.

## NEXT

**Address the three known error problems that have targeted workarounds ready**

1. **Implement targeted workaround for 3D cube performance issues (Problem 009)**
   - Add performance monitoring to detect slow devices
   - Implement automatic cube disabling for devices with poor performance
   - Add user preference toggle to disable animations
   - This addresses the Priority 9 (Critical) performance degradation

2. **Fix incomplete quality gates (Problem 010)**
   - Add markdown, CSS, and HTML linting to the `verify` script
   - Update pre-commit hooks to include all available linting checks
   - Ensure all `lint:*` scripts from package.json are included in automated gates
   - This addresses the Priority 6 (High) quality enforcement gaps

3. **Implement E2E tests in CI pipeline (Problem 011)**
   - Add E2E test execution to the CI/CD workflow
   - Configure proper test environment setup for CI
   - Add E2E test reporting and failure handling
   - This addresses the Priority 9 (Critical) deployment validation gap
