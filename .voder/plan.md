Fix the 3 critical E2E test failures that are blocking development:Implement **Targeted Post-Deployment** validation to achieve the "Post-deployment validation uses single browser (Chromium) with minimal essential tests only" acceptance criteria.



### Fix 1: Mobile Cube Resize Test Timeout**Current Issue**: Post-deployment validation is running a comprehensive E2E suite (10m10s runtime) instead of minimal smoke tests.

**Problem**: `[chromium] › Mobile 3D Cube Size Jump Prevention › should not change cube size on mobile scroll` - Test timeout (30000ms exceeded) with canvas locator timeout during mobile scroll testing.

**Action Required**: 

**Root Cause Analysis**: The test is trying to locate a canvas element that may not be rendered or visible in the mobile viewport during scroll operations. The 3D animation may be disabled due to performance concerns on mobile, making the canvas unavailable.1. Create a separate, minimal smoke test suite for post-deployment validation

2. Focus on essential functionality only: page loads, form exists, no JavaScript errors

**Implementation**:3. Run on Chromium only (no cross-browser testing in post-deployment)

1. Add conditional logic to check if 3D animation is enabled before testing canvas interactions4. Target <2 minute execution time vs current 10+ minutes

2. Update the test to handle the case where 3D animation is disabled on mobile due to performance

3. Add proper wait conditions for canvas element availability## NEXT

4. Increase timeout or add retry logic for mobile-specific scenarios

Optimize E2E test efficiency:

### Fix 2: WebKit Analytics Tracking Failure  1. **Replace waitForTimeout calls** - Remove inefficient `page.waitForTimeout(500)` calls throughout E2E suite and replace with proper element waits

**Problem**: `[webkit] › bounce tracking is initialized correctly` - Traffic source tracking initialization failure with console message assertion failed.2. **Review test scope** - Ensure pre-deployment E2E tests focus on essential functionality for a landing page with contact form

3. **Implement parallel cross-browser testing** - Run focused E2E tests across browsers in parallel during main pipeline

**Root Cause Analysis**: WebKit browser environment may have different timing for analytics initialization or different console message formatting compared to Chromium.

## LATER

**Implementation**:

1. Review console message timing and format differences in WebKit**Performance Optimization**:

2. Add browser-specific wait conditions for analytics initialization- Implement intelligent test parallelization to reduce overall CI time

3. Update assertion to handle WebKit-specific console message patterns- Add test result caching for unchanged components

4. Ensure analytics script loading is complete before checking initialization- Optimize E2E test selector strategies for faster execution



### Fix 3: Mobile Safari Analytics Tracking Failure## NEXT

**Problem**: `[Mobile Safari] › bounce tracking is initialized correctly` - Traffic source tracking initialization failure with console message assertion failed.

After fixing the immediate test failure:

**Root Cause Analysis**: Similar to WebKit but specifically for Mobile Safari environment, which may have additional mobile-specific behaviors or restrictions.

1. **Optimize E2E Test Performance**: The post-deployment tests are still taking 9+ minutes which is excessive for a simple landing page validation. The current approach runs too many comprehensive tests for post-deployment validation.

**Implementation**:

1. Add Mobile Safari-specific handling for analytics initialization2. **Replace waitForTimeout Calls**: Remove inefficient `page.waitForTimeout(500)` calls throughout the E2E test suite and replace with proper element waits to improve test reliability and speed.

2. Review if mobile browser restrictions affect analytics loading

3. Update test to account for mobile-specific timing differences3. **Implement Proper Test Scope**: Ensure post-deployment tests only validate critical functionality (page loads, form exists, no major JavaScript errors) rather than comprehensive cross-browser testing.

4. Ensure proper mobile viewport and device simulation

Long-term improvements:

### Verify Cross-Browser Compatibility

- Run the fixed tests across all browsers (Chromium, WebKit, Mobile Safari) to ensure consistency1. **Separate Comprehensive Testing**: Move comprehensive cross-browser testing to a separate workflow that runs on a schedule rather than blocking deployments.

- Update any remaining browser-specific edge cases discovered during testing

- Ensure all 296 tests achieve 100% pass rate2. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement monitoring to ensure the optimized pipeline stays under 10 minutes total execution time.



### Performance Optimization Validation3. **Test Architecture Review**: Review the overall E2E testing strategy to ensure tests are appropriately scoped for different pipeline stages (pre-deployment critical tests vs post-deployment smoke tests vs comprehensive validation).
- Verify that the mobile cube resize fix doesn't impact 3D animation performance decisions
- Ensure analytics tracking works efficiently across all browser environments
- Confirm that test fixes don't introduce new performance regressions

## LATER

### E2E Test Infrastructure Improvements
- Review timeout configurations across the entire E2E test suite for mobile scenarios
- Implement more robust waiting strategies for dynamic content like 3D animations
- Add better error handling and debugging information for cross-browser test failures

### Mobile-Specific Test Coverage Enhancement  
- Expand mobile device simulation coverage for various screen sizes and performance profiles
- Add more comprehensive mobile interaction testing beyond scroll scenarios
- Implement progressive enhancement testing for cases where 3D features are disabled

### Analytics Tracking Robustness
- Enhance analytics initialization detection across different browser environments
- Add fallback mechanisms for analytics functionality in restricted browser contexts
- Implement more comprehensive analytics event tracking validation
