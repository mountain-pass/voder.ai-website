# Project Plan

**Updated**: January 20, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (96% Complete)  
**Current Status**: BLOCKED - Git blockers prevent new development

---

## NOW

**Commit Outstanding Changes to Resolve Git Blockers**

**Immediate Action**: Resolve critical git blockers that prevent any new story development.

**Critical Blockers Identified**:
1. **Modified Assessment**: `.voder/implementation-progress.md` (this assessment file)
2. **Untracked Story**: `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/021.0-BIZ-CLOSING-MOMENT.md`

**Why This is Critical**:
- Assessment methodology requires NO uncommitted changes before new stories
- Project shows outstanding completion (96%) with high-quality implementation
- All technical requirements met: 97/97 tests passing, 95.98% coverage, 0 security vulnerabilities
- Only git repository state preventing next story development

**Specific Actions Required**:

**Step 1: Review and Commit Assessment**
1. **Review assessment**: Verify `.voder/implementation-progress.md` contains accurate assessment results
2. **Stage assessment**: `git add .voder/implementation-progress.md`
3. **Commit assessment**: `git commit -m "Complete systematic implementation progress assessment"`

**Step 2: Evaluate New Story**
1. **Review story file**: `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/021.0-BIZ-CLOSING-MOMENT.md`
2. **Determine readiness**: Assess if story is ready for implementation or needs removal
3. **Decision**: Either `git add` and commit OR `rm` the untracked file
4. **If committing**: `git commit -m "Add closing moment story for business validation"`
5. **If removing**: `rm prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/021.0-BIZ-CLOSING-MOMENT.md`

**Step 3: Finalize Repository State**
- **Push changes**: `git push origin main`
- **Verify clean state**: Confirm `git status` shows "working tree clean"
- **Quality check**: Run `npm run verify` to ensure all gates pass

**Expected Outcome**:
- Clean working directory with no uncommitted changes
- All files properly tracked and synchronized with origin
- Ready for immediate next story development
- Maintained 96% project completion with excellent technical foundation

**Time Estimate**: 10-15 minutes for review and git operations
**Current Project Excellence**:
- ✅ **26+ Stories Implemented**: All core functionality complete with concrete evidence
- ✅ **Testing Excellence**: 97/97 unit tests + 21/21 E2E tests passing, 95.98% coverage
- ✅ **Zero Security Issues**: Clean npm audit across all dependencies
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Build system optimized with sub-400ms builds
- ✅ **Quality Infrastructure**: All linting, formatting, type checking enforced
