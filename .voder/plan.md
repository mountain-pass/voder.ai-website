**Implement workaround for Text Flash Before 3D Render (Priority 9 - Critical)**Firstly, delete any existing #file:.voder/plan.md file to ensure a fresh plan.



Following ITIL problem management process, implement the quickest, simplest workaround to eliminate the jarring text flash that affects 100% of users on first page load.Then create a new #file:.voder/plan.md based on what we should do to complete the implementation of the software project.



### Workaround Strategy: Hide Text Content Initially (Option 1)Make sure you follow Gall's Law: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked."

This is the simplest implementation that could possibly work - pure CSS solution with minimal risk.

So, start with the simplest possible implementation that could possibly work, then iterate and improve it.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Modify CSS** in `src/style.css`:**CRITICAL PROCESS REQUIREMENT**: For any open problems identified in the assessment, you MUST follow the ITIL problem management process as defined in #file:../../docs/PROBLEM-MANAGEMENT.md:

   - Add CSS rule to hide hero text content until 3D system is ready

   - Use opacity transition for smooth loading experience1. **Implement workarounds FIRST** - You don't "fix" problems directly. You implement workarounds to mitigate impact immediately.

   ```css2. **Then conduct root cause analysis** - Use structured techniques (5 Whys, fishbone, timeline analysis)

   .hero-title, .hero-description, .status-indicator {3. **Create failing tests** that reproduce the problem

     opacity: 0;4. **Transition problems to known-error status** when workaround is implemented and root cause identified

     transition: opacity 0.3s ease;5. **Create INVEST-compliant stories** for permanent fixes

   }6. **Finally implement permanent fixes** through normal development process

   

   .js-loaded .hero-title,Use the following the now-next-later template:

   .js-loaded .hero-description, 

   .js-loaded .status-indicator {```

     opacity: 1;## NOW

   }

   ```The single action to do now - detailed



2. **Verify workaround** - Test that:## NEXT

   - No text flash occurs on page load

   - Text appears smoothly after 3D system initializesThe actions to take, if any, after the action in the "NOW" section - less detailed. This MUST not contain story validation, acceptance criteria validation, traceability work, or assessment work - only actual implementation work to fix issues and complete the project.

   - Fallback works when JavaScript is disabled (progressive enhancement)

## LATER

3. **Document workaround** in the problem file:

   - Implementation steps and files modifiedThe actions to take, if any, after we've done everything in "Now" and "Next" - Future work - high level. This MUST not contain story validation, acceptance criteria validation, traceability work, or assessment work - only actual implementation work to fix issues and complete the project.

   - Limitations (blank space during loading)```

   - Business impact (improved first impression)

   - Rollback procedure (remove CSS rules)**CRITICAL**: Do not plan to do further assessments, traceability, or validation work - we are done with those. The plan should only contain actual implementation work to fix issues and complete the project. No acceptance criteria validation, no story validation, no assessment work should be included in the plan.


**Success Criteria:**
- Text content does not appear before 3D cube renders
- Smooth opacity transition when content appears
- No layout shifts during loading
- Works across all browsers and devices

**Implement workaround for Mobile 3D Cube Size Jump on Scroll (Priority 6 - High)**

Following ITIL process, implement feature-disabling workaround as the safest approach for this complex mobile viewport issue.

### Workaround Strategy: Disable Resize Handling on Mobile (Option 1)
Simple approach that prevents the problematic resize behavior while maintaining 3D functionality.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Modify 3D animation system** in `src/three-animation.ts`:
   - Add mobile detection in resize handler
   - Skip resize handling on mobile devices to prevent size jumps
   ```javascript
   private handleResize(): void {
     // Skip resize handling on mobile to prevent size jumps
     if (this.getDeviceType() === 'mobile') {
       return;
     }
     // ... existing resize logic for desktop/tablet
   }
   ```

2. **Skip related tests** temporarily:
   - Disable E2E tests that verify mobile resize behavior
   - Exclude mobile resize code from coverage reports
   - Document which tests are skipped in problem file

3. **Document workaround** with:
   - Implementation details and modified files
   - Limitations (no orientation change handling on mobile)
   - Monitoring requirements
   - Test skip documentation

**Alternative if needed:**
- Implement Option 2 (Debounce Resize Events) if mobile detection approach has issues
- Or Option 3 (Fixed Dimensions) as backup strategy

### Root Cause Analysis for Both Problems
1. **Create failing tests** that reproduce each problem:
   - E2E test for text flash detection
   - E2E test for mobile scroll size jump behavior

2. **Conduct structured analysis**:
   - 5 Whys analysis for text flash timing issue
   - Timeline analysis for mobile viewport behavior during scroll

3. **Transition problems to known-error status** when:
   - Workarounds are implemented and tested
   - Root causes are identified and documented
   - Failing tests are created

## LATER

**Create permanent fix stories and implement solutions**

After workarounds are in place and problems are in known-error status:

### Text Flash Permanent Fix
1. **Create INVEST-compliant story** for proper loading state management:
   - Implement sophisticated loading states
   - Add smooth transitions between loading phases
   - Optimize 3D initialization timing

2. **Implement permanent solution**:
   - Preload 3D system during page lifecycle
   - Implement proper content orchestration
   - Add loading indicators for professional UX

### Mobile Scroll Permanent Fix
1. **Create INVEST-compliant story** for mobile viewport handling:
   - Proper mobile browser viewport change detection
   - Sophisticated scroll event debouncing
   - Mobile-specific 3D optimization

2. **Implement permanent solution**:
   - Advanced mobile viewport behavior handling
   - Scroll-independent sizing system
   - Enhanced mobile user experience

### Feature Enhancement (Low Priority)
1. **Scroll-linked cube rotation** (if story 025.2 comes into scope):
   - Build on stable 3D foundation
   - Add scroll interaction capabilities
   - Implement performance optimizations

2. **Advanced 3D features**:
   - Enhanced lighting and materials
   - Animation system improvements
   - Cross-device optimization

### Technical Debt Resolution
1. **Testing infrastructure improvements**:
   - Enhanced mobile testing capabilities
   - Visual regression test optimization
   - Performance monitoring integration

2. **Code architecture refinement**:
   - 3D system modularization
   - Enhanced error handling
   - Documentation improvements
