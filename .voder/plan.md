Fix the Mobile Chrome E2E test failure for "Brand Entry - desktop (1920x1080)" caused by race condition in 3D animation initialization.



**Root Cause Analysis**: ## NOW

- The test expects a canvas element to be visible when `hasCanvas` is true

- However, Mobile Chrome's performance monitoring is inconsistently disabling 3D animation

- The animation system decides between canvas (3D) and fallback (2D) based on performance metrics

- Race condition exists between performance monitoring completion and test assertion**Fix Problem 011 Status Inconsistency**: Update the status of problem `011-missing-e2e-tests-in-ci-pipeline.open.md` from "OPEN" to "CLOSED" since the resolution section clearly documents that E2E tests are already properly integrated in the CI pipeline. The problem was based on an incorrect assumption and the investigation findings show:## NOW## NOW



**Immediate Fix**: Update the test logic in `tests/e2e/screenshots.spec.ts` to handle the case where performance monitoring disables the 3D animation after canvas creation but before visibility check. The test should accept either canvas OR fallback as valid states, not enforce canvas visibility when `hasCanvas` is true but performance monitoring has kicked in.



**Implementation**:1. Pre-deployment E2E validation exists (`npm run e2e:ci` in quality gates job)

1. Modify the assertion logic in the Brand Entry test to be more flexible

2. Change from strict canvas visibility requirement to accepting either animation state2. CI configuration includes Playwright dependencies installation

3. Add proper timing buffer for performance monitoring to complete before checking animation state

4. Update test to validate animation container exists rather than specific canvas visibility3. Post-deployment validation is implemented (`npm run e2e:ci:prod`)Fix the 3 critical E2E test failures that are blocking development:Implement **Targeted Post-Deployment** validation to achieve the "Post-deployment validation uses single browser (Chromium) with minimal essential tests only" acceptance criteria.



## NEXT4. E2E test failures properly block deployment through job dependencies



Add performance monitoring stabilization to prevent future test flakiness:

1. Increase the stabilization wait time in screenshot tests from 4000ms to 6000ms

2. Add performance override parameter to force 3D mode in tests when neededThis is a simple status update to align the file status with the documented resolution, removing a false blocking issue from the project.

3. Create helper function to wait for animation state to stabilize before assertions

### Fix 1: Mobile Cube Resize Test Timeout**Current Issue**: Post-deployment validation is running a comprehensive E2E suite (10m10s runtime) instead of minimal smoke tests.

Consider architectural improvements to the 3D animation system:

1. Make performance monitoring decisions more deterministic for testing**Problem**: `[chromium] › Mobile 3D Cube Size Jump Prevention › should not change cube size on mobile scroll` - Test timeout (30000ms exceeded) with canvas locator timeout during mobile scroll testing.

2. Add explicit test mode that bypasses performance monitoring

3. Improve performance monitoring algorithm to be less sensitive to CI environment variations**Address Problem 012 - CI Pipeline Performance Optimization**: Implement targeted optimizations for the slow CI/CD deployment pipeline that's taking 40-75 minutes instead of the target 5-15 minutes. Based on the problem analysis, focus on:

4. Consider splitting canvas creation from performance monitoring to reduce race conditions
**Action Required**: 

1. **E2E Test Suite Optimization**: The problem indicates E2E tests are the primary bottleneck. Optimize Playwright configuration:

   - Review and optimize browser configurations (currently running on Chromium, WebKit, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari)**Root Cause Analysis**: The test is trying to locate a canvas element that may not be rendered or visible in the mobile viewport during scroll operations. The 3D animation may be disabled due to performance concerns on mobile, making the canvas unavailable.1. Create a separate, minimal smoke test suite for post-deployment validation

   - Optimize wait strategies to replace inefficient `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` patterns

   - Remove or reduce fixed timeout calls (`waitForTimeout()`)2. Focus on essential functionality only: page loads, form exists, no JavaScript errors

   - Implement test parallelization improvements

**Implementation**:3. Run on Chromium only (no cross-browser testing in post-deployment)

2. **Pipeline Job Optimization**: Review `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to identify other potential bottlenecks beyond E2E testing

1. Add conditional logic to check if 3D animation is enabled before testing canvas interactions4. Target <2 minute execution time vs current 10+ minutes

3. **Selective Test Execution**: Consider implementing smart test selection for deployment gates vs. full test suites

2. Update the test to handle the case where 3D animation is disabled on mobile due to performance

## LATER

3. Add proper wait conditions for canvas element availability## NEXT

**Performance Monitoring and Continuous Improvement**: After the immediate pipeline optimization:

4. Increase timeout or add retry logic for mobile-specific scenarios

1. **Pipeline Metrics Dashboard**: Implement monitoring for CI/CD pipeline performance to track DORA metrics and prevent regression

2. **Advanced Test Optimization**: Further optimize 3D WebGL performance tests and visual regression testingOptimize E2E test efficiency:

3. **Infrastructure Scaling**: Evaluate GitHub Actions runner configurations and potential for test sharding across multiple jobs

### Fix 2: WebKit Analytics Tracking Failure  1. **Replace waitForTimeout calls** - Remove inefficient `page.waitForTimeout(500)` calls throughout E2E suite and replace with proper element waits

**Note**: All assessment, validation, and traceability work has been completed. This plan focuses only on fixing the identified blocking problems to enable continued development velocity.
**Problem**: `[webkit] › bounce tracking is initialized correctly` - Traffic source tracking initialization failure with console message assertion failed.2. **Review test scope** - Ensure pre-deployment E2E tests focus on essential functionality for a landing page with contact form

3. **Implement parallel cross-browser testing** - Run focused E2E tests across browsers in parallel during main pipeline

**Root Cause Analysis**: WebKit browser environment may have different timing for analytics initialization or different console message formatting compared to Chromium.

## LATER

**Implementation**:

1. Review console message timing and format differences in WebKit**Performance Optimization**:

2. Add browser-specific wait conditions for analytics initialization- Implement intelligent test parallelization to reduce overall CI time

3. Update assertion to handle WebKit-specific console message patterns- Add test result caching for unchanged components

4. Ensure analytics script loading is complete before checking initialization- Optimize E2E test selector strategies for faster execution



### Fix 3: Mobile Safari Analytics Tracking Failure## NEXT

**Problem**: `[Mobile Safari] › bounce tracking is initialized correctly` - Traffic source tracking initialization failure with console message assertion failed.

After fixing the immediate test failure:

**Root Cause Analysis**: Similar to WebKit but specifically for Mobile Safari environment, which may have additional mobile-specific behaviors or restrictions.

1. **Optimize E2E Test Performance**: The post-deployment tests are still taking 9+ minutes which is excessive for a simple landing page validation. The current approach runs too many comprehensive tests for post-deployment validation.

**Implementation**:

1. Add Mobile Safari-specific handling for analytics initialization2. **Replace waitForTimeout Calls**: Remove inefficient `page.waitForTimeout(500)` calls throughout the E2E test suite and replace with proper element waits to improve test reliability and speed.

2. Review if mobile browser restrictions affect analytics loading

3. Update test to account for mobile-specific timing differences3. **Implement Proper Test Scope**: Ensure post-deployment tests only validate critical functionality (page loads, form exists, no major JavaScript errors) rather than comprehensive cross-browser testing.

4. Ensure proper mobile viewport and device simulation

Long-term improvements:

### Verify Cross-Browser Compatibility

- Run the fixed tests across all browsers (Chromium, WebKit, Mobile Safari) to ensure consistency1. **Separate Comprehensive Testing**: Move comprehensive cross-browser testing to a separate workflow that runs on a schedule rather than blocking deployments.

- Update any remaining browser-specific edge cases discovered during testing

- Ensure all 296 tests achieve 100% pass rate2. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement monitoring to ensure the optimized pipeline stays under 10 minutes total execution time.



### Performance Optimization Validation3. **Test Architecture Review**: Review the overall E2E testing strategy to ensure tests are appropriately scoped for different pipeline stages (pre-deployment critical tests vs post-deployment smoke tests vs comprehensive validation).
- Verify that the mobile cube resize fix doesn't impact 3D animation performance decisions
- Ensure analytics tracking works efficiently across all browser environments
- Confirm that test fixes don't introduce new performance regressions
