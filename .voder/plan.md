# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 18, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (94.75/100) - 16 of 17 stories complete  
**Current Status**: Excellent project quality - deployment story and git cleanup needed

---

## NOW

**Complete assessment fixes and add deployment story to git tracking**

**Current Situation**: The recent assessment revealed 16 of 17 stories are complete (94.75/100). A new deployment story (014.0-DEV-DEPLOY) was discovered but is unimplemented. Assessment also applied quality fixes that need to be committed.

**Immediate Action Required**:
1. **Stage and commit assessment fixes**:
   - Modified files: README.md, docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md, src/style.css, .voder/implementation-progress.md
   - Commit message: "fix: apply quality improvements from comprehensive assessment"

2. **Track the deployment story**:
   - Stage the untracked file: prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/014.0-DEV-DEPLOY.md
   - Commit message: "feat: add deployment story for static site hosting requirements"

3. **Verify clean git state**:
   - Confirm git working tree is clean after commits
   - Run verification pipeline to ensure all quality gates still pass

**Priority**: Critical - Required to restore clean git state and accurate project tracking  
**Effort**: 10 minutes  
**Impact**: Restores clean development state and accurate story portfolio tracking
