**Fix CI workflow pnpm setup error that's causing deployment protection failure**Debug and fix the current Vercel deployment failures that are causing production deployments to show "Error" status. Investigate the root cause by:



The CI workflow is failing with "No pnpm version is specified" error (exit code 4), which is preventing the deployment protection from working correctly. The GitHub Actions workflow needs to specify the pnpm version either in the workflow config or package.json packageManager field. 1. Checking Vercel deployment logs for the failed deployments using `vercel logs <deployment-url>`



Current evidence shows:2. Reviewing the build command `npm run deploy:check` that runs `npm run verify && npm run screenshots` to identify which step is failingDebug and fix the current Vercel deployment failures that are causing production deployments to show "Error" status. Investigate the root cause by:

- CI workflow failing with pnpm setup error

- This failure should block deployments but isn't3. Testing the build pipeline locally to reproduce the deployment issue

- Need to add pnpm version specification to fix the workflow

4. Fixing any issues found in the build process, dependencies, or configuration1. Checking Vercel deployment logs for the failed deployments using `vercel logs <deployment-url>`

Action: Update the CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) to specify pnpm version in the "Setup pnpm" step, or add packageManager field to package.json to specify the pnpm version.

5. Ensuring the production site returns HTTP 200 instead of HTTP 401 by resolving authentication/access issues

2. Reviewing the build command `npm run deploy:check` that runs `npm run verify && npm run screenshots` to identify which step is failing## NOW

1. **Fix Deploy workflow screenshot test failures** - The Deploy workflow is failing at the "Run screenshot tests" step (exit code 1), which is also contributing to the deployment protection not working as intended.

## NEXT

2. **Investigate and fix Vercel deployment protection mechanism** - Despite having the correct configuration in vercel.json with requiredStatusChecks, failed GitHub Actions are not preventing Vercel deployments. Need to verify the integration between GitHub status checks and Vercel deployment protection.

3. Testing the build pipeline locally to reproduce the deployment issue

3. **Implement deployment rollback capability** - Add automated or manual rollback mechanism for failed deployments, potentially through a GitHub Actions workflow that can revert to the last successful deployment.

1. **Implement rollback capability for deployments**: Add rollback scripts to package.json that can quickly revert to the last known good deployment using Vercel CLI commands, and document the rollback procedure for emergency use.

## LATER

4. Fixing any issues found in the build process, dependencies, or configuration

1. **Complete remaining story implementations** - Once deployment protection is working correctly, continue implementing the remaining stories from the release 0.5 backlog in priority order.

2. **Verify preview deployment functionality**: Create a test pull request to ensure preview deployments work correctly and remain unaffected by the production deployment protection rules.

2. **Enhance monitoring and alerting** - Add comprehensive monitoring for deployment status and automated alerts for deployment failures to improve visibility into production issues.

5. Ensuring the production site returns HTTP 200 instead of HTTP 401 by resolving authentication/access issues

3. **Optimize deployment pipeline performance** - Review and optimize the CI/CD pipeline for faster feedback loops while maintaining quality gates.
3. **Test and optimize deployment timing**: Once deployments are working, measure the actual time from CI completion to deployment start to ensure it meets the 30-second requirement for fast feedback.

**Fix Secret Scanning License Issue**## NOW

4. **Complete GitHub Actions workflow integration**: Ensure all required status checks ("CI & Playwright multi-browser tests", "Deploy to Production", "Security Audit") are properly integrated and reporting status correctly to Vercel.

1. **Enhance emergency override workflow**: Improve the emergency deployment override process with better logging, notification systems, and approval workflows for critical production fixes.

1. **Implement rollback capability for deployments**: Add rollback scripts to package.json that can quickly revert to the last known good deployment using Vercel CLI commands, and document the rollback procedure for emergency use.

2. **Add deployment monitoring and alerting**: Implement automated monitoring of deployment success/failure rates and set up alerts for deployment protection failures to catch issues early.

Set the GITLEAKS_LICENSE as a GitHub repository secret to resolve the blocking issue in story 021.2-DEV-CI-SECURITY. The license value is already available in the .env file (FECF82-F4B739-AE735F-9D4EF7-014BA6-V3) and needs to be added as a GitHub Secret named GITLEAKS_LICENSE so the secret scanning workflow can authenticate properly.

3. **Optimize build performance**: Review and optimize the build process to reduce deployment times while maintaining quality gates.

2. **Verify preview deployment functionality**: Create a test pull request to ensure preview deployments work correctly and remain unaffected by the production deployment protection rules.

4. **Documentation and runbooks**: Create comprehensive documentation for the deployment protection system, including troubleshooting guides and emergency procedures for the development team.

**Production Readiness and Optimization**## NEXTInvestigate and resolve the recent deployment failures that are occurring despite having deployment protection configured. Based on the assessment findings, there are deployment errors happening in production (latest error 9 minutes ago, previous error 13 hours ago) while the deployment protection configuration appears correct.The critical blocker is the systematic failure of the `.github/workflows/e2e-stability.yml` workflow. All recent runs fail immediately with "workflow file issue" errors and 0s duration. This must be resolved to complete story 021.4-DEV-CI-STABILITY.
