# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 19, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (85% Complete)  
**Current Status**: Strong foundation complete - ready to finish remaining 15%

## NOW

**ðŸŽ¯ Complete Production Verification System (Story 014.1-DEV-PROD-VERIFICATION)**

**Why This First**: Production verification is critical for deployment confidence and is the highest impact missing piece. Without it, we can't confidently validate that https://voder.ai is working correctly vs. showing hosting provider holding pages.

**Current Assessment**: Project is 85% complete with excellent infrastructure. All core functionality works, zero security vulnerabilities, all quality gates passing. The missing 15% is primarily operational tooling, not user-facing features.

**Detailed Implementation Plan**:

1. **Enhance Production E2E Tests** (90 minutes):
   - Modify existing `tests/e2e/screenshots.spec.ts` to properly validate production content
   - Add content verification tests that fail on Namecheap holding pages
   - Implement proper error detection for production deployment failures
   - Add performance validation (page load times, resource loading)
   - Ensure `npm run e2e:ci:prod` provides comprehensive production health checks

2. **Create Health Check Infrastructure** (60 minutes):
   - Implement robust health checking in existing `scripts/health-check.js`
   - Add HTTP status verification, response time monitoring, and content validation
   - Create clear reporting that indicates production site health status
   - Add integration points for CI/CD pipeline verification

3. **Validate and Test** (30 minutes):
   - Test health checks against both working and failing scenarios
   - Verify production verification catches holding pages and errors
   - Ensure clear pass/fail reporting for deployment validation

**Success Criteria**: 
- `npm run e2e:ci:prod` reliably detects if https://voder.ai is working vs. showing holding pages
- Health check scripts provide clear production site status
- All tests pass and production verification is ready for CI/CD integration
- Health checks detect issues and report status
- Verification integrated into deployment workflow
- All existing tests continue to pass
   ```javascript
   // Add to each test in tests/e2e/screenshots.spec.ts:
   const consoleErrors: string[] = [];
   page.on('console', msg => {
     if (msg.type() === 'error') {
       consoleErrors.push(msg.text());

## NEXT

**Complete Decision Management Process Documentation (Story 001.1-PO-DECISION-MANAGEMENT)**

**Why Second Priority**: Process documentation is important for team workflow but doesn't block production deployment. Can be done in parallel with ongoing development.

**Implementation Plan** (2 hours):

1. **Document Standards Cultivation Process** (60 minutes):
   - Create process documentation for open proposal system
   - Define production track record validation approach
   - Document exemption encouragement and tracking as experiments
   - Establish regular review and deprecation cycles

2. **Create Process Documentation** (45 minutes):
   - Document exemption tracking procedures
   - Create standards review cycle guidelines
   - Establish cleanup documentation to prevent future duplicates
   - Define status tracking process for decision updates

3. **Validate ADR System** (15 minutes):
   - Test complete ADR workflow from proposal to acceptance
   - Verify all 29 existing ADRs follow proper format
   - Ensure decision management system is fully operational

**Enhanced E2E Testing Coverage** (1 hour):

4. **Strengthen Test Coverage**:
   - Add comprehensive console error detection validation
   - Implement error handling scenario testing
   - Add performance monitoring during tests
   - Expand cross-browser testing to Firefox/Safari (if needed)
