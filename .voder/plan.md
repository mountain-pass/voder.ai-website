# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 18, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (87.0/100) - Critical blockers identified  
**Current Status**: Release 0.5 complete with blocking issues preventing new story development

---

## NOW

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Resolve Blocking Issues Before New Story Development**

**Assessment Findings**: The project has achieved excellent quality (87.0/100) with all 19 stories functionally complete, but critical blocking issues prevent new story development.

**Critical Blocking Issues Requiring Immediate Action**:

1. **Restore Clean Git State** (Critical - Blocks all development)
   - **Issue**: 4 commits ahead of origin/main + 1 uncommitted file
   - **Action**: Commit current assessment update and push all changes to origin
   - **Commands**: `git add .voder/implementation-progress.md && git commit -m "Complete comprehensive project assessment" && git push origin main`
   - **Validation**: `git status` shows clean working tree and up-to-date with origin

2. **Address Security Vulnerabilities** (Critical - 10 vulnerabilities found)
   - **Issue**: 10 security vulnerabilities (6 moderate, 4 high severity) in development dependencies
   - **Affected**: esbuild â‰¤0.24.2, path-to-regexp 4.0.0-6.2.2, undici â‰¤5.28.5
   - **Impact**: Supply chain threats affecting build pipeline and CI/CD security
   - **Action**: Run `npm audit fix --force` (requires breaking change to vercel@25.2.0)
   - **Validation**: `npm audit` shows 0 vulnerabilities
   - **Risk**: Breaking change may require deployment configuration updates

3. **Verify Quality Gates After Security Fixes**
   - **Action**: Run complete verification pipeline after security updates
   - **Commands**: `npm run verify` (audit â†’ lint â†’ format â†’ build â†’ test)
   - **Expected**: All quality gates continue passing with updated dependencies
   - **Fix**: Address any breaking changes from Vercel CLI upgrade

**Priority**: Critical - Must complete before any new development work  
**Effort**: 1-2 hours  
**Impact**: Removes all blockers for new story development and ensures secure development environment
