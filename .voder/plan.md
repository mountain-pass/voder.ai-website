# Implementation Plan

## NOW

Implement Story 026.01-BIZ-SCROLL-DETECTION: Create ScrollNarrativeDetector class to track scroll progress through the narrative section.

**Implementation Steps**:

1. Create new file `src/scroll-narrative-detector.ts` with ScrollNarrativeDetector class
2. Implement IntersectionObserver to detect when narrative section enters/exits viewport
3. Implement scroll handler using requestAnimationFrame for smooth updates
4. Calculate scroll progress as percentage (0-100%) based on section visibility
5. Add console debug logging for scroll progress tracking
6. Export the class from the module
7. Initialize ScrollNarrativeDetector in `src/main.ts` after DOM is ready
8. Create comprehensive unit tests in `tests/scroll-narrative-detector.test.ts`
9. Create E2E tests in `tests/e2e/scroll-narrative-detector.spec.ts` to validate scroll detection behavior

**Selector**: Target `.panel` element (the narrative section container)

**Success Criteria**:
- Console logs show accurate scroll progress percentages (0-100%)
- IntersectionObserver efficiently detects viewport entry/exit
- Scroll events throttled with requestAnimationFrame
- Works consistently across all device sizes
- No performance degradation during scrolling
- All tests passing

## NEXT

None - This completes the current incomplete story. After implementation, the assessment process will validate completion and check remaining stories.

## LATER

None - Wait for next assessment cycle to determine what work is needed after 026.01 is complete.
