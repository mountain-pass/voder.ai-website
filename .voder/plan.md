# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 17, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (90.2/100)  
**Current Status**: Excellent foundation with blocking issues preventing new story development

---

## NOW

**Commit untracked story files to restore clean git state**

The project currently has 2 untracked story files that must be committed before any new story development can begin:
- `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/012.0-DEV-TEST-COVERAGE.md`
- `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/012.1-DEV-GIT-HOOKS.md`

**Action**: 
```bash
git add prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/012.0-DEV-TEST-COVERAGE.md prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/012.1-DEV-GIT-HOOKS.md
git commit -m "Add stories 012.0-DEV-TEST-COVERAGE and 012.1-DEV-GIT-HOOKS

- 012.0: Test coverage reporting requirements (already implemented)
- 012.1: Git hooks for quality gates (pending implementation)"
git push origin main
```

**Priority**: Critical - Required for clean git state before new story development  
**Effort**: 2 minutes  
**Impact**: Removes primary blocking issue for new story development

---

## NEXT

**Complete story 012.1-DEV-GIT-HOOKS implementation**

The git hooks story requirements are defined but not yet implemented. This story requires:

1. **Install git hooks framework**
   - Choose between simple-git-hooks or husky
   - Configure hooks through package.json
   - Ensure automatic installation during npm install

2. **Implement pre-commit quality validation**
   - Run ESLint in check-only mode (no --fix)
   - Run Prettier in check-only mode (--check, not --write)
   - Run TypeScript type checking
   - Run test suite
   - Provide clear error messages on failure

3. **Configure selective file checking**
   - Only validate files being committed (staged files)
   - Optimize for performance on large repositories

4. **Document hook behavior**
   - Explain what hooks do and when they run
   - Provide guidance for resolving common issues
   - Document bypass options for emergency commits

**Priority**: High - Required to complete all in-scope stories  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Impact**: Completes final development infrastructure story, ensures quality gates

**Secondary tasks**:
- **Fix markdown linting configuration**: Exclude or configure rules for generated docs/libraries/ files
- **Dependency updates**: Apply minor version updates for @types/node, @typescript-eslint/*, eslint, htmlhint
- **Documentation review**: Ensure all setup instructions remain current

**Priority**: Medium - Quality improvements and maintenance  
**Effort**: 1-2 hours  
**Impact**: Maintains project hygiene and resolves remaining quality issues

## LATER

**Implement business content and user-facing features**

1. **Website content development**
   - Replace minimal landing page with business content
   - Implement sections identified in user story mapping
   - Add visual design elements and branding
   - Integrate analytics and user engagement features

2. **Advanced development process enhancements**
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline with quality gates
   - Add performance monitoring and Lighthouse scoring
   - Explore pre-commit hook optimizations
   - Consider deployment pipeline improvements

3. **Architecture and scalability preparation**
   - Evaluate need for content management capabilities
   - Plan for additional frameworks or libraries
   - Consider performance optimization strategies
   - Prepare for production deployment requirements

4. **Story backlog implementation**
   - Implement future stories as they are defined in release planning
   - Currently 14 stories exist, more will be added based on business needs
   - Maintain excellent quality standards (90.2/100 foundation score)
   - Continue using systematic story management and ADR processes

**Priority**: Low - Future development after foundation completion  
**Effort**: Varies by feature scope and business requirements  
**Impact**: Delivers business value and user-facing functionality

## Assessment Summary

**Current State**: The project has an excellent development foundation (90.2/100) with:
- **Perfect scores** in code quality, testing, execution, and security
- **12 of 14 stories** completely implemented and functional
- **Modern tooling stack** working perfectly (TypeScript, ESLint v9, Vitest, Vite)
- **100% test coverage** with zero security vulnerabilities

**Blocking Issues**: 
- Untracked files preventing clean git state
- Incomplete git hooks implementation (story 012.1)

**Ready for**: Foundation completion, then business feature development with confidence in quality standards.
