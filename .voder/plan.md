# Implementation Plan

Based on the visual assessment results and the mobile typography issue identified, I need to address the tagline sizing on mobile devices to improve brand message hierarchy.

## NOW

**Fix Mobile Typography Hierarchy Issue**: Update the tagline "AI Coding Without the Slop" to have better visual prominence on mobile devices relative to the "VODER" brand name.

1. **Identify Current Mobile Typography Settings**
   - Locate the CSS file controlling hero section typography
   - Find current font-size values for mobile breakpoints
   - Identify the tagline selector and responsive rules

2. **Update Mobile Tagline Font Size**
   - Increase tagline font size on mobile from current ~14-16px to ~18-20px
   - Ensure proper line-height and spacing adjustments
   - Maintain visual balance without breaking layout
   - Test across mobile viewports (375px, 414px, etc.)

3. **Validate Typography Changes**
   - Generate new screenshots to verify improved hierarchy
   - Ensure readability and visual impact are enhanced
   - Check that layout remains responsive and functional

## NEXT

**Complete Typography Fix Validation and Address Brand Colors**

1. **Run Full Test Suite**
   - Execute all tests to ensure no regressions from typography changes
   - Update visual assessment documentation with typography fix
   - Generate updated screenshots showing improved mobile hierarchy

2. **Address Brand Color Consistency** (if still needed)
   - Update 3D cube volumetric caustics color from `0x5599ee` to `0x24d1d5`
   - Ensure color consistency with "Join the Waitlist" button
   - Test visual quality impact of color changes

## LATER
