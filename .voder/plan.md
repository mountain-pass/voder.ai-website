# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 18, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (96.6/100)  
**Current Status**: Outstanding foundation complete - 15/16 stories implemented

---

## NOW

**Track and commit the untracked story file to restore clean git state**

The project has achieved outstanding scores (96.6/100) with all 15 development infrastructure stories complete and functional. However, there is an untracked story file that prevents starting new development work.

**Immediate Action**:
```bash
# Track the untracked story file
git add prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/013.0-BIZ-BRAND-ENTRY.md

# Commit with clear message about story addition
git commit -m "Add 013.0-BIZ-BRAND-ENTRY story to project scope

- Adds business content story for minimal brand identity landing
- Completes story portfolio expansion (16 total stories)
- Enables clean git state for continued development
- Development infrastructure remains complete (15/15)"

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

**Verification**:
- Confirm `git status` shows clean working directory with no untracked files
- Verify all quality gates still pass: `npm run verify`
- Validate story file is properly tracked and committed

**Priority**: Critical - Required to enable new story development  
**Effort**: 2-3 minutes  
**Impact**: Removes blocking issue, enables progression to business content implementation

## NEXT

**Implement the brand identity landing story and optimize development infrastructure**

With clean git state restored, focus on implementing the business content story and resolving remaining infrastructure optimizations.

**Priority Actions**:
1. **Implement 013.0-BIZ-BRAND-ENTRY story**:
   - Add Voder logo display prominently at top of page
   - Implement clean, professional typography and layout
   - Ensure responsive design across desktop, tablet, and mobile
   - Meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
   - Optimize performance with minimal assets
   - Apply Voder brand colors (Black #0A0A0A, Soft Teal Glow #24D1D5)
   - Use Inter/Satoshi fonts for headlines

2. **Infrastructure optimizations**:
   - Exclude docs/libraries/ from markdown linting (resolve 662 third-party formatting errors)
   - Apply available minor dependency updates (@types/node, @typescript-eslint/*, eslint)
   - Add explicit git hooks documentation to README.md
   - Verify all quality gates continue working perfectly

**Priority**: High - Complete story portfolio and optimize foundation  
**Effort**: 4-6 hours  
**Impact**: Achieves 100% story completion, resolves all remaining minor issues
