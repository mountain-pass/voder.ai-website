## NOW

Stage and commit all current changes (including `.gitignore`, `.voder/history.md`, `.voder/plan.md`, `README.md`, `playwright.config.js`, and `prompts/development-guidelines.md`) with a descriptive message such as “Update plan references and configuration adjustments”.

## NEXT

- Push the new commit to `origin/main`.  
- Run the full CI test suite locally via `npm run test:ci` to verify all Playwright tests still pass.  
- If any tests fail, fix the underlying code or tests in the affected files and commit those fixes.

## LATER

- Review and refine the `.gitignore` entries to ensure no necessary files are being excluded.  
- Plan and implement any outstanding UI or content updates to the Reveal.js deck in `src/index.html` and `src/main.css`.  
- Prepare for production deployment by verifying performance, accessibility (color contrast), and SEO optimizations.
