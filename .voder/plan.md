**Status**: STORY 026.02 COMPLETE  
**Assessment**: Story 026.02-BIZ-SCROLL-LOCKED-REVEAL implemented successfully

## NOW

**Story 026.02 Complete - Ready for Next Assessment**

Story 026.02-BIZ-SCROLL-LOCKED-REVEAL (formerly BIZ-VIEWPORT-FIXED-OVERLAY) has been successfully implemented with position:sticky approach after user correction.

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ ScrollLockedReveal class implemented (150 lines)
- ✅ Scroll-stage + sticky-panel architecture
- ✅ Progressive reveal with smoothstep easing
- ✅ 20 unit tests + 10 E2E tests (all passing)
- ✅ All 277 tests passing (excellent test coverage)
- ✅ All code quality gates passing (linting, formatting, type checking)
- ✅ Story document rewritten to describe WHAT not HOW
- ✅ Committed to git (commit 8a01b3b)

**Next Action**: Re-run traceability assessment to validate all remaining stories and determine overall project readiness.

### Implementation Steps

### Implementation Summary

Story 026.02 was initially implemented with position:fixed approach but user testing revealed critical issues (content "jiggling" and blocking scrolling). After user provided working HTML demo showing position:sticky pattern, the implementation was completely redesigned.

**Final Implementation** (position:sticky approach):
1. ✅ ScrollLockedReveal class (`src/scroll-locked-reveal.ts`) - 150 lines
   - Scroll-stage container creates scroll distance
   - Sticky-panel uses CSS position:sticky (no JS position switching)
   - Progressive reveal with smoothstep easing
   - ResizeObserver for responsive updates

2. ✅ CSS styling (`src/style.css`)
   - `.scroll-stage` with dynamic height calculation
   - `.sticky-panel` with position: sticky; top: 0
   - `[data-reveal-start]` for progressive element reveal
   - `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` support

3. ✅ HTML structure (`index.html`)
   - Wrapped narrative in `.scroll-stage` container
   - Added `.sticky-panel` wrapper
   - Data attributes for reveal timing

4. ✅ Integration (`src/main.ts`)
   - Import and instantiate ScrollLockedReveal
   - No scrollDetector dependency needed

5. ✅ Tests
   - 20 unit tests (`tests/scroll-locked-reveal.test.ts`)
   - 10 E2E tests (`tests/e2e/scroll-locked-reveal.spec.ts`)
   - All 277 tests passing

6. ✅ Story documentation updated
   - Title changed to "Scroll-Locked Narrative Reveal"
   - Requirements focus on WHAT (outcome) not HOW (implementation)
   - Implementation notes provide guidance without prescribing approach

## NEXT

**Re-run Complete Assessment**

After story 026.02 is complete:

1. **Re-run Traceability Validation**
   - Validate remaining 50 traceability files (fail-fast approach)
   - Identify any other incomplete stories
   - Generate updated implementation-progress.md

2. **Verify Quality Gates**
   - Ensure all 257+ tests still passing
   - Verify linting, formatting, type checking clean
   - Confirm no new problems introduced

3. **Assessment Decision Point**
   - If all stories PASS: ✅ **READY FOR NEW STORY DEVELOPMENT**
   - If any story FAILS: ⚠️ **BLOCKED BY STORIES** (repeat completion cycle)

## LATER

**Future work (after story 026.02 complete and all stories validated)**

### 1. Continue Narrative Enhancement
If all traceability validation passes:
- Pull next story from backlog (likely related to cinematic effects)
- Implement scroll-driven animation effects
- Add dynamic content reveals based on scroll position
- Enhance user engagement tracking

### 2. Optional Dependency Updates (when packages mature)
After story work is unblocked, consider optional updates:
- **Oct 25**: jsdom@27.0.1 (currently 5 days old)
- **Oct 27**: @typescript-eslint packages (currently 3 days old)
- **Oct 28**: @axe-core/playwright, @types/node, happy-dom (currently 2 days old)
- **Oct 29**: Netlify-cli security update per SECURITY-INCIDENT-2025-10-23
- **Oct 30**: vite, vitest (major version - requires review)

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Monitor viewport-fixed positioning performance
- Track scroll event handling efficiency
- Optimize requestAnimationFrame usage if needed
- Document any performance characteristics

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Document ViewportFixedOverlay architecture
- Update library usage guides if needed
- Record lessons learned from cinematic implementation

## Notes

**Story Completion Priority**: Story 026.02 must be completed before any new story development per assessment policy. Dependency updates are optional and can wait.

**Technical Foundation**: Excellent foundation already in place:
- ✅ ScrollNarrativeDetector working perfectly (dependency satisfied)
- ✅ All 257 tests passing (strong quality foundation)
- ✅ All code quality gates passing (professional standards)
- ✅ Zero unresolved problems (clean issue tracker)

**Assessment Framework**: Using fail-fast traceability validation to efficiently identify incomplete stories. Only 1 file checked before finding 026.02 incomplete (efficient process).

**Gall's Law Compliance**: Building sophisticated cinematic storytelling incrementally. Story 026.01 (scroll detection) working; now adding 026.02 (viewport-fixed overlay) as next layer.

**Next Full Assessment**: After story 026.02 complete, re-run traceability validation to check remaining 50 stories.
