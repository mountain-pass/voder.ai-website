## ðŸ“‹ STRATEGIC DECISION POINT

### Option A: Deploy Current Prototype (1 week)
**Timeline:** 1 week  
**Effort:** Minimal polish and deployment  
**Result:** Functional landing page with excellent accessibility  
**Trade-off:** No cinematic experience, basic visual presentation  

### Option B: Achieve Full Specification Compliance (12-16 weeks)
**Timeline:** 3-4 months  
**Effort:** Substantial development across all visual systems  
**Result:** Premium cinematic brand experience as originally specified  
**Trade-off:** Significant time and resource investment  

### Option C: Hybrid Approach - Core Cinematic Features (8-10 weeks)
**Timeline:** 2-2.5 months  
**Effort:** Focus on highest-impact visual features  
**Result:** Compelling cinematic experience hitting 70% of specifications  
**Trade-off:** Some advanced interactions deferred
