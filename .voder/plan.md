# Implementation Plan

## NOW

**Resolve P003: Coming Soon Button Overlapping 3D Cube (Priority 7 - High)**

Follow ITIL problem management process:

1. **Complete Root Cause Analysis** for P003
   - Problem is already identified: CSS negative margin (`margin: 0 0 -100vh`) in `.hero-animation` pulls content up over the 3D canvas
   - The `hero-animation` div (3D canvas container) is positioned before the text content in HTML, but uses negative margin to overlay text on top
   - Layout creates visual overlap where "Coming Soon" button appears directly over 3D cube

2. **Create Failing Test** 
   - Write Playwright E2E test that verifies button and 3D cube don't overlap
   - Test should check z-index stacking and visual positioning
   - Confirm test fails with current layout (reproduces the problem)

3. **Implement Targeted Workaround**
   - Based on root cause: Adjust CSS layout to prevent overlap
   - Simple solution: Modify `.hero-animation` positioning to create proper separation
   - Remove negative margin and adjust layout to position 3D cube as true background
   - Ensure text content has proper vertical spacing above the 3D canvas

4. **Transition to Known Error Status**
   - Move P003 from `.open.md` to `.known-error.md`
   - Document workaround implementation
   - Create INVEST-compliant story for permanent design solution

## NEXT

**Clean Up Problem Management System**

1. **Resolve Duplicate Problem Files**
   - Remove duplicate `.open.md` files for problems already in `.known-error.md` status
   - Keep only the `.known-error.md` versions for:
     - `mobile-3d-cube-size-jump-scroll.known-error.md` (delete .open.md)
     - `text-flash-before-3d-render.known-error.md` (delete .open.md)
   - Ensures single source of truth for problem status

2. **Implement P003 Permanent Fix** 
   - Create proper design system for hero section layout
   - Implement clean CSS Grid or Flexbox solution that naturally separates content
   - Replace hacky negative margin approach with intentional layout design
   - Re-enable and verify P003 test passes

3. **Complete Project Quality Gates**
   - Ensure all tests pass with layout fixes
   - Verify code coverage remains >80%
   - Confirm no new linting or formatting issues
   - Validate responsive design across all device sizes

## LATER

**Future Enhancements and Monitoring**

1. **Design System Foundation**
   - Establish consistent spacing and layout patterns
   - Create reusable CSS components for hero sections
   - Document layout best practices to prevent similar issues

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor 3D animation performance metrics
   - Optimize Three.js initialization for faster load times
   - Consider progressive enhancement strategies

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - A/B test different button positions and styles
   - Analyze user engagement with coming soon CTA
   - Gather feedback on 3D animation effectiveness

4. **Preventive Measures**
   - Add automated visual regression testing
   - Implement design system governance
   - Create layout validation rules in CI/CD pipeline
