### üéØ HIGH PRIORITY: Live Prompt Interaction System

**Real-Time UI Transformation Engine**

Build the sophisticated prompt editing interface specified:

- Create terminal-style prompt editing interface with live typing
- Implement real-time UI transformation system beyond simple text swap
- Build multiple interactive prompt examples:
  - Casual design ‚Üí Premium transformation with live morphing
  - Dark mode toggle with instant UI state changes
  - Logo and color palette morphing with smooth transitions
  - Button style and layout changes in real-time
- Add warm, focused lighting effects on active UI elements
- Implement background darkening for focus isolation
- Create hover reveals for additional prompt examples
- Build keyboard navigation and accessibility support

- Re-enabled and enhanced `VisualChaos.ts` for Problem Space section
- Code fragment particle system with proper file types (.tsx, webpack.config.js, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- Floating and collision behaviors for development artifacts
- Color-coded fragments by file type (TypeScript blue, JSON gold, CSS blue, JS yellow)
- Parallax movement responding to mouse movement
- Grain overlay for atmospheric friction feeling
- Proper reduced motion support (skips 3D when prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)
- Boundary management to keep fragments visible
- Enhanced chaos intensity controls for scroll interactions
- Full test coverage and accessibility compliance

## üöß IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Architecture Patterns for Each Phase

```typescript
class TransitionController {
  trigger: ScrollTrigger | TimeBasedTrigger | InteractionTrigger;
  duration: number; // in milliseconds, specified in prompts
  phases: AnimationPhase[];
  accessibilityHandler: A11yHandler;
  testSelectors: TestSelector[];
  reducedMotionFallback: StaticState;
}
```

### Development Principles

1. **Maintain Test Coverage:** All 57 tests must continue passing throughout development
2. **Accessibility First:** Every visual enhancement must respect WCAG 2.1 AA requirements  
3. **Progressive Enhancement:** Build graceful fallbacks for all advanced features
4. **Performance Budgets:** No feature ships if it degrades core performance metrics
5. **Device Detection:** Sophisticated capability detection for appropriate feature delivery
6. **Specification Compliance:** Every feature must match the detailed prompts documentation

### Technical Implementation Strategy

- **Animation Framework:** Build on existing GSAP/ScrollTrigger infrastructure
- **3D Systems:** Extend established Three.js foundation from BrandEntry3D.ts and VisualChaos.ts
- **State Management:** Maintain stateless functional component architecture  
- **Testing Strategy:** Add visual regression tests for each animation state
