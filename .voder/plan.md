**Fix deployment errors blocking story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION****Fix E2E Stability Monitoring Workflow**



Investigate and resolve the recent deployment failures that are occurring despite having deployment protection configured. Based on the assessment findings, there are deployment errors happening in production (latest error 9 minutes ago, previous error 13 hours ago) while the deployment protection configuration appears correct.The critical blocker is the systematic failure of the `.github/workflows/e2e-stability.yml` workflow. All recent runs fail immediately with "workflow file issue" errors and 0s duration. This must be resolved to complete story 021.4-DEV-CI-STABILITY.



Specific actions:**Specific actions:**

1. Access Vercel dashboard to examine detailed error logs for the failed deployments1. Debug the workflow syntax and configuration issues causing immediate failures

2. Check if deployment errors are caused by build failures, runtime issues, or Vercel platform problems2. Test the workflow execution locally and via manual trigger to identify root cause

3. Review the deployment protection implementation to ensure it's actually blocking deployments when GitHub Actions fail3. Fix any YAML syntax errors, permission issues, or step configuration problems

4. Test the deployment protection by intentionally failing a CI check and verifying deployment is blocked4. Ensure the workflow can successfully run E2E tests against production environment (not just preview)

5. Verify that the emergency override workflow functions correctly for critical fixes5. Verify the stability data collection and reporting mechanisms work correctly

6. Fix any identified issues in the deployment configuration or underlying code causing failures6. Test that both scheduled (nightly) and manual triggers execute successfully

7. Confirm that historical data preservation is functioning for trend analysis

**Success criteria:** The e2e-stability workflow runs successfully without immediate failure, collects meaningful stability metrics, and generates proper reports with trend data.

**Complete deployment monitoring and rollback capabilities**

## NEXT

After resolving the immediate deployment errors, ensure the full deployment protection story is operationally complete:

**Complete Remaining Implementation Work**

1. Test and verify rollback mechanisms work correctly for failed deployments

2. Validate deployment status monitoring accurately reports actual deployment state vs CI state  After fixing the E2E stability workflow:

3. Ensure deployment timing meets the 30-second fast feedback requirement

4. Test deployment verification using Vercel CLI commands (`vercel ls`, `vercel inspect`) 1. Implement production environment testing in the stability workflow (currently only tests preview server)

5. Verify deployment protection works seamlessly with trunk-based development workflow2. Add historical data preservation mechanism for long-term trend analysis

6. Update any deployment scripts or monitoring configurations as needed3. Implement early warning alert system for stability degradation detection

4. Complete any missing functionality identified during the workflow debugging process

**Optimize deployment reliability and monitoring**

**Project Completion and Maintenance Setup**

Future improvements to enhance the deployment system beyond basic story completion:

1. Document the completed E2E stability monitoring system

1. Implement enhanced deployment metrics and dashboards2. Establish ongoing monitoring and maintenance procedures for all completed systems

2. Add automated deployment health checks and synthetic monitoring3. Clean up temporary development artifacts and documentation

3. Improve deployment error notification and alerting systems4. Prepare project for new development cycles with robust stability foundations
4. Consider implementing blue-green or canary deployment strategies
5. Add deployment performance optimization and caching improvements
6. Enhance integration with additional monitoring tools and services
