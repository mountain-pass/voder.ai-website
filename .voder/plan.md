**Transform basic cube into simple floating code fragments**



Replace the current rotating cube with a minimal implementation of floating code fragments:## NOWFollowing Gall's Law: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked."## NOW



1. **Create CodeFragment class** - Simple text sprites that float in 3D space

   - Use Three.js TextGeometry or HTML-based text overlays

   - Start with 3-5 hardcoded code snippets: `function createUser()`, `class User`, `const data = {}`**Transform basic cube into simple floating code fragments**

   - Basic floating motion with gentle drift and rotation

   - Simple mouse attraction - fragments move slightly toward cursor



2. **Add basic code-to-cube transformation** - Simplest possible morphingReplace the current rotating cube with a minimal implementation of floating code fragments:## NOW**Fix Code Coverage Thresholds to Meet Quality Gates**

   - Code fragments converge into current cube position when animation starts

   - Cube appears after fragments cluster together (3-4 second sequence)

   - Use simple position interpolation, no complex particle systems yet

1. **Create CodeFragment class** - Simple text sprites that float in 3D space

3. **Maintain existing functionality** 

   - Keep WebGL detection and 2D fallback   - Use Three.js TextGeometry or HTML-based text overlays

   - Preserve mouse/scroll interactions on final cube form

   - Keep accessibility features (reduced motion)   - Start with 3-5 hardcoded code snippets: `function createUser()`, `class User`, `const data = {}`**Fix FOUC prevention by adding static HTML content to index.html**The critical blocker is failing test coverage thresholds. Current coverage (79.54% lines, 82.6% functions, 79.54% statements) falls short of required thresholds (89% lines, 90% functions, 89% statements). 



**Success criteria**: Visitors see recognizable code snippets floating, then watch them organize into the familiar cube. Core emotional connection established through authentic code visibility.   - Basic floating motion with gentle drift and rotation



## NEXT   - Simple mouse attraction - fragments move slightly toward cursor



**Enhance code fragments with visual appeal**



1. **Add syntax highlighting** - Color code fragments to look like real code2. **Add basic code-to-cube transformation** - Simplest possible morphingThe simplest possible implementation: Pre-render the core content directly in the HTML template so it appears immediately without JavaScript. This addresses the critical blocking issue where the page shows blank content when JavaScript is disabled.**Primary Issue**: `three-animation.ts` has only 26.31% line coverage, significantly dragging down overall project coverage.

   - Use CSS classes or Three.js materials for syntax colors

   - JavaScript orange keywords, blue strings, green comments   - Code fragments converge into current cube position when animation starts

   - Make fragments feel more authentic and recognizable

   - Cube appears after fragments cluster together (3-4 second sequence)

2. **Improve transformation sequence** - Make morphing more elegant

   - Add gentle particle trails as fragments move   - Use simple position interpolation, no complex particle systems yet

   - Smooth scale transitions during convergence

   - Brief pause/cluster moment before final cube formation**Specific actions:****Immediate Action**:

   - CSS selectors: `.hero-animation`, `@media`

   - Import statements: `import { useState }`   - Preserve mouse/scroll interactions on final cube form



4. **Mobile touch interactions** - Basic touch response   - Keep accessibility features (reduced motion)2. Add the header with VODER branding2. Add comprehensive unit tests for the ThreeAnimation class to cover:

   - Touch creates gentle ripple effect

   - Fragments cluster toward touch point briefly

   - Maintain smooth performance on mobile devices
