# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 17, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (97.8/100)  
**Current Status**: Outstanding foundation with one incomplete story and minor cleanup needed

---

## NOW

**Commit current changes and implement git hooks to complete development infrastructure**

The project has achieved excellent scores (97.8/100) with 14 of 15 stories complete. Need to finalize git state and complete the last infrastructure story.

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Commit current assessment updates**:
   ```bash
   git add .voder/implementation-progress.md .gitignore prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/012.2-DEV-PREPARE-SCRIPT.md
   git commit -m "Update assessment and add library documentation story
   
   - Updated implementation progress (97.8/100 score)
   - Added 012.2-DEV-PREPARE-SCRIPT story (already implemented)
   - Added docs/libraries/ to .gitignore per requirements"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Implement story 012.1-DEV-GIT-HOOKS** (the only incomplete story):
   - Install simple-git-hooks or husky framework
   - Configure pre-commit quality validation (lint:check, format:check, type-check, test)
   - Add hooks configuration to package.json
   - Test hooks work correctly with staged files
   - Document hook behavior and bypass options

**Priority**: Critical - Required to achieve 100% story completion  
**Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Impact**: Completes development infrastructure foundation, enables confident feature development

## NEXT

**Quality maintenance and dependency updates**

With development infrastructure complete, focus on maintaining excellent quality standards and keeping dependencies current.

**Actions**:
1. **Dependency updates**: Apply available minor version updates for @types/node, @typescript-eslint/*, eslint, htmlhint
2. **Documentation review**: Ensure all setup instructions remain current with git hooks
3. **Quality validation**: Verify all quality gates continue working perfectly
4. **Performance optimization**: Monitor build and test performance as project grows

**Priority**: Medium - Quality improvements and maintenance  
**Effort**: 1-2 hours  
**Impact**: Maintains project hygiene and resolves remaining minor issues

## LATER

**Business content development and user-facing features**

With outstanding development foundation (97.8/100) complete, begin implementing business value and user experience.

**High-level initiatives**:

1. **Website content and design**
   - Replace minimal landing page with compelling business content
   - Implement visual design system and branding elements
   - Add user engagement features and analytics integration
   - Create responsive design for multiple device types

2. **Advanced development capabilities**
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline with automated quality gates
   - Add performance monitoring and Lighthouse scoring
   - Explore advanced build optimizations and caching strategies
   - Consider content management and dynamic content capabilities

3. **Production readiness**
   - Deploy pipeline to production hosting
   - Configure monitoring, logging, and error tracking
   - Implement security headers and performance optimizations
   - Plan for scalability and traffic growth

4. **Future story development**
   - Implement additional stories as defined in release planning
   - Maintain excellent quality standards (97.8/100+ foundation)
   - Continue using systematic story management and ADR processes
   - Expand development team capabilities as needed

**Priority**: Low - Future development after foundation completion  
**Effort**: Varies by feature scope and business requirements  
**Impact**: Delivers business value and user-facing functionality

## Assessment Summary

**Current State**: The project has an outstanding development foundation (97.8/100) with:
- **Perfect scores** in code quality, testing, execution, and security (100/100 each)
- **14 of 15 stories** completely implemented and functional
- **Modern tooling stack** working perfectly (TypeScript, ESLint v9, Vitest, Vite 7.1+)
- **100% test coverage** with zero security vulnerabilities
- **Excellent library documentation system** with 36 dependency READMEs automatically symlinked

**Minor Gap**: 
- Git hooks implementation (story 012.1) - the only incomplete infrastructure story

**Ready for**: Foundation completion, then confident business feature development with excellent quality standards.
