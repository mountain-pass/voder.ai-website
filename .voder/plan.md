## NOW

Commit the newly created Svelte narrative components (ProblemSection, GpsVsDirectionsSection, HowItWorksSection, PromptIterationSection, OutcomeSection, ClosingMomentSection), the `src/lib/assets/flow.svg` asset, the `src/routes/brandentry/+page.css` and `+page.server.ts` route files, and the updates to `.voder/history.md` and `.voder/plan.md` in a single commit with a descriptive message.

## NEXT

- Run `npm ci` to install and verify dependencies.  
- Execute `npm run sync && npm run build` to ensure the production build succeeds without errors or warnings.  
- Run `npm run test:ci` to build, start the preview server, and execute all Playwright tests; address any failures.

## LATER

- Develop the animated diff scene inside `src/lib/components/PromptIterationSection.svelte` using GSAP.  
- Add WebGL capability detection in `BrandEntry.svelte` and provide an image fallback for unsupported environments.  
- Conduct a thorough accessibility audit: verify color-contrast ratios, ARIA roles/attributes, and full keyboard navigation support.
