# Project Plan

**Updated**: September 18, 2025  
**Based on**: Implementation Progress Assessment (94.3/100) - 17 of 18 stories complete  
**Current Status**: Outstanding project quality - only production verification automation missing

---

## NOW

**Track untracked story file to restore clean git state**

**Current Situation**: The comprehensive assessment revealed 17 of 18 stories are complete (94.3/100). Only story 014.1-DEV-PROD-VERIFICATION is incomplete (missing `npm run e2e:ci:prod` script). One untracked story file prevents clean git state required before starting new work.

**Immediate Action Required**:
1. **Track the untracked story file**:
   - `git add prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/014.1-DEV-PROD-VERIFICATION.md`
   - Commit message: "feat: add production verification story for automated deployment validation"

2. **Verify clean git state**:
   - Confirm `git status` shows clean working tree
   - Run quality checks to ensure all gates still pass

**Priority**: Critical - Required to restore clean git state for continued development  
**Effort**: 2 minutes  
**Impact**: Enables new story development and maintains systematic development approach

## NEXT

**Complete story 014.1-DEV-PROD-VERIFICATION to achieve 100% story completion**

After restoring clean git state, implement the final missing piece to complete all 18 stories.

**Priority Actions**:
1. **Implement missing npm script**:
   - Add `e2e:ci:prod` script to package.json that runs Playwright tests against https://voder.ai
   - Configure environment variable for production URL targeting
   - Adapt existing screenshot tests to work in production environment
   - Add content validation to detect hosting provider holding pages

2. **Verify complete functionality**:
   - Test the new script works correctly
   - Ensure all 18 stories are fully implemented and functional
   - Run final comprehensive assessment to achieve 95%+ score
   - Update project history with completion milestone

**Priority**: High - Required to complete Release 0.5 with all stories implemented  
**Effort**: 1-2 hours  
**Impact**: Achieves 100% story completion and production verification automation
