# Project Completion Plan

## NOW

**Fix E2E Stability Monitoring Workflow**

The critical blocker is the systematic failure of the `.github/workflows/e2e-stability.yml` workflow. All recent runs fail immediately with "workflow file issue" errors and 0s duration. This must be resolved to complete story 021.4-DEV-CI-STABILITY.

**Specific actions:**
1. Debug the workflow syntax and configuration issues causing immediate failures
2. Test the workflow execution locally and via manual trigger to identify root cause
3. Fix any YAML syntax errors, permission issues, or step configuration problems
4. Ensure the workflow can successfully run E2E tests against production environment (not just preview)
5. Verify the stability data collection and reporting mechanisms work correctly
6. Test that both scheduled (nightly) and manual triggers execute successfully
7. Confirm that historical data preservation is functioning for trend analysis

**Success criteria:** The e2e-stability workflow runs successfully without immediate failure, collects meaningful stability metrics, and generates proper reports with trend data.

## NEXT

**Complete Remaining Implementation Work**

After fixing the E2E stability workflow:

1. Implement production environment testing in the stability workflow (currently only tests preview server)
2. Add historical data preservation mechanism for long-term trend analysis
3. Implement early warning alert system for stability degradation detection
4. Complete any missing functionality identified during the workflow debugging process

## LATER

**Project Completion and Maintenance Setup**

1. Document the completed E2E stability monitoring system
2. Establish ongoing monitoring and maintenance procedures for all completed systems
3. Clean up temporary development artifacts and documentation
4. Prepare project for new development cycles with robust stability foundations
