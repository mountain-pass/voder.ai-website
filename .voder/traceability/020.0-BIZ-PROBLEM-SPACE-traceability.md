## Acceptance Criteria Validation

- [ ] AC1: Single, clear description of AI slop using best-performing LinkedIn post framing | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: src/app.ts lines 20-23 show generic description "Stop AI from turning your codebase into an unmaintainable mess" but lacks specific LinkedIn post framing and detailed problem description
- [ ] AC2: Emotional language that triggers recognition ("That's exactly what happened to me!") | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: Current description is generic and doesn't use emotional language that triggers founder recognition
- [ ] AC3: Specific examples founders can relate to (empty .md files, broken scripts, etc.) | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No specific examples of AI slop problems provided (no mention of empty .md files, broken scripts, etc.)
- [ ] AC4: Simple visual representation of the problem (before/after, chaos illustration) | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No visual representation of the AI slop problem exists in the current implementation
- [ ] AC5: Call-to-action asking "Does this resonate with your experience?" | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No call-to-action asking about resonance - only generic "Join the Waitlist" button
- [x] AC6: Analytics tracking for engagement and emotional response | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: src/traffic-analytics.ts implements comprehensive analytics with Clarity integration for tracking engagement

## Validation Notes
Story validation BLOCKED - Multiple INVALIDATED criteria found. The current implementation lacks the specific AI slop problem description required by the story. The content is too generic and doesn't use the emotional, specific language needed to trigger founder recognition. Missing specific examples, visual representation, and resonance call-to-action.
