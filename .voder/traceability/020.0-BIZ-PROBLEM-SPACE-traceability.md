## Acceptance Criteria Validation

- [ ] AC1: Single, clear description of AI slop using best-performing LinkedIn post framing | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: Current hero section has solution-focused copy "Stop AI from turning your codebase into an unmaintainable mess" but no dedicated problem space section with LinkedIn post framing
- [ ] AC2: Emotional language that triggers recognition ("That's exactly what happened to me!") | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No emotional recognition language present, current copy is solution-oriented rather than problem-empathetic
- [ ] AC3: Specific examples founders can relate to (empty .md files, broken scripts, etc.) | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No specific examples provided, only general "unmaintainable mess" reference
- [ ] AC4: Simple visual representation of the problem (before/after, chaos illustration) | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No visual problem representations, current design is minimal hero section only
- [ ] AC5: Call-to-action asking "Does this resonate with your experience?" | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No resonance CTA, only waitlist signup CTA present
- [ ] AC6: Analytics tracking for engagement and emotional response | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: Analytics system exists with clarity tracking, could track problem section engagement if section existed
