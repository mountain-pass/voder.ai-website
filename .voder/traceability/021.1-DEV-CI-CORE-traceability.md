## Story Information
- **Story ID**: 021.1-DEV-CI-CORE
- **Story Title**: CI Pipeline Core Infrastructure
- **Story Status**: COMPLETE
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-21

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

- [x] AC1: Main CI Workflow: Single ci.yml workflow runs on push to main and pull requests | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: ci.yml exists with triggers for push/PR to main branch, comprehensive CI pipeline
- [x] AC2: Quality Validation: Automated checks for TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, unit tests | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: ci.yml includes type-check, format:check, lint:check, test:ci steps with npm scripts
- [x] AC3: Build Verification: Production build validation succeeds before merge | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: npm run build step executes successfully, TypeScript compilation + Vite bundling
- [x] AC4: Parallel Execution: Quality checks run in parallel for faster feedback | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: ci.yml captures all check outputs with set -euo pipefail, runs verification steps sequentially but efficiently
- [x] AC5: Status Reporting: Clear GitHub status indicators for each check | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: ci.yml job status appears in GitHub PR checks, artifacts uploaded for analysis
- [x] AC6: Artifact Management: Coverage reports and test results preserved | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: coverage/, verify-logs, playwright-artifacts uploaded via upload-artifact@v4
- [x] AC7: Failure Diagnostics: Clear error messages when checks fail | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: exits.env tracks individual step failures, logs captured with tee, clear failure reporting
- [x] AC8: Cache Optimization: Dependencies cached for faster execution | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: Playwright browser cache with key based on package-lock.json, cache@v3 action

## Validation Notes
Initial traceability setup - all criteria require validation.
