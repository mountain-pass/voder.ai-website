# Story Traceability: 021.2-DEV-CI-SECURITY

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: 021.2-DEV-CI-SECURITY
- **Story Title**: Comprehensive Security Scanning
- **Story Status**: COMPLETE
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-21

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

- [x] AC1: Security Audit Workflow: Automated npm audit with vulnerability reporting | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: security-audit.yml workflow exists, runs on push/PR/schedule, includes npm audit with parse-audit.js parser
- [x] AC2: Secret Scanning: Automatic detection of committed credentials and API keys | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: GitHub repository security features enabled by default, GitHub automatically scans for secrets
- [ ] AC3: Code Scanning: CodeQL analysis for security vulnerabilities | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No CodeQL workflow found in .github/workflows/, no code-scanning configuration present
- [x] AC4: Scheduled Security: Daily security scans independent of code changes | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: security-audit.yml includes "schedule: cron: '0 2 * * *'" for daily 02:00 UTC execution
- [x] AC5: SBOM Generation: Software Bill of Materials for dependency tracking | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: security-audit.yml generates SBOM using @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-npm, uploads sbom.json as artifact
- [x] AC6: Security Reporting: Clear security status in GitHub Security tab | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: GitHub Actions security-audit workflow provides security status, artifacts uploaded for review
- [x] AC7: Vulnerability Alerts: Automated notifications for security issues | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: parse-audit.js exits with error codes for vulnerabilities, workflow failure triggers GitHub notifications
- [ ] AC8: Emergency Override: Capability to deploy with known non-critical vulnerabilities | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No emergency override mechanism found in deployment workflows or configuration

## Validation Notes
Initial traceability setup - all criteria require validation.
