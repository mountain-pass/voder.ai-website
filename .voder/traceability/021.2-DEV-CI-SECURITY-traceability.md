# Story Traceability: 021.2-DEV-CI-SECURITY

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: 021.2-DEV-CI-SECURITY
- **Story Title**: Security and Vulnerability Pipeline
- **Story Status**: FAILED
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-22

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

- [x] AC1: Security Audit Workflow - Automated npm audit with vulnerability reporting | Status: PASSED | Evidence: .github/workflows/security-audit.yml exists with npm audit functionality. audit.json shows 0 vulnerabilities detected. Recent runs show success status.
- [x] AC2: Secret Scanning - Automatic detection of committed credentials and API keys | Status: FAILED | Evidence: .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml exists but failing due to gitleaks license requirement. Recent runs show failure: "missing gitleaks license" error.
- [x] AC3: Code Scanning - CodeQL analysis for security vulnerabilities | Status: PASSED | Evidence: .github/workflows/code-scanning.yml exists with CodeQL analysis. Recent runs show success with SARIF upload for security-events.
- [x] AC4: Scheduled Security - Daily security scans independent of code changes | Status: PASSED | Evidence: All security workflows have cron schedules - security-audit at '0 2 * * *', secret-scan at '0 3 * * *', code-scanning at '0 4 * * *'.
- [x] AC5: SBOM Generation - Software Bill of Materials for dependency tracking | Status: PASSED | Evidence: Security audit workflow includes SBOM generation using @cyclonedx/cyclonedx-bom tool.
- [x] AC6: Security Report Generation - Security findings exported and viewable via GitHub CLI | Status: PASSED | Evidence: `gh run list` and `gh run view` show security workflow results. Security artifacts uploaded include audit.json, SARIF files, and scan reports.
- [x] AC7: Vulnerability Alerts - Automated notifications for security issues | Status: PASSED | Evidence: CodeQL workflow has security-events permissions for uploading to GitHub Security tab. Security audit fails job on high severity issues.
- [x] AC8: Emergency Override - Capability to deploy with known non-critical vulnerabilities | Status: PASSED | Evidence: Security workflows allow continuing on some failures and provide override capability through workflow_dispatch triggers.

## Validation Notes
Story 021.2 has FAILED due to acceptance criteria AC2 (Secret Scanning) being in FAILED status. While the secret scanning workflow exists, it is currently failing due to a gitleaks license requirement that prevents the scan from executing. This is a blocking issue that needs to be resolved before the story can be considered complete. All other security components are working properly including npm audit, CodeQL analysis, scheduled scans, SBOM generation, and security reporting.
