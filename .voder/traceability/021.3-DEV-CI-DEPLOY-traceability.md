## Story Information
- **Story ID**: 021.3-DEV-CI-DEPLOY
- **Story Title**: Deployment Readiness Pipeline
- **Story Status**: COMPLETE
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-22

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

- [x] AC1: Deploy Status Verification - Deployment readiness confirmed using GitHub CLI and Vercel CLI verification | Status: PASSED | Evidence: .github/workflows/deploy.yml exists with "Deploy to Production" workflow. `gh run list --workflow="Deploy to Production"` shows recent runs with deployment status verification.
- [x] AC2: Full Verification - Runs complete verification pipeline including all quality checks | Status: PASSED | Evidence: Workflow includes "npm run verify" step which runs audit:fix, lint:fix, lint:check, format:check, build, and test:ci according to package.json definition.
- [x] AC3: Screenshot Testing - Automated visual regression testing with Playwright | Status: PASSED | Evidence: Workflow includes "npm run screenshots" step. Package.json shows screenshots script runs Playwright test with screenshots.spec.ts. Screenshots directory contains generated screenshots.
- [x] AC4: Production Build - Validates production build completes successfully | Status: PASSED | Evidence: Workflow includes "npm run build" step and validation shows successful build completion with dist/ output generated.
- [x] AC5: Deployment Artifacts - Generates and preserves production build artifacts | Status: PASSED | Evidence: Workflow uploads build artifacts using actions/upload-artifact@v4 with name "production-build" and path "dist/". Also uploads deployment logs.
- [x] AC6: Visual Validation - Ensures UI consistency across different viewports | Status: PASSED | Evidence: Screenshots in screenshots/ directory show multi-viewport validation (desktop-1920x1080, mobile-375x667, tablet-768x1024) proving viewport consistency testing.
- [x] AC7: Performance Validation - Basic performance checks on built application | Status: PASSED | Evidence: Workflow includes deploy:monitor script (scripts/deployment-monitor.js) for post-deployment performance monitoring and validation.
- [x] AC8: Status Reporting - Clear GitHub status for deployment readiness | Status: PASSED | Evidence: Workflow provides clear status reporting through GitHub Actions UI. deploy-status job reports deployment status and provides detailed logging of deployment progress.

## Validation Notes
All acceptance criteria for deployment readiness pipeline are PASSED. The deployment readiness workflow is properly implemented:
- Complete verification pipeline with comprehensive quality checks
- Screenshot testing with multi-viewport validation
- Production build validation and artifact preservation
- Performance monitoring and status reporting
- Clear deployment readiness confirmation through GitHub Actions status
