## Story Information
- **Story ID**: 021.3-DEV-CI-DEPLOY
- **Story Title**: Pre-deployment Quality Verification
- **Story Status**: IN_PROGRESS
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-21

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

- [ ] AC1: Deployment Workflow: Single deploy.yml workflow validates deployment readiness | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: .github/workflows/deploy.yml exists with comprehensive build-and-test job
- [ ] AC2: Full Verification: Runs complete verification pipeline including all quality checks | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: deploy.yml runs 'npm run verify' which includes audit:fix → lint:fix → lint:check → format:check → build → test:ci
- [ ] AC3: Screenshot Testing: Automated visual regression testing with Playwright | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: deploy.yml runs 'npm run screenshots' and tests/e2e/screenshots.spec.ts implements comprehensive viewport testing
- [ ] AC4: Production Build: Validates production build completes successfully | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: deploy.yml includes 'npm run build' step with production build validation
- [ ] AC5: Deployment Artifacts: Generates and preserves production build artifacts | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: deploy.yml uploads build artifacts to dist/ using actions/upload-artifact@v4
- [ ] AC6: Visual Validation: Ensures UI consistency across different viewports | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: screenshots.spec.ts tests desktop (1920x1080), tablet (768x1024), mobile (375x667) viewports
- [ ] AC7: Performance Validation: Basic performance checks on built application | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No specific performance validation steps found in deploy.yml beyond build completion
- [ ] AC8: Status Reporting: Clear GitHub status for deployment readiness | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: deploy-status job provides deployment notification with commit details and author info
