## Story Information
- **Story ID**: 021.4-DEV-CI-STABILITY
- **Story Title**: E2E Stability Monitoring
- **Story Status**: COMPLETE
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-22

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

- [x] AC1: Nightly Monitoring - Automated nightly E2E stability testing trackable via GitHub CLI | Status: PASSED | Evidence: .github/workflows/e2e-stability.yml exists with cron schedule '0 3 * * *' for nightly execution. `gh run list --workflow=e2e-stability.yml` shows recent workflow runs.
- [x] AC2: Trend Analysis - Long-term stability trend tracking and reporting | Status: PASSED | Evidence: e2e-stability.json contains trend analysis with averagePassRate, trend, and stability metrics. e2e-stability-history.json maintains historical data entries.
- [x] AC3: Production Validation - Validates actual production environment health | Status: PASSED | Evidence: Workflow includes "Run Production E2E tests" step with `npm run e2e:ci:prod` command for production environment validation.
- [x] AC4: Stability Metrics - Tracks test success rates, performance trends, error patterns | Status: PASSED | Evidence: e2e-stability.json contains comprehensive stats (total, passed, failed, flaky), pass rates, and alert levels. Historical tracking in e2e-stability-history.json.
- [x] AC5: Early Warning - Alerts when stability trends indicate degradation | Status: PASSED | Evidence: e2e-stability.json includes alertLevel (MEDIUM), warnings array, and trend analysis for degradation detection.
- [x] AC6: Historical Data - Maintains historical stability data for analysis | Status: PASSED | Evidence: e2e-stability-history.json contains timestamped entries with historical stats and artifact counts for trend analysis.
- [x] AC7: Manual Triggering - Support for on-demand stability validation | Status: PASSED | Evidence: Workflow includes `workflow_dispatch: {}` trigger allowing manual execution via GitHub Actions UI or CLI.
- [x] AC8: Stability Reports - Generate comprehensive stability analysis reports | Status: PASSED | Evidence: Workflow uploads e2e-stability-report artifacts containing e2e-stability.json, e2e-stability.txt, and e2e-stability-history.json files.
