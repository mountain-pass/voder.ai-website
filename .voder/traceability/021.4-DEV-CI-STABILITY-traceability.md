# Story Traceability: 021.4-DEV-CI-STABILITY

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: 021.4-DEV-CI-STABILITY
- **Story Title**: E2E Stability Monitoring
- **Story Status**: FAILED
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-22

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

- [x] AC1: Nightly Monitoring - Automated nightly E2E stability testing trackable via GitHub CLI | Status: PASSED | Evidence: .github/workflows/e2e-stability.yml exists with cron schedule '0 3 * * *' and workflow_dispatch, trackable via `gh run list --workflow=e2e-stability.yml`
- [ ] AC2: Trend Analysis - Long-term stability trend tracking and reporting | Status: FAILED | Evidence: While generate-e2e-stability-summary.js exists, all recent workflow runs fail immediately (0s duration) with "workflow file issue" - no trend data is being collected
- [ ] AC3: Production Validation - Validates actual production environment health | Status: FAILED | Evidence: Workflow configured for local preview server testing, not production environment validation
- [ ] AC4: Stability Metrics - Tracks test success rates, performance trends, error patterns | Status: FAILED | Evidence: e2e-stability.json shows all zeros (total: 144, passed: 0, failed: 0, flaky: 0) - no actual metrics collected due to workflow failures
- [ ] AC5: Early Warning - Alerts when stability trends indicate degradation | Status: FAILED | Evidence: No working stability data collection means no early warning capability
- [ ] AC6: Historical Data - Maintains historical stability data for analysis | Status: FAILED | Evidence: Only current snapshot files exist (e2e-stability.json/txt), no historical data preservation mechanism working
- [ ] AC7: Manual Triggering - Support for on-demand stability validation | Status: PASSED | Evidence: workflow_dispatch trigger present in e2e-stability.yml allows manual triggering
- [ ] AC8: Stability Reports - Generate comprehensive stability analysis reports | Status: FAILED | Evidence: While generate-e2e-stability-summary.js exists and produces reports, the workflow failures prevent meaningful report generation

## Validation Notes
**CRITICAL FAILURE**: The e2e-stability workflow has systematic execution failures. All recent runs (17893023484, 17874321513, etc.) fail immediately with "workflow file issue" and 0s duration. While the infrastructure exists (workflow file, scripts, artifact handling), the core functionality is broken and no stability monitoring is actually occurring. This story cannot be considered complete until the workflow execution issues are resolved.
