# Story Traceability: 021.4-DEV-CI-STABILITY

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: 021.4-DEV-CI-STABILITY
- **Story Title**: E2E Stability Monitoring
- **Story Status**: IN_PROGRESS
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-21

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

- [ ] AC1: Nightly Monitoring: Automated nightly E2E stability testing | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: .github/workflows/e2e-stability.yml configured with cron schedule '0 3 * * *' for daily 03:00 UTC execution
- [ ] AC2: Trend Analysis: Long-term stability trend tracking and reporting | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: .github/scripts/generate-e2e-stability-summary.js implements stability data collection and reporting
- [ ] AC3: Production Validation: Validates actual production environment health | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: Workflow tests against preview server (npm run preview) not actual production https://voder.ai
- [ ] AC4: Stability Metrics: Tracks test success rates, performance trends, error patterns | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: generate-e2e-stability-summary.js tracks stats.total, artifacts, and test results
- [ ] AC5: Early Warning: Alerts when stability trends indicate degradation | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: verify-e2e-stability.sh provides failure detection and reporting mechanisms
- [ ] AC6: Historical Data: Maintains historical stability data for analysis | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: Workflow uploads stability artifacts (e2e-stability.json, e2e-stability.txt) for historical tracking
- [ ] AC7: Manual Triggering: Support for on-demand stability validation | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: Workflow configured with 'workflow_dispatch: {}' enabling manual execution
- [ ] AC8: Stability Reports: Generate comprehensive stability analysis reports | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: generate-e2e-stability-summary.js creates comprehensive JSON and text reports

## Validation Notes
Story 021.4-DEV-CI-STABILITY: 7/8 criteria VALIDATED, 1 INVALIDATED. Comprehensive stability monitoring implemented with nightly schedule, reporting, and manual triggers. Only production validation missing (tests preview instead of live production).
