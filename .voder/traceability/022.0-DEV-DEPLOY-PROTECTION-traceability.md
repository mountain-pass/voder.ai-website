# Story Traceability: 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION
- **Story Title**: Vercel Deployment Quality Gates
- **Story Status**: IN_PROGRESS
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-21

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

- [ ] AC1: Quality Gate Integration: Vercel waits for GitHub Actions CI completion before deploying | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: vercel.json shows basic deployment config but no CI status check integration or deployment protection configuration
- [ ] AC2: Deployment Blocking: Failed GitHub Actions prevent Vercel deployment to production | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No deployment protection mechanisms found in vercel.json or GitHub repository settings
- [ ] AC3: Trunk-Based Compatibility: Works with direct commits to main branch (no branch protection required) | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: Current deployment auto-deploys on main commits without CI gates
- [ ] AC4: Preview Deployments: Pull request preview deployments remain unaffected | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No specific preview deployment configuration found
- [ ] AC5: Manual Override: Emergency deployment capability when quality checks are non-critical | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No emergency override mechanism configured
- [ ] AC6: Status Visibility: Clear deployment status showing quality check results | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No CI status integration visible in deployment pipeline
- [ ] AC7: Fast Feedback: Deployment starts immediately after successful CI completion | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: Deployments currently happen without waiting for CI completion
- [ ] AC8: Rollback Capability: Failed deployments can be quickly rolled back | Status: INVALIDATED | Evidence: No documented rollback mechanism for failed deployments

## Validation Notes
Story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION: ALL criteria INVALIDATED - Vercel deployment protection not implemented. Current vercel.json shows basic deployment configuration without CI status check integration, deployment blocking, or quality gates.
