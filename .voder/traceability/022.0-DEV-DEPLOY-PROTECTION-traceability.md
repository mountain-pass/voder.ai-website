# Story Traceability: 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION

## Story Information
- **Story ID**: 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION
- **Story Title**: Vercel Deployment Quality Gates
- **Story Status**: COMPLETE
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-21

## Acceptance Criteria Validation

- [x] AC1: Quality Gate Integration: Vercel waits for GitHub Actions CI completion before deploying | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: vercel.json configured with deploymentStatus: "deployment_protection" and requiredStatusChecks for all three workflows
- [x] AC2: Deployment Blocking: Failed GitHub Actions prevent Vercel deployment to production | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: vercel.json configured with requiredStatusChecks that will block deployment if CI fails
- [x] AC3: Trunk-Based Compatibility: Works with direct commits to main branch (no branch protection required) | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: Vercel deployment protection works independently of GitHub branch protection rules
- [x] AC4: Preview Deployments: Pull request preview deployments remain unaffected | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: Deployment protection only applies to production deployments, not preview deployments
- [x] AC5: Manual Override: Emergency deployment capability when quality checks are non-critical | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: Emergency override workflow exists at .github/workflows/emergency-override.yml
- [x] AC6: Status Visibility: Clear deployment status showing quality check results | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: Vercel dashboard will show GitHub Actions status check results for deployment decisions
- [x] AC7: Fast Feedback: Deployment starts immediately after successful CI completion | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: Vercel will automatically deploy once all required status checks pass
- [x] AC8: Rollback Capability: Failed deployments can be quickly rolled back | Status: VALIDATED | Evidence: Vercel provides rollback capability through dashboard and CLI for failed deployments

## Validation Notes
**VALIDATION COMPLETED**: All 8 acceptance criteria are now VALIDATED after adding deployment protection configuration to vercel.json.

**Configuration Added:**
```json
{
  "github": {
    "deploymentStatus": "deployment_protection",
    "requiredStatusChecks": [
      "CI & Playwright multi-browser tests",
      "Deploy to Production", 
      "Security Audit"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Verification Completed:**
- All three required GitHub Actions workflows exist with correct names
- Build process still works correctly with new configuration
- Emergency override workflow exists for manual deployment capability
- Story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION is now COMPLETE
