# Security Incident Report

**Date**: 2025-09-30
**Incident**: Hardcoded secrets committed to git history
**Status**: RESOLVED - Secrets removed from current codebase

## Summary

During security assessment, hardcoded API keys and tokens were discovered in the `.env` file. Investigation revealed that secrets were also committed to git history in multiple commits.

## Affected Commits

- `b0a0fae` (latest code) - contained OPENAI_API_KEY and SENTRY_DSN
- `8d18871` (big cleanup and reset) - contained secrets
- `0618595` (removed secrets) - attempted cleanup

## Compromised Credentials

The following types of credentials were exposed:

- OpenAI API keys
- Sentry DSN
- Microsoft Clarity tokens
- GitLeaks license keys
- Vercel deployment tokens
- Netlify authentication tokens

## Resolution Actions Taken

1. âœ… Removed all hardcoded secrets from `.env` file
2. âœ… Created `.env.example` template for development setup
3. âœ… Verified `.env` is properly ignored in `.gitignore`
4. âœ… Documented security incident

## Required Follow-up Actions

**IMMEDIATE** (for repository owner):

1. **Rotate ALL exposed credentials**:
   - Generate new OpenAI API key
   - Regenerate Sentry DSN
   - Create new Microsoft Clarity API token
   - Update GitLeaks license
   - Regenerate Vercel token
   - Create new Netlify auth token

2. **Review access logs** for potential unauthorized usage of exposed credentials

3. **Consider git history rewriting** if this is an internal repository (consult with team first)

## Prevention Measures

1. âœ… Environment variables properly templated in `.env.example`
2. âœ… `.env` file properly ignored in version control
3. ðŸ”„ Team training on secure credential management (pending)
4. ðŸ”„ Automated secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline (pending)

## Notes

- Secrets have been backed up to `.env.backup` for reference during credential rotation
- All current functionality will need environment variables to be properly configured
- This incident highlights the importance of never committing secrets to version control
