# @voder/problem-space-section Needs for Voder Website Application

This document outlines the specific requirements that the `@voder/voder-website` application has for the `@voder/problem-space-section` component, focusing on the application-specific needs beyond what is documented in problem-space-section.md.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Application-Specific Requirements**

### **Problem Awareness Transition**

The main application needs the problem space section to effectively transition users from philosophical alignment to concrete problem recognition:

```typescript
interface ProblemAwarenessNeeds {
  // Bridge from philosophical foundation to concrete problems
  bridgePhilosophyToProblems(bridging: {
    fromSection: 'the-why-section';
    toSection: 'metaphor-section';
    transitionTone: 'contemplative philosophy â†’ strategic problem awareness';
    problemProgression: 'intent-first belief â†’ current reality challenges â†’ solution need';
    userMindsetShift: 'philosophical alignment â†’ problem recognition â†’ readiness for solution';
  }): Promise<void>;
  
  // Establish problem space framing for solution narrative
  establishProblemFraming(framing: {
    problemCategories: [
      'overwhelming complexity',
      'tool fragmentation', 
      'low-level focus',
      'communication bottlenecks'
    ];
    visualStrategy: 'controlled chaos that demonstrates without overwhelming';
    strategicMessaging: 'precise problem identification for founder/CTO audience';
    solutionSetup: 'problems that directly map to Voder capabilities';
  }): void;
  
  // Coordinate timing for visual chaos demonstration
  orchestrateChaosVisualization(chaos: {
    chaosIntensity: 'graduated escalation tied to scroll progress';
    problemRevealSequence: 'complexity â†’ fragmentation â†’ low-level focus â†’ bottlenecks';
    visualMetaphors: 'tangled webs, scattered pieces, forest for trees, broken telephone';
    accessibilityAlternative: 'clear textual problem statements for screen readers';
  }): Promise<void>;
}
```

### **Strategic Problem Communication**

The application needs the section to communicate problems strategically to the target audience of decision-makers:

```typescript
interface StrategicCommunicationNeeds {
  // Align problem messaging with business impact
  alignBusinessImpactMessaging(alignment: {
    audienceLevel: 'founders, CTOs, and innovation leaders';
    problemsFraming: 'strategic barriers not technical complaints';
    businessConsequences: [
      'slower time to market',
      'increased development costs',
      'reduced innovation capacity',
      'stakeholder misalignment'
    ];
    competitiveDisadvantage: 'teams spending time on tools instead of products';
  }): void;
  
  // Coordinate messaging hierarchy for executive resonance
  establishExecutiveMessaging(messaging: {
    primaryProblem: 'Intent gets lost in translation between stakeholders and code';
    supportingProblems: [
      'Multiple frameworks create cognitive overload for teams',
      'Tool fragmentation prevents effective collaboration',
      'Low-level focus diverts attention from business logic'
    ];
    impactStatements: 'time, money, and competitive advantage lost to complexity';
    rhetoricalStructure: 'current reality â†’ business impact â†’ solution readiness';
  }): void;
  
  // Position problems for Voder solution mapping
  positionForSolutionMapping(positioning: {
    intentTranslationProblem: 'directly addressed by prompt-to-code capability';
    complexityProblem: 'simplified through intelligent code generation';
    fragmentationProblem: 'unified through single prompt interface';
    focusProblem: 'elevated to business intent level through Voder abstraction';
  }): void;
}
```

### **Visual Chaos Orchestration**

The application needs the section to demonstrate problems through controlled visual chaos that supports rather than overwhelms the narrative:

```typescript
interface VisualChaosOrchestrationNeeds {
  // Coordinate chaos visualization with website experience
  orchestrateChaosExperience(chaos: {
    chaosProgression: {
      entry: 'subtle introduction of visual tension';
      escalation: 'gradual increase in particle system complexity';
      peak: 'controlled chaos demonstrating problem severity';
      resolution: 'calming transition toward solution readiness';
    };
    performanceManagement: {
      adaptiveParticleCount: 'responsive to device capability and screen size';
      automaticQualityReduction: 'maintain 30fps minimum for smooth experience';
      reducedMotionSupport: 'static visualization alternative for accessibility';
    };
    narrativeSupport: {
      chaosAsMetaphor: 'visual representation of development complexity';
      problemVisualization: 'particle behavior matching problem categories';
      accessibilityDescription: 'meaningful text alternatives for visual chaos';
    };
  }): Promise<void>;
  
  // Integrate chaos timing with scroll-tied progression
  integrateScrollTiedChaos(integration: {
    scrollTriggerConfiguration: {
      startPoint: 'top 80% for initial problem introduction';
      escalationPoint: 'middle 50% for chaos peak demonstration';
      endPoint: 'bottom 20% for calming transition';
      scrubValue: 'smooth 1.5 second scrub for deliberate chaos progression';
    };
    chaosPhases: {
      introduction: 'first 25% of scroll - subtle visual tension';
      demonstration: 'middle 50% of scroll - peak chaos visualization';
      resolution: 'final 25% of scroll - calming toward solution readiness';
    };
    reversibilitySupport: 'chaos animations reverse smoothly when scrolling backward';
  }): void;
  
  // Coordinate visual design system for problem demonstration
  coordinateProblemVisualization(visualization: {
    backgroundTreatment: {
      primary: '#0A0A0A';  // Voder Black for dramatic contrast
      chaosColor: '#FF6B6B'; // Problem Red for chaos elements
      secondaryText: '#C6CBD4'; // Cool Grey maintaining 11.7:1 contrast
      accentHighlights: '#24D1D5'; // Soft Teal Glow for solution hints
    };
    chaosDesignLanguage: {
      particlePhysics: 'erratic movement representing fragmentation';
      colorDistortion: 'subtle hue shifts suggesting instability';

    demonstrationVsFunction: 'chaos serves narrative purpose without hindering navigation';
    engagementVsMaintained: 'problems create concern but not abandonment';
    accessibilitySupport: 'clear alternatives for users who cannot see visual chaos';
  }): Promise<void>;
  
  // Coordinate problem emotional journey
  coordinateEmotionalJourney(journey: {
    entryState: 'philosophical alignment and readiness to hear problems';
    problemAwareness: 'growing recognition of development workflow issues';
    chaosImpact: 'visceral understanding of complexity without personal frustration';
    exitState: 'problem awareness and readiness for solution explanation';
    toneMaintenance: 'strategic analysis not emotional manipulation';

    investorPerspective: 'market opportunity and solution necessity focus';
  }): void;
}
```

### **Application State Coordination**

      accessibilityUsage: 'reduced motion and alternative visualization usage';
    };
  }): void;
}
```

### **Testing and Quality Assurance Coordination**

The application needs the section to support comprehensive testing of both functional and experiential aspects:

```typescript
