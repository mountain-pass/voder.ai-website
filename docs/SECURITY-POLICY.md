# Security Policy and Vulnerability Management

## Overview

This document defines the security policies and procedures for vulnerability management in the voder.ai website project, including criteria for vulnerability acceptance, incident documentation requirements, and risk management procedures.

## Vulnerability Management Policy

### Automated Security Scanning

All dependencies MUST be continuously monitored for security vulnerabilities through:

- **npm audit** integration in CI/CD pipelines
- **Pre-commit security checks** as part of quality gates
- **Regular dependency updates** with security patch prioritization

### Vulnerability Response Framework

#### Immediate Response (All Vulnerabilities)

1. **Detection**: Automated scanning identifies vulnerability
2. **Assessment**: Determine severity, scope, and impact
3. **Documentation**: Create formal security incident using template
4. **Decision**: Apply vulnerability acceptance criteria or plan remediation

#### Vulnerability Acceptance Criteria

**Vulnerabilities MAY be accepted as residual risk when ALL of the following conditions are met:**

1. **Age Criterion**: Vulnerability is less than **14 days old** (from first detection date)
2. **Patch Availability**: **No security patch is available** from the package maintainer
3. **Documentation**: Vulnerability is **formally documented as a security incident** using `prompt-assets/security-incident-template.md`
4. **Risk Assessment**: **Formal risk assessment completed** and documented in the security incident
5. **Monitoring**: **Periodic monitoring established** for patch availability

#### Mandatory Remediation Requirements

**Outside of acceptance criteria, we MUST:**

- **Stop using the dependency** (find and implement alternative), OR
- **Implement strong and effective controls** to reduce residual risk to acceptable levels

#### Universal Application

**This policy applies to ALL dependencies regardless of:**

- ✅ Development dependencies AND production dependencies
- ✅ Direct dependencies AND transitive dependencies
- ✅ Critical, high, medium, AND low severity vulnerabilities
- ✅ First-party AND third-party packages

### Security Incident Documentation

#### Documentation Requirements

**Only vulnerabilities that are ACCEPTED as residual risk MUST be documented as formal security incidents:**

- **Template**: `prompt-assets/security-incident-template.md`
- **Location**: `docs/security-incidents/SECURITY-INCIDENT-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{brief-description}.{status}.md`
- **Status Tracking**: DETECTED → INVESTIGATING → CONTAINED → RESOLVED → CLOSED

**Vulnerabilities that are immediately patched or resolved do NOT require formal security incident documentation** - standard commit messages and change logs are sufficient for those cases.

#### When Security Incident Documentation is Required

**CREATE formal security incident documentation when:**

1. Vulnerability meets acceptance criteria and will be accepted as residual risk
2. Vulnerability requires strong controls implementation due to lack of available patches
3. Vulnerability involves dependency replacement/migration due to lack of patches

**DO NOT create security incident documentation when:**

1. Vulnerability can be immediately patched via `npm audit fix`
2. Vulnerability is resolved by updating to a patched version
3. Vulnerability is fixed through normal dependency updates

#### What NOT to Use for Security Documentation

**Work state documents are NOT sufficient for security documentation:**

- ❌ `docs/history.md` (project history, not security documentation)
- ❌ `.voder/implementation-progress.md` (work state, not permanent documentation)
- ❌ Commit messages or PR descriptions (not formal incident tracking)
- ❌ Chat logs or informal communications (not auditable documentation)

#### Required Security Incident Content

Each security incident (for accepted vulnerabilities) MUST include:

1. **Incident Classification**: Severity, impact assessment, business/technical impact
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: 5 Whys analysis to understand vulnerability source
3. **Risk Assessment**: Formal evaluation of risk level and acceptance rationale
4. **Timeline**: Detection, investigation, containment, resolution phases
5. **Evidence**: Logs, configuration snapshots, dependency trees
6. **Prevention Measures**: Controls implemented to prevent recurrence
7. **Monitoring Plan**: Ongoing monitoring for patches and risk changes

### Risk Management Framework

#### Risk Assessment Factors

When evaluating vulnerability acceptance, consider:

**Technical Risk Factors:**

- Dependency scope (development vs. production)
- Attack vector complexity and likelihood
- Potential impact on system confidentiality, integrity, availability
- Existing security controls and mitigations

**Business Risk Factors:**

- Operational continuity impact
- Alternative dependency availability and migration effort
- Service availability requirements
- Compliance and regulatory implications

**Temporal Risk Factors:**

- Age of vulnerability (14-day acceptance window)
- Patch development timeline from maintainer
- Threat landscape changes and exploit availability

#### Risk Mitigation Controls

When vulnerabilities are accepted, implement appropriate controls:

**Technical Controls:**

- Network segmentation and access controls
- Input validation and sanitization
- Monitoring and anomaly detection
- Backup and recovery procedures

**Process Controls:**

- Regular vulnerability reassessment
- Patch monitoring and notification systems
- Incident response plan testing
- Security awareness training

**Administrative Controls:**

- Access management and least privilege
- Change management procedures
- Security incident documentation and review
- Vendor security assessment processes

### Monitoring and Review

#### Accepted Vulnerability Monitoring

For all accepted vulnerabilities:

1. **Weekly Patch Checks**: Monitor for available security patches
2. **Risk Reassessment**: Evaluate if risk profile has changed
3. **14-Day Review**: Mandatory review at 14-day mark for continued acceptance
4. **Escalation Triggers**: Automatic escalation if new exploits or patches become available

#### Process Review and Improvement

- **Monthly Security Review**: Assess security incident trends and policy effectiveness
- **Quarterly Policy Review**: Update vulnerability acceptance criteria based on threat landscape
- **Annual Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive review of security posture and policy framework

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **Pre-Development**: Run `npm audit` before starting work
2. **During Development**: Monitor security warnings from tooling
3. **Pre-Commit**: Ensure security checks pass in quality gates
4. **Vulnerability Discovery**:
   - If can be patched: Apply patch and document in commit message
   - If cannot be patched: Create security incident documentation and follow acceptance criteria

### For Security Team

1. **Incident Response**: Follow security incident template only for accepted vulnerabilities
2. **Risk Assessment**: Apply formal risk assessment framework for unpatchable vulnerabilities
3. **Decision Documentation**: Clearly document acceptance or remediation decisions for unpatchable vulnerabilities
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Establish monitoring for accepted vulnerabilities

### For Project Management

1. **Security Planning**: Include security incident resolution in sprint planning
2. **Risk Communication**: Ensure stakeholders understand security risk decisions
3. **Compliance Tracking**: Monitor adherence to 14-day acceptance windows
4. **Resource Allocation**: Prioritize security remediation based on risk assessment

- **Incident History**: `docs/security-incidents/`
- **Development Setup**: `docs/DEVELOPER-SETUP.md` (npm audit procedures)

## Policy Compliance

This policy is mandatory for all project contributors and MUST be followed for any security vulnerability discovery or management decisions. Non-compliance with vulnerability acceptance criteria or documentation requirements may result in security incidents being escalated and development activities being blocked until proper procedures are followed.
