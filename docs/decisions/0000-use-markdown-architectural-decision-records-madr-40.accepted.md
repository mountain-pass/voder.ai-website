# Use Markdown Architectural Decision Records (MADR 4.0)

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to record architectural decisions made in this project independent whether decisions concern the architecture ("architectural decision record"), the code, or other fields. Which format and structure should these records follow?

## Decision Drivers

- Need for structured capturing of any decision
- Implicit assumptions should be made explicit
- Design documentation is important to enable people understanding the decisions later on
- Format should be lean and fit our development style
- Structure should be comprehensible and facilitate usage & maintenance
- Template should be actively maintained and vivid

## Considered Options

- MADR 4.0.0 – The Markdown Architectural Decision Records
- Michael Nygard's template – The first incarnation of the term "ADR"
- Sustainable Architectural Decisions – The Y-Statements
- Other templates listed at <https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record>
- Formless – No conventions for file format and structure

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MADR 4.0.0", because it provides structured capturing of any decision, the format is lean and fits our development style, the structure is comprehensible and facilitates usage & maintenance, and the MADR project is actively maintained.

### Consequences

- Good, because implicit assumptions are made explicit through structured documentation
- Good, because design documentation enables people to understand decisions later on
- Good, because MADR allows for structured capturing of any decision
- Good, because the MADR format is lean and fits our development style
- Good, because the MADR structure is comprehensible and facilitates usage & maintenance
- Good, because the MADR project is vivid and actively maintained
- Neutral, because team members need to learn the MADR format structure
