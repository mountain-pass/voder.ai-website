# Adopt Istanbul as Coverage Engine for Vitest

## Context and Problem Statement

Vitest supports multiple coverage providers for measuring test coverage: V8 and Istanbul. The project requires comprehensive coverage measurement to meet the 80% coverage threshold across all metrics (statements, branches, functions, lines). The most appropriate coverage engine should provide accurate measurements, good tooling support, and flexibility for our testing strategy.

The choice of coverage engine affects:

- Coverage measurement accuracy and granularity
- Support for coverage exclusion comments
- Integration with testing strategies (especially subprocess testing)
- Tooling ecosystem and third-party integrations
- Performance characteristics during test execution

## Decision Drivers

- **Coverage Accuracy**: Engine must provide precise measurement of all coverage metrics
- **Exclusion Support**: Must support fine-grained coverage exclusion for CLI-only code paths
- **Testing Strategy Compatibility**: Must work well with dual testing approach (unit + integration)
- **Tooling Ecosystem**: Should have mature tooling and good documentation
- **Performance**: Should not significantly slow down test execution
- **Future Flexibility**: Should support potential migration to different testing approaches

## Considered Options

1. **V8 Coverage Provider**
2. **Istanbul Coverage Provider**

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "**Istanbul Coverage Provider**", because it offers superior coverage exclusion capabilities, mature tooling ecosystem, and better flexibility for complex testing scenarios, despite slightly slower performance compared to V8.

### Consequences

- **Good**, because Istanbul provides comprehensive coverage exclusion comments (`/* istanbul ignore if */`, `/* istanbul ignore next */`, etc.)
- **Good**, because Istanbul has a mature ecosystem with excellent tooling (nyc, etc.)
- **Good**, because Istanbul integrates well with various testing strategies and frameworks
- **Good**, because Istanbul provides detailed coverage reports with multiple output formats
- **Good**, because Istanbul supports fine-grained control over what gets measured
- **Bad**, because Istanbul is slightly slower than V8 coverage due to instrumentation overhead
- **Neutral**, because both providers meet basic coverage measurement requirements

### Confirmation

Implementation compliance can be confirmed by:

- **Vitest Configuration**: `@vitest/coverage-istanbul` package installed and configured
- **Coverage Exclusion**: Istanbul ignore comments work correctly for CLI-only code
- **Coverage Reports**: All coverage metrics (statements, branches, functions, lines) are measured accurately
- **Test Performance**: Test execution remains within acceptable performance bounds
- **Integration**: Coverage works correctly with both unit and integration test strategies

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### V8 Coverage Provider

**Default Vitest provider** using Node.js built-in V8 coverage capabilities.

- **Good**, because it's the default Vitest provider with zero additional dependencies
- **Good**, because it's faster than Istanbul due to native V8 integration
- **Good**, because it provides accurate basic coverage measurement
- **Good**, because it has minimal configuration requirements
- **Bad**, because it has limited coverage exclusion capabilities
- **Bad**, because it provides fewer options for customizing coverage behavior
- **Bad**, because it has a smaller ecosystem of specialized tools
- **Bad**, because it offers fewer report format options

**Technical Assessment**: V8 coverage is fast and accurate but lacks the flexibility needed for complex testing scenarios, particularly around coverage exclusion for CLI-only code paths.

### Istanbul Coverage Provider

**Third-party provider** using the Istanbul.js instrumentation framework.

- **Good**, because it provides comprehensive coverage exclusion comments:
  - `/* istanbul ignore if */`: ignore the next if statement
  - `/* istanbul ignore else */`: ignore the else portion of an if statement
  - `/* istanbul ignore next */`: ignore the next statement/function/class
  - `/* istanbul ignore file */`: ignore an entire source file
- **Good**, because it has a mature and extensive tooling ecosystem (nyc, etc.)
- **Good**, because it offers multiple report formats (text, html, lcov, json, etc.)
- **Good**, because it provides fine-grained control over instrumentation behavior
- **Good**, because it integrates well with various testing frameworks and CI systems
- **Bad**, because it requires additional dependency (`@vitest/coverage-istanbul`)
- **Bad**, because it's slower than V8 due to instrumentation overhead
- **Neutral**, because it requires slightly more configuration than V8

**Technical Assessment**: Istanbul provides the flexibility and exclusion capabilities needed for our dual testing strategy, particularly for handling CLI-only code paths that cannot be unit tested.

## More Information

### Technical Investigation Results

**Coverage Exclusion Requirements**: During investigation of subprocess coverage collection (ADR-0010), it became clear that scripts need fine-grained coverage exclusion for CLI-only code paths. Istanbul's exclusion comments are essential for maintaining high coverage while acknowledging untestable code sections.

**Performance Comparison**:

- V8: Faster execution, minimal overhead
- Istanbul: Slightly slower due to instrumentation, but difference is negligible for most test suites

**Ecosystem Maturity**:

- V8: Newer, smaller ecosystem, built into Node.js
- Istanbul: Established ecosystem with years of development and widespread adoption

**Integration with Testing Strategy**: Istanbul's exclusion capabilities are crucial for the dual testing strategy (ADR-0010), allowing scripts to maintain high coverage while excluding minimal CLI-only code paths.

### Configuration Implementation

```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    coverage: {
      provider: 'istanbul',
      reporter: ['text', 'html', 'lcov'],
      exclude: [
        '**/node_modules/**',
        '**/dist/**',
        '**/*.test.ts',
        '**/*.spec.ts',
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

### Package Dependencies

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@vitest/coverage-istanbul": "^3.2.4"
  }
}
```

**Decision Confidence**: High - based on clear requirements for coverage exclusion capabilities and alignment with dual testing strategy needs.

**Future Reevaluation Triggers**:

- V8 coverage provider adds comprehensive exclusion comment support
- Performance requirements change to prioritize speed over flexibility
- Testing strategy changes to eliminate need for coverage exclusion
- New coverage providers become available with superior capabilities
