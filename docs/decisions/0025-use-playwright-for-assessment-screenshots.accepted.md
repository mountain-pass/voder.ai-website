# Use Playwright for Assessment Screenshots

## Context and Problem Statement

The assessment process requires visual documentation of the website at different scroll positions and viewport sizes to verify responsive design, brand implementation, and overall user experience quality. Currently, there is no systematic way to capture screenshots for assessment documentation, making it difficult to validate visual requirements and track visual regression across development cycles.

## Decision Drivers

- Need for consistent, reproducible screenshots across different viewport sizes
- Integration with existing development workflow and quality gates
- Support for multiple scroll positions to verify full-page layouts
- Automation capability for CI/CD pipeline integration
- Maintenance of existing technology stack coherence
- Performance and reliability for regular assessment cycles

## Considered Options

- Playwright automated screenshots
- Puppeteer headless Chrome automation
- CLI-based screenshot tools (shot-scraper, pageres-cli)
- Browser automation services (Percy, Chromatic)
- Manual browser screenshots

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Playwright automated screenshots", because it integrates seamlessly with our existing modern development stack, provides programmatic control for multiple viewports and scroll positions, and can be automated as part of our quality assessment pipeline.

### Consequences

- Good, because integrates with existing testing infrastructure without additional dependencies
- Good, because provides precise control over viewport sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Good, because supports full-page captures and specific scroll position screenshots
- Good, because can be automated in CI/CD pipeline for consistent assessment documentation
- Good, because handles dynamic content and SPA rendering correctly
- Good, because supports multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) for cross-browser validation
- Bad, because requires initial setup and test configuration
- Bad, because adds complexity to the development workflow
- Neutral, because screenshots will need storage and organization strategy

### Confirmation

Implementation success will be confirmed by:

- Screenshots generated at multiple viewport sizes (desktop 1920x1080, tablet 768x1024, mobile 375x667)
- Full-page screenshots capturing entire website content
- Scroll position screenshots for content verification
- Integration with npm script for easy execution (`npm run screenshots`)
- Screenshots stored in organized directory structure for assessment use
- Automated execution capability for CI/CD integration

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Playwright automated screenshots

- Good, because leverages existing modern development tooling philosophy
- Good, because provides comprehensive viewport and scroll control
- Good, because integrates with existing quality gates and CI pipeline
- Good, because handles dynamic content rendering correctly
- Good, because supports multiple browsers for validation
- Bad, because requires test framework setup and maintenance
- Bad, because larger learning curve than simple CLI tools

### Puppeteer headless Chrome automation

- Good, because provides fine-grained control over Chrome rendering
- Good, because well-established API for screenshot automation
- Neutral, because similar capabilities to Playwright but Chrome-only
- Bad, because adds another dependency to the stack
- Bad, because limited to Chromium browser family

### CLI-based screenshot tools

- Good, because simple to set up and use for manual testing
- Good, because requires minimal configuration
- Bad, because limited integration with existing development workflow
- Bad, because less precise control over scroll positions and dynamic content
- Bad, because typically single-viewport focused

### Browser automation services

- Good, because professional screenshot and visual testing features
- Good, because minimal setup and maintenance overhead
- Bad, because external service dependency and potential cost
- Bad, because less control over screenshot timing and customization
- Bad, because requires account setup and API key management

### Manual browser screenshots

- Good, because no additional tooling or setup required
- Good, because full control over specific visual conditions
- Bad, because not reproducible or consistent across team members
- Bad, because time-consuming and error-prone for regular assessments
- Bad, because cannot be automated or integrated with CI/CD

## More Information

This decision supports the systematic assessment methodology established in the project by providing reliable visual documentation for the FUNCTIONALITY and EXECUTION assessment criteria. Screenshots will be particularly valuable for validating responsive design implementation and brand consistency requirements in business content stories like 013.0-BIZ-BRAND-ENTRY.

The implementation should follow the existing project standards for console-first diagnostics and be integrated as a quality tool alongside the current linting, formatting, and testing infrastructure.
