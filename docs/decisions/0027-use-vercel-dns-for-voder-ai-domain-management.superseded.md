# Use Vercel DNS for voder.ai Domain Management

> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED**: This decision has been superseded by [ADR-0032: Switch from Vercel to Netlify for Integrated Form Handling](0032-switch-from-vercel-to-netlify-for-integrated-form-handling.accepted.md). The project has switched to Netlify hosting, which will handle domain and DNS management through Netlify's infrastructure.

## Context and Problem Statement

The voder.ai domain is registered with Namecheap and needs DNS configuration to point to Vercel for the static website deployment. We must choose a DNS provider that offers reliable performance, security features, and ease of management for our production website.

The domain currently uses Namecheap's default nameservers (dns1.registrar-servers.com, dns2.registrar-servers.com) and requires an A record pointing to Vercel's IP (76.76.21.21) to complete the deployment.

## Decision Drivers

- DNS resolution performance and global distribution critical for website speed
- Reliability and uptime requirements for production website availability
- Security features needed to protect against DNS-based attacks
- Cost considerations for startup budget constraints
- Management complexity and ease of configuration
- Integration capabilities with Vercel deployment platform
- Analytics and monitoring features for DNS performance tracking
- Future scalability for additional domains and subdomains

## Considered Options

- Namecheap Basic DNS
- Cloudflare DNS
- Vercel DNS
- Amazon Route 53
- Google Cloud DNS

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Vercel DNS", because it provides seamless integration with our Vercel deployment platform, eliminates the need for third-party DNS configuration, and simplifies the deployment workflow while maintaining professional-grade DNS performance.

### Consequences

- Good, because seamless integration with Vercel deployment platform eliminates configuration complexity
- Good, because automatic optimization for Vercel-hosted sites with no manual DNS record management
- Good, because unified management within Vercel dashboard reduces operational overhead
- Good, because automatic SSL certificate management and domain verification
- Good, because eliminates dependency on additional third-party services
- Good, because Vercel's global edge network provides reliable DNS performance
- Good, because no additional cost beyond domain registration
- Neutral, because DNS features limited to Vercel ecosystem requirements
- Bad, because vendor lock-in to Vercel platform for DNS management
- Bad, because fewer advanced DNS features compared to specialized providers like Cloudflare
- Bad, because less flexibility for future non-Vercel deployments

### Confirmation

DNS configuration success confirmed by:

- voder.ai domain automatically configured in Vercel DNS after nameserver change
- SSL certificate issued automatically by Vercel after DNS verification
- Website loads at https://voder.ai with Vercel's optimized routing
- DNS propagation completed within 24 hours globally
- Vercel dashboard showing domain status as verified and active
