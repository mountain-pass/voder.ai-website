# Duplicate Prevention Process

## Overview

This document outlines the process for preventing duplicate architectural decisions and maintaining a clean, well-organized ADR system. It establishes procedures for validation, cleanup, and ongoing maintenance of decision records.

## Duplicate Prevention Philosophy

### Systematic Organization

The ADR system should be:

- **Uniquely Numbered**: No duplicate decision numbers
- **Topic-Coherent**: No overlapping decisions on same architectural area
- **Well-Cross-Referenced**: Related decisions explicitly linked
- **Easy to Navigate**: Clear organization that supports quick searches

### Proactive Prevention

Focus on preventing duplicates rather than cleaning them up after creation through:

- **Pre-creation Review**: Check for existing decisions before creating new ones
- **Clear Scope Definition**: Ensure each decision has well-defined boundaries
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Maintain links between related decisions
- **Regular Maintenance**: Ongoing cleanup to prevent accumulation

## Number Management

### Sequential Numbering System

All decisions follow sequential numbering:

- **Format**: 4-digit zero-padded numbers (0000, 0001, 0002, etc.)
- **No Gaps**: Numbers assigned sequentially without skipping
- **No Reuse**: Never reuse numbers from deleted decisions
- **Single Source**: Centralized tracking of next available number

### Number Assignment Process

1. **Check Current Maximum**: Identify highest existing decision number
2. **Assign Next Sequential**: Use next number in sequence
3. **Reserve Number**: Mark number as assigned during decision creation
4. **Validate Uniqueness**: Confirm no existing file with same number

### Number Validation

Before creating new decision:

- **File Scan**: Check docs/decisions/ for existing numbers
- **Pattern Verification**: Ensure filename follows numbering convention
- **Conflict Resolution**: If conflict found, use next available number
- **Documentation Update**: Record number assignment for tracking

## Topic Area Management

### Scope Definition

Each decision should have:

- **Clear Problem Statement**: Specific architectural issue being addressed
- **Defined Boundaries**: What is and isn't covered by this decision
- **Context Specificity**: Particular circumstances that apply
- **Technology Scope**: Which technologies or areas are affected

### Overlap Detection

Before creating new decision, check for:

- **Similar Problem Statements**: Decisions addressing same architectural concern
- **Technology Overlap**: Decisions covering same technology areas
- **Implementation Conflicts**: Decisions that would contradict each other
- **Scope Creep**: Decisions that have grown beyond original boundaries

### Topic Area Coverage

Maintain awareness of:

- **Existing Coverage**: What architectural areas already have decisions
- **Gap Areas**: Topics that need decisions but don't have them yet
- **Overlap Zones**: Areas where multiple decisions might intersect
- **Evolution Needs**: Topics where existing decisions may need updates

## Pre-Creation Review Process

### Decision Proposal Review

Before creating new ADR:

1. **Search Existing Decisions**: Review all current ADRs for related topics
2. **Identify Related Decisions**: Find decisions that touch on similar areas
3. **Assess Overlap**: Determine if proposed decision duplicates existing ones
4. **Define Differentiation**: Clearly articulate how new decision differs
5. **Plan Cross-References**: Identify which existing decisions to reference

### Search Strategies

Use multiple approaches to find related decisions:

- **Keyword Search**: Search decision titles and content for relevant terms
- **Category Review**: Check decisions in same technology or process area
- **Timeline Analysis**: Review recent decisions that might overlap
- **Cross-Reference Following**: Follow links from related decisions

### Overlap Resolution

When overlap is found:

- **Update Existing**: Modify existing decision if new information available
- **Supersede Existing**: Create new decision that replaces old one
- **Narrow Scope**: Reduce scope of proposed decision to avoid overlap
- **Document Relationship**: Clearly explain relationship between decisions

## Cleanup Procedures

### Regular Maintenance

Monthly cleanup activities:

- **Number Audit**: Verify all decisions have unique, sequential numbers
- **Filename Validation**: Ensure all files follow naming convention
- **Content Review**: Check for decisions that may have become duplicates
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verify all decision links are valid

### Duplicate Detection

Systematic approach to find duplicates:

- **Automated Scanning**: Use scripts to identify numbering issues
- **Content Analysis**: Review decisions for overlapping problem statements
- **Manual Review**: Human validation of potential duplicates
- **Team Input**: Gather feedback on confusing or overlapping decisions

### Cleanup Actions

When duplicates are found:

1. **Assess Content**: Determine which decision has better content
2. **Merge Information**: Combine valuable information from both decisions
3. **Update References**: Fix any cross-references to deprecated decision
4. **Archive Duplicate**: Move duplicate to archived location
5. **Document Cleanup**: Record what was cleaned up and why

### File Management

For duplicate removal:

- **Use Git Operations**: Use `git mv` and `git rm` to preserve history
- **Maintain Redirects**: Add redirects from old locations if necessary
- **Update Documentation**: Modify any documentation that referenced duplicates
- **Communicate Changes**: Notify team of removed decisions

## Naming Convention Enforcement

### Filename Standards

All decision files must follow:

- **Pattern**: `<ID>-<kebab-case-title>.<status>.md`
- **ID Format**: 4-digit zero-padded number
- **Title Format**: Kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- **Status Inclusion**: Current status as part of filename
- **Extension**: Always `.md` for Markdown format

### Title Guidelines

Decision titles should be:

- **Descriptive**: Clearly indicate what decision covers
- **Concise**: Short enough for easy scanning
- **Unique**: Distinguishable from other decision titles
- **Stable**: Unlikely to need changes that require file renaming

### Status Management

File status in filename:

- **Proposed**: New decisions under consideration
- **Accepted**: Endorsed decisions in active use
- **Deprecated**: Superseded decisions no longer recommended
- **Rejected**: Decisions that were considered but not adopted
- **Superseded**: Decisions replaced by specific newer decisions

## Validation Automation

### Automated Checks

Create scripts to validate:

- **Number Uniqueness**: No duplicate decision numbers
- **Filename Format**: All files follow naming convention
- **Sequential Numbering**: No gaps in number sequence
- **Status Consistency**: Status in filename matches content
- **Cross-Reference Validity**: All decision links point to existing files

### Integration with Workflow

Integrate validation into:

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Validate before commits
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Check during build process
- **Regular Scripts**: Automated periodic validation
- **Manual Reviews**: Include validation in review process

### Error Reporting

When validation fails:

- **Clear Error Messages**: Specific information about what's wrong
- **Suggested Fixes**: Recommendations for resolving issues
- **Automated Fixes**: Where possible, auto-fix simple issues
- **Manual Review Triggers**: Flag complex issues for human review

## Cross-Reference Management

### Reference Standards

All decision cross-references should:

- **Use Decision Numbers**: Reference by ID rather than title (more stable)
- **Include Context**: Brief explanation of why decision is referenced
- **Maintain Currency**: Keep references up-to-date as decisions evolve
- **Bi-directional Links**: Reference from both decisions when appropriate

### Reference Validation

Regularly verify:

- **Link Accuracy**: All references point to existing decisions
- **Relevance**: References still make sense in current context
- **Completeness**: All relevant relationships are documented
- **Consistency**: Related decisions reference each other appropriately

## Continuous Improvement

### Process Evolution

This duplicate prevention process is regularly reviewed for:

- **Effectiveness**: Whether duplicates are actually prevented
- **Efficiency**: How to prevent duplicates with less overhead
- **Automation Opportunities**: What manual steps can be automated
- **Team Adoption**: Whether teams follow the process consistently

### Success Metrics

Track process success through:

- **Duplicate Rate**: Number of duplicates created per time period
- **Cleanup Frequency**: How often cleanup activities are needed
- **Detection Speed**: How quickly duplicates are identified
- **Team Satisfaction**: Whether process helps or hinders team productivity

### Feedback Integration

Improve process based on:

- **Team Experience**: Feedback from decision creators and reviewers
- **Tool Effectiveness**: Whether automated checks catch real issues
- **Maintenance Burden**: Cost of maintaining clean ADR system
- **Value Delivery**: Whether clean system actually improves decision making
