# Exemption Tracking Process

## Overview

This document defines the process for tracking exemptions as experiments within the standards cultivation system. Exemptions are encouraged as valuable opportunities to discover better approaches and improve our standards.

## Exemption Philosophy

### Experiments, Not Failures

Exemptions represent experiments that can lead to improved standards. They are:

- **Innovation opportunities**: Chances to discover better approaches
- **Learning mechanisms**: Ways to validate or challenge existing standards
- **Improvement drivers**: Sources of feedback for standards evolution

### Encouraging Exemptions

We actively encourage exemptions when developers have legitimate reasons and commit to documenting results. This creates a healthy feedback loop for standards improvement.

## Exemption Request Process

### When to Request Exemption

Request exemption when:

- Technical constraints make standard compliance impractical
- Business requirements conflict with current standards
- Experimental approach may yield better results
- Alternative approach offers significant advantages

### Exemption Criteria

Exemptions are granted when developers demonstrate:

1. **Non-trivial Reason**: Legitimate technical or business justification beyond convenience
2. **Experiment Commitment**: Agreement to document experiment setup, execution, and results
3. **Contribution Promise**: Willingness to propose new standard if experiment succeeds

### Request Format

Submit exemption requests with:

- **Decision Reference**: Which standard requires exemption
- **Reason**: Clear explanation of why exemption is needed
- **Experiment Plan**: How the alternative approach will be tested
- **Success Criteria**: How success/failure will be measured
- **Timeline**: Expected duration of experiment
- **Documentation Commitment**: Agreement to document results

## Tracking Implementation

### Documentation Location

All exemptions are tracked within the corresponding ADR file in an "Exemptions" section:

```markdown
## Exemptions

### Exemption 001: [Brief Description]

- **Granted**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Requestor**: [Name/Team]
- **Reason**: [Explanation]
- **Experiment Plan**: [Approach being tested]
- **Success Criteria**: [How success will be measured]
- **Timeline**: [Expected duration]
- **Status**: [Ongoing/Completed/Abandoned]
- **Results**: [Documented outcomes - populated when completed]
```

### Exemption Numbering

Within each decision:

- Sequential numbering (001, 002, etc.)
- Unique per decision
- No reuse of numbers within same decision

### Status Tracking

Track exemption status:

- **Ongoing**: Experiment in progress
- **Completed**: Experiment finished with documented results
- **Abandoned**: Experiment stopped before completion
- **Extended**: Timeline extended with justification

## Experiment Execution

### During Experiment

Developers should:

- **Document Progress**: Regular updates on experiment status
- **Track Metrics**: Collect data according to success criteria
- **Note Challenges**: Record obstacles and unexpected issues
- **Share Learnings**: Communicate insights with team during experiment

### Experiment Duration

- **Default Timeline**: 3 months unless otherwise specified
- **Extension Process**: Request extension with updated justification
- **Early Completion**: Document results if conclusions reached early
- **Abandonment**: Document reasons if experiment cannot continue

## Results Documentation

### Required Documentation

When experiment completes, document:

1. **Approach Summary**: What was actually implemented
2. **Metrics Results**: Quantitative outcomes vs. success criteria
3. **Qualitative Assessment**: Team experience and subjective feedback
4. **Comparison**: How approach compared to original standard
5. **Challenges**: Obstacles encountered and how resolved
6. **Recommendations**: Suggested improvements to standards

### Documentation Format

Update exemption entry with results:

```markdown
- **Results**:
  - **Approach**: [What was implemented]
  - **Metrics**: [Quantitative results]
  - **Experience**: [Team feedback and observations]
  - **Comparison**: [vs. original standard]
  - **Challenges**: [Issues encountered]
  - **Recommendation**: [Propose new standard/keep current/modify]
```

### Follow-up Actions

Based on results:

- **Successful Experiment**: Submit proposal for new/updated standard
- **Failed Experiment**: Document lessons learned, strengthen original standard
- **Mixed Results**: Propose modifications to existing standard
- **Inconclusive**: Extend experiment or try different approach

## Review and Analysis

### Exemption Threshold Review

When a standard accumulates 3+ exemptions:

1. **Automatic Review**: Standard flagged for mandatory review
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Examine common reasons for exemptions
3. **Standard Assessment**: Evaluate if standard needs updating
4. **Community Input**: Gather broader team feedback on standard effectiveness

### Regular Exemption Analysis

Monthly review process:

- **Active Experiments**: Check progress on ongoing exemptions
- **Overdue Results**: Follow up on completed experiments missing documentation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify trends across multiple exemptions
- **Standards Health**: Assess which standards are working well vs. struggling

## Integration with Standards Evolution

### Feedback Loop

Exemption results feed directly into standards evolution:

- **Successful Patterns**: Become basis for new standards
- **Common Failures**: Strengthen rationale for existing standards
- **Edge Cases**: Inform standard modifications or exceptions
- **Usage Patterns**: Guide standard simplification or clarification

### Proposal Generation

From exemption results:

- **New Standards**: Successful experiments become proposals
- **Standard Updates**: Modifications based on experiment learnings
- **Standard Deprecation**: Standards that consistently fail in practice
- **Exception Handling**: Formal provisions for known edge cases

## Quality Assurance

### Tracking Completeness

Ensure all exemptions:

- Have complete initial documentation
- Include realistic timelines and success criteria
- Are updated regularly during experiment
- Conclude with comprehensive results documentation

### Experiment Integrity

Maintain experiment quality through:

- **Clear Success Criteria**: Measurable, objective outcomes
- **Appropriate Timeline**: Realistic duration for meaningful results
- **Regular Check-ins**: Periodic status updates
- **Honest Documentation**: Accurate reporting of both positive and negative results

## Continuous Improvement

### Process Evolution

This exemption tracking process is itself subject to:

- Regular review based on usage patterns
- Updates based on team feedback
- Simplification when bureaucracy emerges
- Enhancement when tracking gaps identified

### Success Metrics

Track process effectiveness through:

- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of exemptions with documented results
- **Value Generation**: Number of standards improved through exemption feedback
- **Team Satisfaction**: Developer experience with exemption process
- **Standards Health**: Overall improvement in standards quality over time
