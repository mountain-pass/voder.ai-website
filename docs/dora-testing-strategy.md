# This script demonstrates how to run comprehensive cross-browser testing efficiently

echo "ðŸš€ DORA-Optimized E2E Testing Strategy"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“Š Current Test Performance Analysis:"
echo "â€¢ Total tests: 293 (73 tests Ã— 4 browsers)"
echo "â€¢ Current runtime: ~43 minutes"
echo "â€¢ Main bottlenecks:"
echo " - waitForLoadState('networkidle') - very slow in CI"
echo " - Fixed waitForTimeout() calls"
echo " - Heavy 3D performance tests on all browsers"
echo " - Screenshot tests on every browser"
echo ""

echo "ðŸŽ¯ DORA-Aligned Optimization Strategy:"
echo ""

echo "1. PARALLEL EXECUTION"
echo " â€¢ Increase workers from default to maximize CI resources"
echo " â€¢ Shard tests across multiple CI machines"
echo ""

echo "2. SMART TEST DISTRIBUTION"
echo " â€¢ Core functionality: All browsers (fast tests only)"
echo " â€¢ Performance tests: Chromium only (representative)"
echo " â€¢ Visual tests: Chromium + WebKit (covers rendering engines)"
echo " â€¢ Mobile-specific: Mobile browsers only"
echo ""

echo "3. WAIT OPTIMIZATION"
echo " â€¢ Replace networkidle with faster alternatives"
echo " â€¢ Use page.waitForFunction() instead of fixed timeouts"
echo " â€¢ Reduce unnecessary waits"
echo ""

echo "4. STAGED TESTING"
echo " â€¢ Pre-deployment: Critical path tests (5-10 min)"
echo " â€¢ Post-deployment: Comprehensive cross-browser (async)"
echo ""

echo "ðŸ“ˆ Expected Results:"
echo "â€¢ Deployment pipeline: 5-10 minutes (90% reduction)"
echo "â€¢ Full cross-browser coverage maintained"
echo "â€¢ Zero compromise on quality"
echo "â€¢ Better DORA metrics (lead time, deployment frequency)"
