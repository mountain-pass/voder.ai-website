# 3D Cube Responsive Positioning Issue

**Date**: 2025-09-27  
**Updated**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: ✅ CLOSED  
**Resolution Date**: 2025-09-28  
**Severity**: ~~Medium~~ → Fixed  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Affected 51.9% of page views (mobile + tablet users, per MS Clarity Data Export API - no tablet users in period)  
**Likelihood**: High (3) - Occurred consistently on mobile/tablet viewports  
**Priority**: 6 (Medium×High) - Was high priority, immediate fix implemented  
**Component**: 3D Animation System (`src/three-animation.ts`, `src/style.css`)

## Problem Description (RESOLVED)

~~The 3D cube animation appears incorrectly positioned on mobile and tablet viewports:~~

- **Desktop (>768px)**: Cube renders centered and properly sized ✅
- **Tablet (≤768px)**: ~~Cube appears in bottom-right area, oversized~~ → **Fixed: Proper proportions with wider FOV** ✅
- **Mobile (≤480px)**: ~~Cube appears in bottom-right corner, oversized~~ → **Fixed: Proper proportions with wider FOV** ✅

## Final Resolution

**Issue**: 3D cube appeared oversized/cropped on mobile and tablet viewports due to incorrect camera field-of-view calculations and positioning.

**Root Cause**: JavaScript camera FOV calculations were too narrow (45°/55°) causing zoomed-in appearance, combined with incorrect camera positioning that cropped the cube.

**Solution**: Corrected Three.js camera calculations:

- **Mobile FOV**: 45° → 75° (wider angle shows complete cube)
- **Tablet FOV**: 55° → 70° (wider angle shows complete cube)
- **Camera positioning**: Adjusted z-distance and y-position for proper framing across all viewports

## Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)

**Why #1: Why is the cube positioned incorrectly on mobile/tablet?**

- Because the canvas appears to be much wider than expected on smaller screens

**Why #2: Why is the canvas wider than the viewport on mobile/tablet?**

- Because there's a CSS media query conflict

**Why #3: Why is there a CSS media query conflict?**

- Because the CSS has responsive rules that override the full viewport styling

**Why #4: Why do these responsive rules override the full viewport approach?**

- Because the media query `@media (width <= 768px)` sets `.hero-animation` to `height: 150px; width: 150px;` which conflicts with the full viewport `width: 100vw; height: 100vh;`

**Why #5: Why wasn't this caught in earlier investigation?**

- Because focus was on JavaScript camera/FOV positioning instead of examining the CSS cascade and responsive overrides

## Technical Root Cause

**CSS Conflict**:

```css
/* Base rule (line 474-479) */
.hero-animation {
  position: relative;
  width: 100vw; /* Full viewport width */
  height: 100vh; /* Full viewport height */
  margin: 0 0 -100vh 0;
}

/* Conflicting responsive override (line 555-558) */
@media (width <= 768px) {
  .hero-animation {
    height: 150px; /* Forces small container */
    width: 150px; /* Forces small container */
  }
}
```

**Result**:

- **Container**: 150px × 150px (CSS override)
- **Canvas**: Full viewport dimensions (JS: `window.innerWidth` × `window.innerHeight`)
- **Mismatch**: Canvas overflows container, causing cube to appear bottom-right

## Impact

- Mobile/tablet users see broken 3D animation
- Degrades user experience on primary traffic sources
- Contradicts the full viewport background design intention
- Makes the elegant glass cube effect unusable on smaller screens

## Files Affected

1. **`src/style.css`** (lines 555-558): Conflicting responsive rules
2. **`src/three-animation.ts`** (lines 88-89, 143): Canvas sizing logic
3. **`prompts/release-1.0/in-scope/025.0-BIZ-3D-ANIMATION.md`**: Specification assumes full viewport works responsively

## Investigation History

1. **Initial attempts**: Focused on camera positioning and FOV adjustments
2. **Misdiagnosis**: Assumed WebGL/Three.js camera calculation issues
3. **Correct diagnosis**: CSS cascade inspection revealed container size conflict

## Workarounds for Release

While fixing the root cause, consider these temporary solutions to enable release:

### Option 1: Disable 3D on Mobile/Tablet (Recommended)

**Impact**: Low risk, preserves performance
**Implementation**:

```javascript
// In src/three-animation.ts constructor
const isMobileOrTablet = window.innerWidth <= 768;
if (isMobileOrTablet) {
  this.initFallback(); // Use 2D fallback immediately
  return;
}
```

**Pros**: No visual glitches, fast implementation, good UX
**Cons**: Mobile users miss 3D effect (but may prefer performance)

### Option 2: Quick CSS Override

**Impact**: Medium risk, may cause layout shifts
**Implementation**:

```css
/* Add to src/style.css */
@media (width <= 768px) {
  .hero-animation {
    width: 100vw !important;
    height: 100vh !important;
  }
}
```

**Pros**: Maintains 3D on all devices
**Cons**: Uses `!important`, may have side effects

### Option 3: JavaScript Container Sizing

**Impact**: Medium risk, runtime overhead
**Implementation**:

```javascript
// In src/three-animation.ts initThreeJS()
this.container.style.width = '100vw';
this.container.style.height = '100vh';
this.container.style.position = 'fixed';
this.container.style.top = '0';
this.container.style.left = '0';
```

**Pros**: Overrides CSS programmatically
**Cons**: May conflict with other styles

### Option 4: Conditional Full Viewport

**Impact**: Low risk, clean separation
**Implementation**:

```css
/* Replace existing media query */
@media (width <= 768px) {
  .hero-animation.fallback-mode {
    height: 150px;
    width: 150px;
  }

  .hero-animation.fullscreen-mode {
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
  }
}
```

**Pros**: Clean CSS, explicit control
**Cons**: Requires JS class management

### Recommendation: Option 1 + Option 4

1. **Immediate release**: Use Option 1 to disable 3D on mobile/tablet
2. **Next iteration**: Implement Option 4 for proper responsive 3D
3. **Long term**: Fix root cause by cleaning up CSS architecture

## Final Implementation (2025-09-28) ✅ COMPLETED

**Solution**: Corrected JavaScript Camera Calculations

- **All viewports (Mobile/Tablet/Desktop)**: 3D cube renders with proper proportions
- **Technical fix**: JavaScript FOV and camera positioning corrections, not CSS workarounds
- **User Experience**: Consistent, elegant 3D cube animation across all device sizes

**Files Modified**:

- `src/three-animation.ts`: Corrected FOV calculations (75°/70°/65° for mobile/tablet/desktop) and camera positioning
- `src/style.css`: Reverted CSS workarounds, maintained original full viewport approach
- `tests/e2e/screenshots.spec.ts`: All screenshot tests verify proper 3D cube rendering

**Test Results**: ✅ All tests passing (142 unit tests, 44 E2E screenshot tests)
**Git Commit**: `dcfb275` - "Fix 3D cube viewport sizing - correct camera positioning"

## Resolution Steps ✅ COMPLETED

### ~~Immediate (for release):~~ ✅ COMPLETED

1. ~~Implement Option 1 workaround to disable 3D on mobile/tablet~~ → **Superseded by proper fix**
2. ~~Test that 2D fallback renders correctly on all viewports~~ → **Not needed - 3D works on all viewports**
3. ~~Update documentation to reflect temporary mobile limitation~~ → **Updated to reflect full resolution**

### ~~Short term (next sprint):~~ ✅ COMPLETED

1. ~~Remove or modify conflicting CSS media query rules~~ → **CSS architecture maintained, no conflicts**
2. ~~Ensure consistent full viewport approach across all screen sizes~~ → **Achieved via JavaScript fixes**
3. ~~Validate fix with viewport screenshot tests~~ → **All 44 E2E tests passing**
4. ~~Update specification to reflect CSS requirements~~ → **Issue was JavaScript, not CSS**

### ~~Long term:~~ → **Not needed - root cause resolved**

1. ~~Refactor CSS responsive architecture~~ → **CSS architecture was correct**
2. ~~Add CSS-JS coordination tests~~ → **Existing screenshot tests provide coverage**
3. ~~Document viewport canvas patterns~~ → **Pattern working correctly**

## Lessons Learned

- **Initial misdiagnosis**: CSS was suspected but the root cause was JavaScript camera calculations
- **Visual debugging importance**: User screenshot feedback was crucial for identifying the actual issue (oversized cube vs. positioning)
- **Camera FOV principles**: Narrow FOV (45°/55°) creates zoomed-in effect; wider FOV (75°/70°) shows complete objects
- **Three.js responsive patterns**: Camera positioning and FOV must be adjusted together for different viewport sizes
- **Test coverage value**: Comprehensive E2E screenshot tests (44 tests across 3 browsers × 3 viewports) catch visual regressions effectively
- **5 Whys limitation**: Technique led down CSS path initially; direct visual analysis was more effective
