- Becomes worse with longer page engagement times
- Affects both initial render and ongoing animations

## User Experience Impact

- **Mobile Users**: Severely degraded experience with choppy cube rotation and scroll lag affecting overall site usability
- **Desktop Users**: Scroll interruptions create jarring user experience, breaking reading flow
- **Low-End Devices**: Potential tab freezing or significant performance degradation
- **Business Impact**: Poor performance may increase bounce rates and reduce engagement with site content

## Analytics-Based Impact Assessment

**Affected User Percentage**: 100% of page views  
**Data Source**: Performance observation across devices  
**Device Breakdown**:

- Mobile: 100% (most severely affected)
- Desktop: 100% (moderate scroll lag)
- Tablet: 100% (moderate performance issues)

**Impact Calculation**: All users viewing the page experience the 3D cube and its associated performance costs

## Technical Analysis

### Investigation Tasks

#### High Priority

- [ ] **Analyze WebGL rendering pipeline**: Profile GPU usage and identify bottlenecks in Three.js rendering
- [ ] **Review volumetric caustics shader performance**: Complex fragment shader may be causing GPU overload
- [ ] **Audit scroll event handling**: Investigate scroll-to-rotation mapping causing main thread blocking

#### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Optimize device-specific configurations**: Review mobile vs desktop rendering parameters
- [ ] **Evaluate animation frame management**: Analyze requestAnimationFrame usage and potential optimization
- [ ] **Test material complexity impact**: Assess glass material, environment mapping, and shader complexity

#### Low Priority

- [ ] **Implement performance monitoring**: Add FPS tracking and performance metrics
- [ ] **Research progressive enhancement**: Consider fallback options for low-performance devices

### Files Likely Affected

1. **src/three-animation.ts**: Primary file containing WebGL rendering, animation loops, and scroll interactions
2. **src/app.ts**: Application initialization that may need performance checks
3. **tests/three-animation\*.test.ts**: Performance-related test files for validation

### Root Cause Hypothesis

Multiple performance bottlenecks likely contributing to the issues:

1. **Complex volumetric caustics shader**: The flowing ribbon caustics use intensive raymarching and noise calculations that may overwhelm mobile GPUs
2. **Inefficient scroll handling**: Direct scroll-to-rotation mapping without throttling may cause main thread blocking
3. **High-frequency animation updates**: Continuous animation frame requests with complex shader uniform updates
4. **Unoptimized material complexity**: Glass material with environment mapping and multiple light sources may be too demanding

## Workaround Implementation

## Root Cause Analysis

### Methodology Used

- [x] **5 Whys Analysis**
- [x] **Performance Profiling**
- [x] **Shader Analysis**
- [x] **Controlled Experiments**

### Analysis Results

**PRIMARY ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: **Extremely Complex Fragment Shader**

The `causticPattern()` function in the volumetric raymarching shader is performing **massive computational workload** that overwhelms GPUs across all device types:

#### Computational Complexity Analysis

**Per-Pixel Calculations in `causticPattern()`**:

- **15+ noise function calls** per pixel per raymarching step
- **Multiple flow field computations** (2 complete flow fields)
- **3 separate ribbon calculations** with organic thickness variation
- **6 energy modulation calculations** (sin/cos/length operations)
- **Complex mathematical operations**: smoothstep, length, dot products

**Performance Impact Calculation**:

- **Desktop (40 steps)**: 40 √ó 15+ noise calls = **600+ calculations per pixel**
- **Mobile (8-10 steps)**: 10 √ó 15+ noise calls = **150+ calculations per pixel**
- **1920√ó1080 display**: ~2M pixels √ó 600+ calculations = **~1.2 billion calculations per frame**
- **60 FPS target**: **~72 billion calculations per second**

This explains why even Story 026.1's mobile optimization (8-10 steps) still causes performance issues.

#### Confirmed Root Causes

1. **Shader Complexity Overwhelming All GPUs** (Primary)
   - **Evidence**: Even with 8 raymarching steps on mobile, caustics pattern still computationally expensive
   - **Impact**: Desktop with 40 steps becomes completely unresponsive during scroll
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - Core bottleneck identified

2. **Story 026.1 Insufficient Optimization** (Secondary)
   - **Evidence**: Device detection working but still using complex shader on all devices
   - **Impact**: Mobile optimization helps but doesn't address fundamental shader complexity
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - Partial solution, needs deeper optimization

3. **Animation Loop Overhead** (Contributing)
   - **Evidence**: Continuous time uniform updates every frame (`performance.now() / 1000`)
   - **Impact**: Additional GPU work on top of already expensive shader
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - Compounds the primary issue

4. **No Frame Rate Limiting** (Contributing)
   - **Evidence**: No adaptive quality or frame rate targeting
   - **Impact**: System attempts to maintain 60fps regardless of computational cost
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - Missing performance safeguards

#### Technical Evidence

**Shader Complexity Breakdown**:

```glsl
// causticPattern() function performs per pixel:
vec3 flow1 = vec3(
  noise(pos + vec3(time * 0.8, 0.0, 0.0)) * 2.0 - 1.0,  // 3 noise calls
  noise(pos + vec3(0.0, time * 0.6, 0.0)) * 2.0 - 1.0,  // + complex math
  noise(pos + vec3(0.0, 0.0, time * 0.7)) * 2.0 - 1.0   // per flow field
);
// Plus flow2, 3 ribbons, 3 thickness calculations, 3 energy calculations
// Total: 15+ expensive operations per pixel per raymarching step
```

**Performance Test Evidence**:

- Mobile Chrome: 2.1s with optimization vs timeout without
- Desktop shows scroll lag even with optimizations
- GPU stall warnings persist across all device types

#### Business Impact Analysis

**Current State Assessment**:

- **Story 026.1**: Implemented but insufficient - reduces steps but not fundamental complexity
- **Problem 009**: Still KNOWN ERROR status - desktop scroll lag persists
- **User Experience**: Mobile improved but desktop still has "scroll pause/lag"
- **Development Impact**: Complex shader makes any performance tuning extremely difficult

## Failing Test (Critical for Problem Validation)

### Test Details

**Test Type**: E2E Performance Test / Automated Testing  
**Test Location**: tests/e2e/3d-cube-performance.spec.ts (‚úÖ CREATED)

    // This test FAILS when shader complexity is too high
    // Validates 25 second performance budget
    // Reproduces original timeout issue
  });

  test('should complete Mobile Chrome operations quickly with PERFORMANCE_MODE enabled', () => {
    // This test PASSES with performance optimizations
    // Validates 15 second optimized budget

## Problem Context

This performance issue affects the core visual experience of the website's 3D glass cube feature. The cube includes complex volumetric caustics with flowing ribbon patterns that create a stunning visual effect but at significant performance cost. The issue is particularly critical as it affects 100% of users and directly impacts core user interactions like scrolling, which is fundamental to website navigation.

Priority should be given to mobile optimization as mobile users experience the most severe degradation, while maintaining the visual quality that makes the feature compelling on capable devices.
