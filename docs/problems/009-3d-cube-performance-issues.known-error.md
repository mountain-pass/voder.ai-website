- Tablet: 100% (moderate performance issues)

**Impact Calculation**: All users viewing the page experience the 3D cube and its associated performance costs

## Technical Analysis

### Investigation Tasks

#### High Priority

- [ ] **Analyze WebGL rendering pipeline**: Profile GPU usage and identify bottlenecks in Three.js rendering
- [ ] **Review volumetric caustics shader performance**: Complex fragment shader may be causing GPU overload
- [ ] **Audit scroll event handling**: Investigate scroll-to-rotation mapping causing main thread blocking

#### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Optimize device-specific configurations**: Review mobile vs desktop rendering parameters
- [ ] **Evaluate animation frame management**: Analyze requestAnimationFrame usage and potential optimization
- [ ] **Test material complexity impact**: Assess glass material, environment mapping, and shader complexity

#### Low Priority

- [ ] **Implement performance monitoring**: Add FPS tracking and performance metrics
- [ ] **Research progressive enhancement**: Consider fallback options for low-performance devices

### Files Likely Affected

1. **src/three-animation.ts**: Primary file containing WebGL rendering, animation loops, and scroll interactions
2. **src/app.ts**: Application initialization that may need performance checks
3. **tests/three-animation\*.test.ts**: Performance-related test files for validation

### Root Cause Hypothesis

Multiple performance bottlenecks likely contributing to the issues:

1. **Complex volumetric caustics shader**: The flowing ribbon caustics use intensive raymarching and noise calculations that may overwhelm mobile GPUs
2. **Inefficient scroll handling**: Direct scroll-to-rotation mapping without throttling may cause main thread blocking
3. **High-frequency animation updates**: Continuous animation frame requests with complex shader uniform updates
4. **Unoptimized material complexity**: Glass material with environment mapping and multiple light sources may be too demanding

## Workaround Implementation

### Status

- ‚úÖ **Workaround Identified**: Feature flag to disable raymarching caustics completely
- ‚úÖ **Test Management Completed**: E2E tests now pass with dramatic performance improvement
- ‚úÖ **Workaround Implemented**: ENABLE_RAYMARCHING_CAUSTICS feature flag set to false
- ‚úÖ **Tests Re-enabled**: Previously failing tests now pass consistently
- ‚úÖ **Performance Impact Eliminated**: 90%+ performance improvement (30s timeout ‚Üí 2.6s completion)
- ‚úÖ **Visual Quality Preserved**: Beautiful glass cube maintained, only volumetric caustics disabled
- ‚úÖ **Workaround Verified**: Dramatic performance improvement confirmed via testing

### Workaround Details

**Type**: Feature Flag Disable of Raymarching Caustics  
**Implementation**: Simple boolean flag to bypass expensive volumetric rendering

**Immediate Fixes Applied**:

**Technical Implementation**:

```typescript
// In src/three-animation.ts createVolumeLightCaustics():
const ENABLE_RAYMARCHING_CAUSTICS = false; // TODO: Set to true once performance is optimized

if (!ENABLE_RAYMARCHING_CAUSTICS) {
  console.log('Raymarching caustics disabled via feature flag for performance');
  return;
}
// ... rest of volumetric caustics code preserved but not executed
```
