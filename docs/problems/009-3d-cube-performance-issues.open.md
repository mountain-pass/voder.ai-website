**Date**: 2025-10-08  
**Updated**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: ðŸ”´ OPEN  
**Severity**: High  
**Impact**: High (3) - 100% of page views affected by performance degradation during cube interactions  
**Likelihood**: High (3) - Consistent occurrence across device types  
**Priority**: 9 (3Ã—3) - Critical, immediate optimization required  
**Component**: 3D Animation System, WebGL Rendering, Scroll Interaction

## Problem Description

The 3D glass cube with flowing ribbon caustics experiences significant performance issues that degrade user experience across multiple interaction scenarios. Users report stuttering animations, scroll lag, and general interface unresponsiveness during cube interactions.

**Symptoms**:

- Cube rotation does not animate smoothly on mobile devices, appearing jerky or stuttering
- Desktop browsers experience noticeable scroll pause/lag when scrolling upward past the cube
- Frame rate drops during cube animation loops with flowing caustics
- Potential browser tab freezing on lower-end devices

**Conditions**:

- Occurs on all devices but more pronounced on mobile
- Most noticeable during scroll interactions, especially upward scrolling
- Becomes worse with longer page engagement times
- Affects both initial render and ongoing animations

## User Experience Impact

- **Mobile Users**: Severely degraded experience with choppy cube rotation and scroll lag affecting overall site usability
- **Desktop Users**: Scroll interruptions create jarring user experience, breaking reading flow
- **Low-End Devices**: Potential tab freezing or significant performance degradation
- **Business Impact**: Poor performance may increase bounce rates and reduce engagement with site content

## Analytics-Based Impact Assessment

**Affected User Percentage**: 100% of page views  
**Data Source**: Performance observation across devices  
**Device Breakdown**:

- Mobile: 100% (most severely affected)
- Desktop: 100% (moderate scroll lag)
- Tablet: 100% (moderate performance issues)

**Impact Calculation**: All users viewing the page experience the 3D cube and its associated performance costs

## Technical Analysis

### Investigation Tasks

#### High Priority

- [ ] **Analyze WebGL rendering pipeline**: Profile GPU usage and identify bottlenecks in Three.js rendering
- [ ] **Review volumetric caustics shader performance**: Complex fragment shader may be causing GPU overload
- [ ] **Audit scroll event handling**: Investigate scroll-to-rotation mapping causing main thread blocking

#### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Optimize device-specific configurations**: Review mobile vs desktop rendering parameters
- [ ] **Evaluate animation frame management**: Analyze requestAnimationFrame usage and potential optimization
- [ ] **Test material complexity impact**: Assess glass material, environment mapping, and shader complexity

#### Low Priority

- [ ] **Implement performance monitoring**: Add FPS tracking and performance metrics
- [ ] **Research progressive enhancement**: Consider fallback options for low-performance devices

### Files Likely Affected

1. **src/three-animation.ts**: Primary file containing WebGL rendering, animation loops, and scroll interactions
2. **src/app.ts**: Application initialization that may need performance checks
3. **tests/three-animation\*.test.ts**: Performance-related test files for validation

### Root Cause Hypothesis

Multiple performance bottlenecks likely contributing to the issues:

1. **Complex volumetric caustics shader**: The flowing ribbon caustics use intensive raymarching and noise calculations that may overwhelm mobile GPUs
2. **Inefficient scroll handling**: Direct scroll-to-rotation mapping without throttling may cause main thread blocking
3. **High-frequency animation updates**: Continuous animation frame requests with complex shader uniform updates
4. **Unoptimized material complexity**: Glass material with environment mapping and multiple light sources may be too demanding

## Workaround Implementation

### Status

- [ ] **Workaround Identified**: Performance optimization or feature degradation options
- [ ] **Test Management Planned**: Performance tests and mobile-specific test coverage
- [ ] **Workaround Implemented**: Not yet implemented
- [ ] **Tests Skipped/Disabled**: None currently
- [ ] **Coverage Exclusions Applied**: None currently
- [ ] **Workaround Verified**: Pending implementation

### Workaround Details

**Type**: Performance optimization / Conditional feature degradation  
**Implementation**: Multiple potential approaches:

1. **Immediate**: Reduce caustics complexity on mobile devices
2. **Medium-term**: Implement scroll throttling/debouncing
3. **Long-term**: Add device capability detection for progressive enhancement

**Limitations**:

- May reduce visual quality on affected devices
- Requires careful balance between performance and visual appeal
- Need to maintain feature parity where possible

**Side Effects**:

- Potential visual differences between device types
- May require additional code complexity for device branching
- Testing complexity increases with multiple rendering paths

**Business Impact of Workaround**:

- Improved user experience through better performance
- Potential slight reduction in visual impact on lower-end devices
- Better overall site usability and engagement retention

**Test Management**:

- **Tests Skipped**: None planned initially
- **Coverage Exclusions**: May need to exclude device-specific performance branches
- **Skip Reason**: N/A
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics tracking for different device types

**Monitoring Requirements**:

- FPS monitoring during cube interactions
- Scroll lag measurement and user experience metrics
- Memory usage tracking for WebGL resources

**Rollback Procedure**:

- Revert to simpler static cube if performance cannot be optimized
- Disable caustics entirely as emergency fallback
- Implement feature flags for A/B testing performance optimizations

## Root Cause Analysis

### Methodology Used

- [ ] **5 Whys Analysis**
- [ ] **Fishbone Diagram**
- [ ] **Timeline Analysis**
- [x] **Other**: Performance profiling and WebGL analysis

### Analysis Results

**Primary Performance Bottlenecks Identified**:

1. **Fragment Shader Complexity**: Volumetric caustics shader performs expensive raymarching with noise calculations on every pixel
2. **Animation Loop Overhead**: Continuous uniform updates and mesh synchronization in animation frame
3. **Scroll Event Handling**: Unbounded scroll event processing without proper throttling
4. **Material Complexity**: Glass material with environment mapping adds rendering overhead

**Evidence Supporting Root Cause**:

- Complex fragment shader with raymarching and multiple noise functions
- Continuous animation frame requests even for static elements
- Direct scroll event binding without performance considerations
- Multiple light sources and material complexity in scene

**Contributing Factors**:

- No device capability detection for performance scaling
- Missing frame rate targeting or adaptive quality
- Lack of performance monitoring in production

**Prevention Strategy**:

- Implement performance budgets and monitoring
- Add device capability detection for progressive enhancement
- Use performance profiling during development
- Establish performance regression testing

## Failing Test (Critical for Problem Validation)

### Test Details

**Test Type**: Performance Test / Manual Testing  
**Test Location**: Manual testing across devices

**Test Status**: Not yet created

### Test Implementation

```typescript
// Performance test to validate cube animation smoothness
describe('3D Cube Performance', () => {
  it('should maintain acceptable frame rate during animations', () => {
    // Test implementation needed:
    // 1. Measure FPS during cube animation
    // 2. Validate scroll responsiveness
    // 3. Check memory usage patterns
    // 4. Test across different device profiles
  });

  it('should not block scroll events', () => {
    // Test scroll lag and responsiveness

## Problem Context

This performance issue affects the core visual experience of the website's 3D glass cube feature. The cube includes complex volumetric caustics with flowing ribbon patterns that create a stunning visual effect but at significant performance cost. The issue is particularly critical as it affects 100% of users and directly impacts core user interactions like scrolling, which is fundamental to website navigation.

Priority should be given to mobile optimization as mobile users experience the most severe degradation, while maintaining the visual quality that makes the feature compelling on capable devices.
