# P003: Coming Soon Button Overlapping 3D Cube

## Problem Summary

The "COMING SOON" button is incorrectly positioned on top of the 3D cube instead of being properly separated in the layout. This creates a visual overlap that interferes with both the button readability and the 3D cube presentation.

## Problem Details

**Problem ID**: P003  
**Title**: Coming Soon Button Overlapping 3D Cube  
**Priority**: 7 (High) - Visual design integrity issue affecting user experience  
**Impact**: High - Affects primary call-to-action visibility and 3D animation presentation  
**Urgency**: Medium - Not blocking functionality but degrades professional appearance  
**Category**: Layout/Design  
**Reported Date**: 2025-09-29  
**Reporter**: User feedback  
**Affected Users**: 100% - All users visiting the homepage

## Symptoms

- "COMING SOON" button appears directly over the 3D cube
- Text becomes harder to read due to visual interference with 3D animation
- Layout appears unprofessional and unintended
- Z-index stacking context issues between button and 3D canvas

## Environment Details

- **Affected Browsers**: All browsers
- **Affected Devices**: Desktop, tablet, mobile
- **Affected Sections**: Homepage hero section
- **Related Components**:
  - Coming soon button (.coming-soon-button)
  - 3D cube container (#three-container)
  - Hero section layout

## Root Cause Hypothesis

This issue likely emerged after the text flash fix (P001) which modified critical CSS display properties. The layout positioning may have been disrupted when display:none workaround was implemented, affecting the normal document flow and positioning context.

## Business Impact

- **User Experience**: Degraded visual presentation affects first impression
- **Professional Image**: Layout issues reduce perceived quality and credibility
- **Call-to-Action**: Button readability affected, potentially reducing engagement
- **Brand Consistency**: Visual inconsistency with intended design standards

## Technical Analysis

- **Root Cause Identified**: CSS layout positioning in `.hero-animation` and `.hero-section`
- **Specific Issue**: Negative bottom margin (`margin: 0 0 -100vh 0`) in `.hero-animation` pulls content up over the 3D canvas
- **Layout Pattern**: Full viewport 3D background with overlaid content, but vertical spacing insufficient to separate button from cube
- **Recent Changes**: Critical CSS display:none modifications may have affected content flow timing

## Investigation Steps

1. âœ… Review current CSS positioning for hero section elements
   - **Finding**: `.hero-animation` uses negative margin to overlay content on 3D background
   - **Finding**: `.hero-section` has `z-index: 1` but insufficient vertical spacing
2. Analyze impact of recent critical CSS changes on layout flow
3. Check z-index stacking context between button and 3D container
4. Verify responsive behavior across different screen sizes
5. Compare current layout with intended design specifications

## Technical Details

**Problematic CSS in `/src/style.css`:**

```css
.hero-animation {
  margin: 0 0 -100vh 0; /* Pulls content up over canvas */
}

.hero-section {
  z-index: 1; /* Above 3D background but creates overlap */
}
```

**HTML Structure:**

```html
<div class="hero-animation" id="hero-animation"></div>
<h1 class="hero-title">Keep Shipping Fast</h1>
<p class="hero-description">...</p>
<div class="status-indicator">
  <span class="status-text">Coming Soon</span>
</div>
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] "COMING SOON" button positioned below 3D cube with appropriate spacing
- [ ] No visual overlap between button and 3D animation
- [ ] Proper spacing maintained across all device sizes
- [ ] Button remains clearly readable and accessible
- [ ] 3D cube presentation unobstructed
- [ ] Layout maintains responsive behavior

## Related Problems

- **P001**: Text Flash Before 3D Render (resolved) - CSS changes may have caused this issue
- **Dependencies**: This problem may be a side effect of P001 workaround implementation

## Notes

- Issue discovered after implementing text flash workaround
- Requires careful balance between maintaining P001 fix and correcting layout
- Should verify that layout fix doesn't reintroduce text flash problem
