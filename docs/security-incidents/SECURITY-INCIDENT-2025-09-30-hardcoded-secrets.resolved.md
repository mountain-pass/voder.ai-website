# Security Incident Report: Hardcoded Secrets in Git History

**Date**: 2025-09-30  
**Updated**: 2025-09-30  
**Incident ID**: SECURITY-INCIDENT-2025-09-30-hardcoded-secrets  
**Status**: ðŸŸ¢ RESOLVED  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Response SLA**: Same business day (within 8 hours)  
**Assigned Investigator**: Development Team  
**Business Impact**: Potential unauthorized API usage and service access  
**Technical Impact**: Multiple third-party service credentials exposed in version control history

## Executive Summary

Hardcoded API keys and tokens were discovered in the repository's `.env` file and git commit history. Multiple third-party service credentials were exposed across several commits, creating potential for unauthorized access to OpenAI, Sentry, Microsoft Clarity, GitLeaks, Vercel, and Netlify services. Immediate containment was implemented by removing secrets from current codebase and documenting credential rotation requirements.

## Incident Classification

**Severity Justification**: HIGH - Exposed development credentials with potential for service access and API quota abuse, though no production data breach occurred.

**Severity Criteria**:

- **CRITICAL**: Active data breach, exposed production credentials, system compromise
- **HIGH**: Exposed development credentials, potential data exposure, security vulnerability in production âœ“
- **MEDIUM**: Security misconfiguration, exposed logs with sensitive data, deprecated security practices
- **LOW**: Security best practice violations, minor configuration issues

## Root Cause Analysis

### 5 Whys Analysis

**Why #1: Why did this security incident occur?**

- Because secrets were committed directly to the git repository

**Why #2: Why were secrets committed directly to the git repository?**

- Because environment variables were included in tracked files instead of being properly excluded

**Why #3: Why were environment variables included in tracked files?**

- Because the `.env` file was not properly configured in `.gitignore` from project start

**Why #4: Why was the `.env` file not properly configured in `.gitignore`?**

- Because secure development practices were not established at project initialization

**Why #5: Why were secure development practices not established at project initialization?**

- Because there was no systematic security checklist or process for new project setup

### Contributing Factors

**Technical Factors**:

- Missing `.gitignore` configuration for environment files
- Lack of automated secret scanning in development workflow

**Process Factors**:

- No security review process for initial project setup
- Missing secure development guidelines

**Human Factors**:

- Insufficient awareness of secure credential management practices
- No training on version control security best practices

**Environmental Factors**:

- Development environment setup without security considerations

## Resolution Actions

### Security Hardening

**Implemented Measures**:

- [x] Environment variables properly templated in `.env.example`
- [x] `.env` file properly ignored in version control
- [x] Documentation of security incident for future reference
- [ ] Team training on secure credential management (pending)
- [ ] Automated secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline (pending)

### System Changes
