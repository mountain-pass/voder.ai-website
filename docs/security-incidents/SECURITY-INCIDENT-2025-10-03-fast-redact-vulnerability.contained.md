# Security Incident Report: Fast-Redact Prototype Pollution Vulnerability

**Date**: 2025-10-03  
**Updated**: 2025-10-03  
**Incident ID**: SECURITY-INCIDENT-2025-10-03-fast-redact-vulnerability  
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ CONTAINED  
**Severity**: LOW  
**Response SLA**: Within 14 days for low severity  
**Assigned Investigator**: Development Team  
**Business Impact**: None - development dependency only  
**Technical Impact**: Prototype pollution vulnerability in development toolchain

## Executive Summary

A low-severity prototype pollution vulnerability (GHSA-ffrw-9mx8-89p8) was identified in the fast-redact package, which is a transitive dependency of netlify-cli used for deployment. The vulnerability affects the development toolchain only and poses no direct risk to production systems or data. Under the project's vulnerability acceptance policy, this is accepted as residual risk due to being less than 14 days since detection with no available patch.

## Incident Classification

**Severity Justification**: LOW - Development dependency vulnerability with no production impact, no available patch, and essential deployment tooling.

**Severity Criteria**:

- **CRITICAL**: Active data breach, exposed production credentials, system compromise
- **HIGH**: Exposed development credentials, potential data exposure, security vulnerability in production
- **MEDIUM**: Security misconfiguration, exposed logs with sensitive data, deprecated security practices
- **LOW**: Security best practice violations, minor configuration issues âœ“

## Root Cause Analysis

### 5 Whys Analysis

**Why #1: Why did this security incident occur?**

- fast-redact package contains a prototype pollution vulnerability

**Why #2: Why does fast-redact contain a vulnerability?**

- Package maintainer has not released a security patch for the identified issue

**Why #3: Why hasn't the maintainer released a patch?**

- The vulnerability may be newly discovered or under investigation by maintainers

**Why #4: Why are we using a package with known vulnerabilities?**

- netlify-cli is essential for deployment workflow and includes fast-redact as transitive dependency

**Why #5: Why don't we have alternative deployment methods?**

- Current architecture requires netlify-cli for automated deployment pipeline integration

### Contributing Factors

**Technical Factors**:

- Transitive dependency vulnerability (not directly controlled)
- Essential deployment tooling dependency
- No alternative deployment mechanisms implemented

**Process Factors**:

- Vulnerability acceptance policy allows low-severity issues under specific criteria
- Development-only dependency classification reduces risk profile

**Human Factors**:

- No human error identified - standard dependency vulnerability discovery

**Environmental Factors**:

- npm ecosystem vulnerability reporting and tracking system working as designed

## Resolution Actions

### Security Hardening

**Implemented Measures**:

- [x] Package.json override configuration to pin fast-redact version to latest available (3.5.0)
- [x] Documented vulnerability acceptance decision with risk assessment
- [x] Established monitoring for future security patches

### System Changes

**Configuration Updates**:

- [x] Updated package.json overrides from non-existent ^3.6.0 to available ^3.5.0
- [x] Verified npm install respects override configuration

**Code Changes**:

- No code changes required - configuration-only resolution

### Monitoring Enhancements

**New Monitoring**:

- [x] Established periodic check for fast-redact security updates
- [x] Documented security patch monitoring responsibility

**Alert Improvements**:

- [x] npm audit integrated into CI/CD pipeline for continuous monitoring

## Impact Assessment

### Business Impact

**Service Availability**: No impact - development tooling only
**Data Confidentiality**: No impact - no data exposure risk
**Regulatory Compliance**: No compliance implications identified
**Customer Trust**: No customer-facing impact

### Technical Impact

**System Security**: Minimal - development environment scope only
**Data Integrity**: No impact on data integrity
**Infrastructure**: No production infrastructure impact
**Integration Points**: Limited to deployment pipeline tooling
