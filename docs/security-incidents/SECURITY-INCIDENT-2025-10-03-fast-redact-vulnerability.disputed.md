**Date**: 2025-10-03  
**Updated**: 2025-10-23  
**Incident ID**: SECURITY-INCIDENT-2025-10-03-fast-redact-vulnerability  
**Status**: � DISPUTED  
**Severity**: DISPUTED (Originally LOW)  
**Response SLA**: Within 14 days for low severity  
**Assigned Investigator**: Development Team  
**Business Impact**: None - development dependency only  
**Technical Impact**: Prototype pollution vulnerability in development toolchain

## Executive Summary

A originally reported prototype pollution vulnerability (GHSA-ffrw-9mx8-89p8 / CVE-2025-57319) was identified in the fast-redact package, which is a transitive dependency of netlify-cli used for deployment. **DISPUTE UPDATE (2025-10-23)**: The vulnerability has been officially disputed by the fast-redact package maintainers. According to the CVE record, the supplier disputes this vulnerability because "the reporter only demonstrated access to properties by an internal utility function, and there is no means for achieving prototype pollution via the public API." This incident is now classified as DISPUTED with no actual security risk identified.

## Incident Classification

**Severity Justification**: DISPUTED - Originally classified as LOW severity, but now disputed by package maintainers with evidence that no actual vulnerability exists via public API.

**Dispute Details (CVE-2025-57319)**:

- **CVE Status**: DISPUTED (marked with "disputed" tag)
- **Maintainer Response**: "The reporter only demonstrated access to properties by an internal utility function, and there is no means for achieving prototype pollution via the public API"
- **Risk Assessment**: No actual security vulnerability confirmed
- **Current Classification**: False positive / Disputed vulnerability report

## Root Cause Analysis

### 5 Whys Analysis

**Why #1: Why did this security incident occur?**

- A security researcher reported a prototype pollution vulnerability in fast-redact package

**Why #2: Why was the vulnerability initially accepted as valid?**

- Standard vulnerability scanning tools flagged the issue without verification of dispute status

**Why #3: Why was the vulnerability later disputed?**

- Package maintainers investigated and determined that no actual vulnerability exists via public API

**Why #4: Why was there a delay in identifying the dispute?**

- CVE dispute information was not automatically integrated into vulnerability scanning workflow

**Why #5: Why didn't initial assessment catch the dispute?**

- Assessment process relied on npm audit output without checking CVE dispute status

**Contributing Factors**:

**Technical Factors**:

- Vulnerability scanning tools reported unverified security issue
- CVE dispute status not automatically integrated into scanning workflow
- False positive in security vulnerability database

**Process Factors**:

- Security assessment process did not include CVE dispute verification
- Automated tooling created initial false alarm without human verification
- Lack of integration between npm audit and CVE dispute tracking

**Human Factors**:

- Initial assessment relied solely on automated scanning output
- CVE dispute research not part of standard vulnerability assessment process

**Environmental Factors**:

- CVE ecosystem includes disputed entries that require manual verification
- npm audit does not filter disputed vulnerabilities automatically
