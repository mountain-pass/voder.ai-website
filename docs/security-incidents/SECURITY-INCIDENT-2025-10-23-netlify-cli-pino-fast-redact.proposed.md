# Security Incident Report: netlify-cli pino/fast-redact Vulnerabilities

**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Updated**: 2025-10-23  
**Incident ID**: SECURITY-INCIDENT-2025-10-23-netlify-cli-pino-fast-redact  
**Status**: 🟡 INVESTIGATING  
**Severity**: LOW  
**Response SLA**: 14 days (LOW severity - standard monitoring)  
**Assigned Investigator**: Development Team  
**Business Impact**: None - Development dependency only  
**Technical Impact**: Indirect dependencies in development tooling

## Executive Summary

Two LOW severity vulnerabilities were detected in indirect dependencies of netlify-cli during routine dependency audit on October 23, 2025. The vulnerabilities affect fast-redact (prototype pollution) and its dependent package pino, both of which are indirect dependencies through netlify-cli → @netlify/build → pino → fast-redact. A fix is available via updating netlify-cli from 18.2.2 to 23.9.3, however this update was released only 1 day ago (Oct 22, 2025) and represents a MAJOR version jump (5 major versions). Due to the LOW severity, indirect nature, and extremely fresh release, we are documenting this as an accepted risk with a scheduled update on October 29, 2025 when the package reaches 7 days maturity per Smart Version Selection Algorithm.

## Incident Classification

**Severity Justification**: LOW severity assigned due to:

- Indirect development dependency only (not in production code)
- No direct exploitation vectors in our codebase
- Prototype pollution vulnerability requires specific attack scenarios
- No evidence of active exploitation
- Fix requires MAJOR version update with potential breaking changes

**Severity Criteria Applied**: Security best practice violation, minor security issue in development tooling

## Incident Details

### Initial Detection

- **Detection Method**: Automated npm audit during Phase 1 dependency assessment
- **Detection Time**: 2025-10-23 10:30 UTC
- **Detection Source**: npm audit command
- **Initial Symptoms**: npm audit reported 2 LOW severity vulnerabilities

### Scope Assessment

**Affected Systems**:

- Development environment only (netlify-cli)
- No production code affected
- No customer-facing systems impacted

**Compromised Data Types**:

- None - vulnerabilities are in development tooling

**Exposure Timeline**:

- **First Exposure**: Unknown (requires git history analysis of package-lock.json)
- **Detection**: 2025-10-23 10:30 UTC
- **Exposure Duration**: Unknown, requires investigation
- **Production Exposure**: None (development dependency only)

**Affected Credentials**:

- None

### Vulnerability Details

**CVE-1: fast-redact Prototype Pollution**

- **Package**: fast-redact <=3.5.0
- **CVE**: GHSA-ffrw-9mx8-89p8
- **CWE**: CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes)
- **Severity**: LOW

- **Severity**: LOW
- **Description**: Vulnerability via dependency on affected fast-redact versions
- **Dependency Path**: netlify-cli → @netlify/build → pino

### Attack Vectors

**Potential Attack Vectors**:

- Prototype pollution attacks during netlify-cli execution
- Requires attacker to control input to fast-redact redaction patterns
- Limited to development environment context
- No direct production code exposure

**Risk Assessment**:

- **Likelihood**: Very Low (development tool only, requires specific attack scenario)
- **Impact**: Low (limited to development environment)
- **Overall Risk**: LOW (accepted for short-term deferral)

| 10:50 | INVESTIGATING | Documented as accepted risk with scheduled update Oct 29, 2025        | Development Team |

## Immediate Response Actions

### Containment Measures

**Actions Taken**:

- [x] Verified vulnerabilities are development dependencies only
- [x] Confirmed no production code exposure
- [x] Assessed update options using Smart Version Selection Algorithm
- [x] Documented accepted risk and update timeline

**Threat Status**: Contained - No active threat to production systems

### Update Decision

**Available Update**: netlify-cli 18.2.2 → 23.9.3

- **Fixes Vulnerabilities**: YES
- **Release Date**: October 22, 2025 (1 day old)
- **Version Jump**: MAJOR (5 major versions: 18 → 23)
- **Breaking Changes**: Likely (major version jump)
- **Algorithm Decision**: DEFER until maturity (Oct 29, 2025)

**Rationale for Deferral**:

1. LOW severity vulnerabilities (no immediate threat)
2. Development dependency only (no production impact)
3. Update is extremely fresh (< 2 days old, high instability risk)
4. MAJOR version jump (high breaking change risk)
5. Smart Version Selection Algorithm recommends 7-day maturity window
6. Scheduled update date provides 7-day maturity: Oct 29, 2025

## Root Cause Analysis

### 5 Whys Analysis

**Why #1: Why did this security incident occur?**

- Vulnerabilities exist in fast-redact and pino packages

**Why #2: Why are we using packages with vulnerabilities?**

- They are indirect dependencies of netlify-cli, not directly chosen

**Why #3: Why haven't these been updated automatically?**

- Updates require netlify-cli major version update which was just released

**Why #4: Why was the netlify-cli update just released?**

- Package maintainer release schedule independent of our control

**Why #5: Why do we defer updates of fresh packages?**

- Smart Version Selection Algorithm prioritizes stability over immediacy to avoid introducing breaking changes from untested releases

### Contributing Factors

**Technical Factors**:

- Indirect dependency makes direct updates impossible
- MAJOR version updates carry breaking change risk
- Package was released very recently (instability risk)

**Process Factors**:

- Smart Version Selection Algorithm correctly identified freshness risk
- Security vs. stability trade-off appropriately balanced for LOW severity

**Human Factors**:

- None - automated detection and algorithm-based decision making

**Environmental Factors**:

- Unusually fresh package releases across ecosystem (all 12 updates < 7 days)

**Smart Version Selection Analysis**:

- All 12 outdated packages analyzed
- Release dates verified via npm registry
- Maturity timeline calculated (Oct 25-30)
- netlify-cli 23.9.3 identified as FRESH + MAJOR (highest risk category)

### Analysis Results

**Dependency Chain**:

```
netlify-cli@18.2.2
  └─ @netlify/build
      └─ pino (5.0.0-rc.1 - 9.11.0)
          └─ fast-redact (<=3.5.0) ⚠️ VULNERABLE
```

**Update Analysis**:

- Fix available: netlify-cli@23.9.3 (uses pino with patched fast-redact)
- Release date: 2025-10-22T20:26:02.300Z
