Summary of work completed so far

- Repository & developer tooling
  - Initialized the Git repo and added Vitest, ESLint flat-config, Prettier, coverage reporting, package.json scripts, peerDependencies, and conditional exports.

- TypeScript migration & cleanup
  - Migrated the codebase to strict-mode TypeScript.
  - Removed 107 obsolete files and legacy docs.
  - Replaced local tsconfig.json with shared @voder/dev-config extends-based configs and added multiple tsconfig variants.
  - Committed a missing TypeScript build preset (packages/dev-config/typescript/build.json).

- Testing, build & packaging
  - Implemented ~33 Vitest test suites with 100% coverage.
  - Built ESM and CJS bundles with type declarations and asset copying.
  - Established a Prebuild → Build → Verify pipeline.
  - Refactored vitest.config.ts to use createVitestNodeConfig (39 tests passed locally after refactor).

- CI, governance & security
  - Added a GitHub Actions “verify” workflow (lint, format, type-check, build, tests).
  - Added import-time checks and an audit:ci step per ADR-0007.
  - Added SECURITY.md, audited dependencies to zero vulnerabilities, regenerated the lockfile, and upgraded esbuild.

- Documentation & API work
  - Renamed the package to @voder/dev-config.
  - Expanded README (changelog, migration guide, full API), added CONTRIBUTING.md, published a docs site, and enforced Markdownlint.
  - Simplified ESLint snippets, clarified API.md, and added .eslintignore for output/support folders.

- Major refactorings & cleanup
  - Removed obsolete Vite scripts, unified test helpers, cleared ESLint warnings, tightened parserOptions, fixed undefined-variable checks, and updated devDependencies and scripts.

- Utility additions & ESLint patches
  - Added validateRuntime.ts and jsonLoader.ts with tests.
  - Patched ESLint flat-config for JSON modules and added jiti@^2.5.1 as an ESLint TypeScript loader peer dependency.
  - Patched eslint/index.ts to include src/tests in the `complete` export.

- Config and tsconfig updates
  - Modified prettier.config.ts to re-export a shared config.
  - Updated tsconfig.build.json to extend the shared preset and set only outDir.
  - Replaced the project-root tsconfig.build.json with an extends-based config (outDir, rootDir, explicit include list).

- TypeScript build resolution & fixes
  - Fixed jsonLoader resolution and moved eslint.config.ts into src/.
  - Resolved TS2209 and many TS6059 errors by replacing the project-root tsconfig.build.json and relocating eslint.config.ts.
  - After fixes, npm run verify completed successfully locally (linting, tests, formatting passed).

- ADR-0013 (duplicate docs cleanup)
  - Created docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md (ADR-0013) on 2025-08-28, marked accepted, and iteratively edited it to record scope, constraints, duplicate classifications, canonical/non-canonical paths, and findings.

- Duplicate-detection runs and artifacts
  - Ran shell pipelines (find | sha1sum | sort | awk) to produce duplicate reports and artifacts in /tmp: all-shas.txt, duplicate-report.txt, duplicate-summary.txt, duplicate-tracking-status.txt; fixed an initial shell uniq error during runs.
  - Reported exact-file duplicates (examples: coverage/lcov-report duplicates; duplicate .d.ts files under typescript/dist/ and variants).
  - Confirmed duplicate files reported were not tracked by git (duplicate-tracking-status.txt was empty).

- Git verification and tracked-file checks
  - Ran git ls-files checks for candidate duplicate paths; many candidate paths were not tracked.
  - git rm --cached checks for coverage files confirmed those files were not tracked.

- ADR updates and duplicate-group handling
  - Appended a candidate ADR entry for duplicate SHA 0005f29 (./node_modules/postcss/lib/list.d.ts).
  - Generated /tmp/0005f29-files.txt and /tmp/0005f29-tracking-status.txt via Node and shell scripts; checks reported files as not tracked where applicable.
  - Created and executed Node and shell scripts to examine duplicates and tracking status; made local commits during these runs and pushed to origin/main.

- ADR-0013 remediation run for SHA 0005f29
  - Executed a non-interactive remediation script that saved in-flight doc edits, appended a classification entry to ADR-0013, verified tracking-status files, recorded NO-ACTION (no tracked non-canonical files), and exited before any git remove or build/verify steps.
  - Commits produced during remediation:
    - 3c88356 chore(docs): save in-flight doc edits before ADR-0013 remediation
    - ac2d377 docs(adr-0013): classify duplicate group 0005f29 as generated/build-artifact
    - cd9206d docs(adr-0013): record no-action for 0005f29 (no tracked files)
  - Artifacts created (examples): /tmp/adr-0013-0005f29-note.txt and /tmp/0005f29-tracking-status.txt.
  - Repository state after remediation: branch main at cd9206d; no tracked files were removed, only documentation/ADR commits were added.

- Housekeeping, lockfile generation & successful verification
  - Updated .gitignore to add tmp/ and other ignores.
  - Cleaned node_modules, package-lock.json, dist, coverage; ran npm ci (initially failed due to missing lockfile).
  - Generated a top-level package-lock.json with npm install --package-lock-only (name "@voder/dev-config", version "1.0.0", lockfileVersion 3).
  - After creating the lockfile, ran rm -rf node_modules dist coverage && npm ci --no-audit --no-fund && npm run verify — the sequence completed successfully and logs were inspected (/tmp/verify-npm-ci.log and related artifacts).

- Most recent duplicate-detection and ADR note
  - Re-ran the duplicate-detection pipeline, produced /tmp artifacts, confirmed duplicates existed but none were tracked by git.
  - Appended a timestamped note to docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md recording that no tracked non-canonical duplicates were found and referenced /tmp/duplicate-report.txt; committed the change.

- Final commit and repo status (at that time)
  - Staged and committed docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md and package-lock.json.
  - Commit "chore: finalize ADR-0013 update and package-lock.json" (hash 49b0594): 2 files changed, 558 insertions(+), 1171 deletions(-).
  - At that time branch main was ahead of origin/main by 5 commits.

- Most recent automated actions, pushes & logs
  - Removed node_modules, dist, coverage; ran npm ci --no-audit --no-fund and npm run verify; runs completed successfully and logs were preserved under /tmp.
  - Performed git push origin HEAD:main and related pushes; pushes completed successfully and were logged to /tmp/git-push.log.

- Scripts added & runs
  - Added scripts/duplicate-detect.sh (report-only POSIX duplicate-detection script), made it executable, committed ("chore: add duplicate-detect.sh (report-only)"), and executed it; run and logs recorded under /tmp/duplicate-detect-run.log.

- Latest pushes and branch creation
  - Executed git push origin main; local pending commit was pushed to origin/main and output saved to /tmp/git-push-now.log.
  - Created and switched to a new branch cleanup/dup-docs-and-utils.

- Most recent edit (docs wording alignment)
  - Replaced occurrences of provider: 'v8' with provider: 'istanbul' and aligned wording in docs/libraries/usage/vitest.md and README.md; committed the change ("docs: align Vitest coverage provider wording with ADR-0009 (Istanbul)").
  - Updated docs/libraries/usage/vitest.md to document createVitestNodeConfig usage, coverage thresholds, setupFiles, and that the factory config uses provider: 'istanbul'.
  - Updated README.md to expand package description, usage examples, API reference snippets, peer dependency notes, troubleshooting, security, and contributing instructions.
