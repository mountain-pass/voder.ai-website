Summary — history of work completed so far

- Repository & developer tooling
  - Initialized Git repo and added developer tooling (Vitest, ESLint flat-config, Prettier, coverage reporting, npm scripts, peerDependencies, conditional exports).
  - Added GitHub Actions "verify" workflow (lint, format, type-check, build, tests), import-time checks, and audit:ci per ADR-0007.
  - Added SECURITY.md, audited dependencies to zero vulnerabilities, regenerated the lockfile, and upgraded esbuild.

- Package, docs & governance
  - Renamed package to @voder/dev-config; expanded README (changelog, migration guide, API), added CONTRIBUTING.md and other docs, published docs, and enforced markdownlint.
  - Created ADR-0013 (duplicate-doc cleanup) with scope, constraints, classifications, and timestamped findings.

- TypeScript migration & build pipeline
  - Migrated to strict-mode TypeScript, removed ~107 obsolete files, and adopted shared tsconfig and build presets.
  - Implemented a Prebuild → Build → Verify pipeline producing ESM and CJS bundles with .d.ts files and asset copying.
  - Resolved TypeScript errors; npm run build and npm run verify completed; dist/ contains compiled JS and declarations matching exports.

- Testing & coverage
  - Added ~33 Vitest suites (≈39 tests after refactor), achieving 100% coverage.
  - Refactored vitest.config.ts to use createVitestNodeConfig and switched coverage provider to @vitest/coverage-istanbul per ADR-0009.
  - Ran targeted tests (example: dependency-alignment.test.ts — passed).

- Refactors, utilities & patches
  - Removed obsolete Vite scripts, unified test helpers, cleared ESLint warnings, and tightened parserOptions.
  - Added validateRuntime.ts and jsonLoader.ts with tests.
  - Patched ESLint flat-config for JSON modules; added jiti@^2.5.1 as an ESLint type-loader peerDependency; adjusted eslint exports to include src/tests.
  - Extracted ensureDir into src/utils/fs.ts; rewrote scripts/copy-assets.ts as cross-platform, testable implementation with CLI guard.
  - Added safeSpawn helper with unit tests; updated prettier/build tsconfigs to extend shared presets.

- Duplicate-detection, ADR handling & scripts
  - Ran multiple duplicate-detection pipelines, producing artifacts (all-shas.txt, duplicate-report.txt, duplicate-summary.txt, per-SHA artifacts, tracking status).
  - Reported exact-file duplicates for some untracked/generated paths and many candidate paths untracked by git.
  - Created Node and shell scripts to examine duplicates and tracking status; produced per-SHA artifacts and appended candidate ADR entries.
  - Performed a non-interactive ADR-0013 remediation run for SHA 0005f29, preserved in-flight doc edits, appended a NO-ACTION classification, and saved remediation commits/artifacts under /tmp.
  - Added scripts/duplicate-detect.sh (POSIX report-only), re-ran detection, and committed docs/decisions/0013-consolidation-todo-20250828T183725Z.md from output.
  - Multiple detection runs (Node and shell variants) completed successfully and reported "No tracked duplicate hashes detected" for tracked files.

- Housekeeping, lockfile & verification
  - Updated .gitignore; cleaned node_modules/dist/coverage; regenerated top-level package-lock.json (name "@voder/dev-config", version "1.0.0", lockfileVersion 3).
  - Ran npm ci --no-audit --no-fund and npm run verify after recreating the lockfile; verification cycles completed successfully.
  - Repeated npm audit runs and saved machine-readable outputs; reports consistently showed 0 vulnerabilities.
  - Installed husky@^8.0.0 and ran npx husky install.

- Commits, branches & repository state
  - Committed ADR updates and package-lock.json, performed a large cleanup commit on branch cleanup/dup-docs-and-utils, and created subsequent branches for fixes and consolidation.
  - Stashed tracked modifications prior to path-safety work; later the working tree showed no modified tracked files, only untracked files.
  - Set local git user to "Voder Bot" <voder@example.com>.
  - Created branch cleanup/security-hardening-20250828T183725Z and committed multiple security-hardening and scripting changes.
  - Most recent git commit added docs/decisions/0013-duplicate-classification-20250828T000000Z.md.
  - Final staged commit message: "chore(dup-detect): record canonical duplicate-detect choice (POSIX script); removed untracked JS variants; refs ADR-0013" (commit 211740eb — 18 files changed, 455 insertions, 355 deletions).

- Documentation updates & checks
  - Aligned docs wording; documented coverage provider as "istanbul", createVitestNodeConfig usage, coverage thresholds, setupFiles and coverage provider.
  - Generated /tmp/all-md-shas.txt (34 tracked markdown files) and ran checks reporting "No tracked user-facing duplicate hashes detected".
  - Created and committed docs/CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md and other ADR/docs artifacts.

- Recent checks, builds & outputs
  - Ran tracked-file duplicate checks producing ./tmp/code-shas.txt and ./tmp/code-duplicate-hashes.txt; reported "No tracked code-file duplicates detected".
  - Captured an earlier npm run verify lint-phase failure caused by importing @voder/dev-config/eslint before compiled dist artifacts existed; fixed build ordering and metadata, then executed npm run verify successfully.
  - Processed duplicate-detect logs into /tmp/duplicate-report-now.log and created /tmp/duplicate-classification.json summarizing no tracked duplicates (some runs were created while repo had modified/untracked files).

- Duplicate-detection artifacts & logs
  - Saved many intermediate artifacts and logs under /tmp (duplicate reports, audit outputs, build logs, verification logs, per-SHA artifacts, duplicate-classification.json, npm-audit.json, etc.).
  - Executed npm audit --json and saved the report to /tmp/npm-audit.json (auditReportVersion: 2; vulnerabilities: total=0).

- File operations & recent activity
  - Read, modified and committed numerous files (package.json, eslint/index.ts, tsconfig files, src/testing/index.ts, scripts/copy-assets.ts, etc.).
  - Rewrote and staged scripts/copy-assets.ts to be cross-platform and testable; added a CLI guard.
  - Removed two untracked legacy duplicate-detect files: scripts/duplicate-detect.js and scripts/duplicate-detect.cjs.

- Last executed commands & most recent action
  - Ran git ls-files, inspected .gitignore, listed scripts directory, read scripts/duplicate-detect.sh, and ran git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all.
  - Ensured canonical ADR file docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md (no overwrite) and staged/committed related changes.
  - Most recently executed: npm run generate:md-config (output logged to /tmp/generate-md-config.log). The action completed successfully.

All completed runs finished successfully; audit outputs consistently showed zero vulnerabilities.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

Used tool: read_file with input: {"filePath":"package.json"}
Used tool: run_command with input: {"command":"bash","parameters":["-lc","npm run lint:md:fix 2>&1 | tee /tmp/lint-md-fix.log"]}

Done — I ran the FIRST step from the plan: the markdown autofix.

What I ran
- npm run lint:md:fix 2>&1 | tee /tmp/lint-md-fix.log

Where to find the console-first log
- /tmp/lint-md-fix.log

Summary of results
- Command completed successfully (markdownlint-cli2 v0.18.1).
- Files linted: 20 files (CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md, SECURITY.md, docs/decisions/*, etc.).
- Auto-fixes were applied where possible.
- Remaining issues: 3 markdownlint errors (all in docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md):

  1) docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md:78:43 MD033/no-inline-html — Inline HTML [Element: relevant]
  2) docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md:176 MD025/single-title/single-h1 — Multiple top-level headings in the same document
  3) docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md:183 MD025/single-title/single-h1 — Multiple top-level headings in the same document

Git status (unstaged changes)

Notes / next recommended action (per plan)
- The lint autofix handled many issues but left some that require manual edits (inline HTML and duplicate top-level headings). The plan's next step is to run formatting, stage and commit the auto-fixes:
  - npm run format 2>&1 | tee /tmp/format-after-docs.log || true
  - git add -A
  - git commit -m "chore(docs): apply markdown & format auto-fixes after canonicalization; refs ADR-0013" 2>&1 | tee /tmp/git-commit-docs-autofix.log || true

If you want, I can proceed with those three commands now (format → stage → commit). Otherwise I will wait for your confirmation before continuing.

<scratchpad>
- The lint:md:fix step was the correct "FIRST action" and completed as expected.
- MD033 (inline HTML) and MD025 (multiple H1s) cannot be safely auto-fixed; they need manual editing of docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md. We should avoid touching prompts/, prompt-assets/, or .voder/ per the plan — but the .voder files are metadata changed by the tool and are expected to be committed as part of the autofix commit in the plan.
- Proceeding with format + commit is low-risk and is the next prescribed step. After that we will run full verify and iterate on any failures.
</scratchpad>
