Summary of work completed so far

- Repository & developer tooling
  - Initialized Git repository and added developer tooling: Vitest, ESLint flat-config, Prettier, coverage reporting, npm scripts, peerDependencies, and conditional exports.
  - Added a GitHub Actions "verify" workflow (lint, format, type-check, build, tests), import-time checks, and audit:ci per ADR-0007.
  - Added SECURITY.md, audited dependencies to zero vulnerabilities, regenerated the lockfile, and upgraded esbuild.

- Package, docs & governance
  - Renamed package to @voder/dev-config; expanded README (changelog, migration guide, API), added CONTRIBUTING.md and other docs, published docs, and enforced markdownlint.
  - Created ADR-0013 (duplicate-doc cleanup) documenting scope, constraints, classifications, and timestamped findings.

- TypeScript migration & build pipeline
  - Migrated to strict-mode TypeScript, removed ~107 obsolete files, adopted shared tsconfig and build presets.
  - Implemented Prebuild → Build → Verify pipeline producing ESM and CJS bundles with .d.ts files and asset copying.
  - Resolved TypeScript errors; npm run build and npm run verify completed; dist/ contains compiled JS and declarations matching exports.

- Testing & coverage
  - Added ~33 Vitest suites (≈39 tests after refactor) achieving 100% coverage.
  - Refactored vitest.config.ts to use createVitestNodeConfig and switched coverage provider to @vitest/coverage-istanbul per ADR-0009.
  - Ran targeted tests (example: dependency-alignment.test.ts — passed).

- Refactors, utilities & patches
  - Removed obsolete Vite scripts, unified test helpers, cleared ESLint warnings, tightened parserOptions.
  - Added validateRuntime.ts and jsonLoader.ts with tests.
  - Patched ESLint flat-config for JSON modules; added jiti@^2.5.1 as an ESLint type-loader peerDependency; adjusted eslint exports to include src/tests.
  - Extracted ensureDir into src/utils/fs.ts; rewrote scripts/copy-assets.ts as a cross-platform, testable implementation with CLI guard.
  - Added safeSpawn helper with unit tests; updated prettier/build tsconfigs to extend shared presets.

- Duplicate-detection, ADR handling & scripts
  - Ran multiple duplicate-detection pipelines (Node and POSIX shell variants), producing artifacts: all-shas.txt, duplicate-report.txt, duplicate-summary.txt, per-SHA artifacts, and tracking status outputs.
  - Reported exact-file duplicates for some untracked/generated paths and many candidate paths untracked by git; produced per-SHA artifacts and appended candidate ADR entries.
  - Performed a non-interactive ADR-0013 remediation run for SHA 0005f29 (preserved in-flight doc edits), appended a NO-ACTION classification, and saved remediation commits/artifacts under /tmp.
  - Created scripts to examine duplicates and tracking status (including scripts/duplicate-detect.sh); committed docs/decisions/0013-consolidation-todo-*.md from output.
  - Multiple detection runs reported "No tracked duplicate hashes detected" for tracked files.

- Housekeeping, lockfile & verification
  - Updated .gitignore; cleaned node_modules/dist/coverage; regenerated top-level package-lock.json (name "@voder/dev-config", version "1.0.0", lockfileVersion 3).
  - Ran npm ci --no-audit --no-fund and npm run verify after recreating the lockfile; verification cycles completed successfully.
  - Repeated npm audit runs and saved machine-readable outputs; reports consistently showed 0 vulnerabilities.
  - Installed husky@^8.0.0 and ran npx husky install.

- Commits, branches & repository state
  - Committed ADR updates and package-lock.json; performed a large cleanup commit on branch cleanup/dup-docs-and-utils and created subsequent branches for fixes and consolidation.
  - Stashed tracked modifications prior to path-safety work; later working tree showed no modified tracked files, only untracked files.
  - Set local git user to "Voder Bot" <voder@example.com>.
  - Created branch cleanup/security-hardening-20250828T183725Z and committed multiple security-hardening and scripting changes.
  - Most recent git commit before the final action added docs/decisions/0013-duplicate-classification-20250828T000000Z.md.
  - A final staged commit (211740eb) recorded canonical duplicate-detect choice (POSIX script) and removal of untracked JS variants (18 files changed, 455 insertions, 355 deletions).

- Documentation updates & checks
  - Aligned docs wording; documented coverage provider as "istanbul", createVitestNodeConfig usage, coverage thresholds, setupFiles and coverage provider.
  - Generated /tmp/all-md-shas.txt (34 tracked markdown files) and ran checks reporting "No tracked user-facing duplicate hashes detected".
  - Created and committed docs/CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md and other ADR/docs artifacts.

- Recent checks, builds & fixes
  - Ran tracked-file duplicate checks producing ./tmp/code-shas.txt and ./tmp/code-duplicate-hashes.txt; reported "No tracked code-file duplicates detected".
  - Captured and fixed an npm run verify lint-phase failure caused by importing @voder/dev-config/eslint before compiled dist artifacts existed; fixed build ordering and metadata, then executed npm run verify successfully.
  - Processed duplicate-detect logs into /tmp/duplicate-report-now.log and created /tmp/duplicate-classification.json summarizing no tracked duplicates (some runs created while repo had modified/untracked files).

- Duplicate-detection artifacts & logs
  - Saved many intermediate artifacts and logs under /tmp (duplicate reports, audit outputs, build logs, verification logs, per-SHA artifacts, duplicate-classification.json, npm-audit.json, etc.).
  - Executed npm audit --json and saved the report to /tmp/npm-audit.json (auditReportVersion: 2; vulnerabilities: total=0).

- File operations & recent activity
  - Read, modified and committed numerous files (package.json, eslint/index.ts, tsconfig files, src/testing/index.ts, scripts/copy-assets.ts, etc.).
  - Rewrote and staged scripts/copy-assets.ts to be cross-platform and testable; added a CLI guard.
  - Removed two untracked legacy duplicate-detect files: scripts/duplicate-detect.js and scripts/duplicate-detect.cjs.

- Commands executed & generated outputs
  - Ran git ls-files, inspected .gitignore, listed scripts directory, read scripts/duplicate-detect.sh, and ran git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all.
  - Ensured canonical ADR file docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md (no overwrite) and staged/committed related changes.
  - Executed npm run generate:md-config (output logged to /tmp/generate-md-config.log) — completed successfully.

- Markdown autofix & most recent action
  - Ran npm run lint:md:fix (markdownlint-cli2 v0.18.1); auto-fixes applied to 20 markdown files; three remaining markdownlint issues in docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md (MD033, two MD025).
  - Committed the markdown autofix changes on branch cleanup/security-hardening-20250828T183725Z:
    - Commit created: 7d0a4c8
    - 8 files changed, 311 insertions(+), 228 deletions(-)
  - Capture of the git commit output saved at /tmp/git-commit-docs-autofix.log.

All completed runs finished successfully; audit outputs consistently showed zero vulnerabilities.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

Done — I ran the NOW step (format auto‑fix) from the plan.

What I ran
- Command: npm run format 2>&1 | tee /tmp/format-after-docs.log || true
- Result: Prettier ran and the output was captured to /tmp/format-after-docs.log.
- Note: Node printed an experimental warning about --experimental-strip-types (expected).

- M packages/dev-config/scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts

Next step in the plan (ready to run)
- Stage & commit formatting auto-fixes:
  git add -A
  git commit -m "chore(docs): apply formatting auto-fixes after markdown fixes; refs ADR-0013"
  (the plan captures output to /tmp/git-commit-docs-format.log)

I will not commit these changes unless you want me to proceed. Confirm if you'd like me to run the staging + commit step now (I'll run it non-interactively and capture logs to /tmp as per the plan).
