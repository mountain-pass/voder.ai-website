Summary of work completed so far

- Repository & developer tooling
  - Initialized Git repo and added developer tooling (Vitest, ESLint flat-config, Prettier, coverage reporting, npm scripts, peerDependencies, conditional exports).
  - Added GitHub Actions "verify" workflow (lint, format, type-check, build, tests), import-time checks, and audit:ci per ADR-0007.
  - Added SECURITY.md, audited dependencies to zero vulnerabilities, regenerated lockfile, and upgraded esbuild.

- Package, docs & governance
  - Renamed package to @voder/dev-config; expanded README (changelog, migration guide, API), added CONTRIBUTING.md and other docs, published docs, and enforced markdownlint.
  - Created ADR-0013 (duplicate-doc cleanup) with scope, constraints, classifications and timestamped findings.

- TypeScript migration & build pipeline
  - Migrated to strict-mode TypeScript, removed ~107 obsolete files, adopted shared tsconfig and build presets.
  - Implemented Prebuild → Build → Verify pipeline producing ESM and CJS bundles with type declarations and asset copying.
  - Resolved TypeScript errors; npm run verify and npm run build completed successfully; dist/ contains compiled JS and .d.ts files matching package.json exports.

- Testing & coverage
  - Added ~33 Vitest suites (~39 tests after refactor) and achieved 100% coverage.
  - Refactored vitest.config.ts to use createVitestNodeConfig and switched coverage provider to @vitest/coverage-istanbul per ADR-0009.
  - Ran targeted tests (example: dependency-alignment.test.ts — passed).

- Refactors, utilities & patches
  - Removed obsolete Vite scripts, unified test helpers, cleared ESLint warnings, tightened parserOptions.
  - Added validateRuntime.ts and jsonLoader.ts with tests.
  - Patched ESLint flat-config for JSON modules, added jiti@^2.5.1 as ESLint type-loader peerDependency, adjusted eslint exports to include src/tests.
  - Extracted ensureDir into src/utils/fs.ts; rewrote scripts/copy-assets.ts as a cross-platform, testable asset-copy implementation with a CLI guard.
  - Added safeSpawn helper with unit tests and updated prettier/build tsconfigs to extend shared presets.

- Duplicate-detection, ADR handling & scripts
  - Ran multiple duplicate-detection pipelines and produced many artifacts (all-shas.txt, duplicate-report.txt, duplicate-summary.txt, per-SHA artifacts, tracking status).
  - Reported exact-file duplicates for some untracked/generated paths (examples: coverage/lcov-report duplicates; duplicate .d.ts under typescript/dist/) and many candidate paths untracked by git.
  - Created Node and shell scripts to examine duplicates and tracking status; produced per-SHA artifacts and appended candidate ADR entries.
  - Performed a non-interactive ADR-0013 remediation run for SHA 0005f29 that preserved in-flight doc edits, appended a NO-ACTION classification to ADR-0013, and saved remediation commits/artifacts under /tmp.
  - Added scripts/duplicate-detect.sh (POSIX report-only) and re-ran detection; tracked-only pipelines reported "No tracked duplicate hashes detected".
  - Generated and committed docs/decisions/0013-consolidation-todo-20250828T183725Z.md from duplicate-detect output.

- Housekeeping, lockfile & verification
  - Updated .gitignore; cleaned node_modules/dist/coverage; regenerated top-level package-lock.json (name "@voder/dev-config", version "1.0.0", lockfileVersion 3).
  - Ran npm ci --no-audit --no-fund and npm run verify after recreating the lockfile; verification cycles completed successfully.
  - Repeated npm audit runs and saved machine-readable outputs; all reports consistently showed 0 vulnerabilities.
  - Installed husky@^8.0.0 and ran npx husky install.

- Commits, branches & repository state
  - Committed ADR updates and package-lock.json, performed a large cleanup commit on branch cleanup/dup-docs-and-utils, and created subsequent branches for fixes and consolidation.
  - Stashed tracked modifications prior to path-safety work; later working tree showed no modified tracked files, only untracked files.
  - Set local git user to "Voder Bot" <voder@example.com>.
  - Created branch cleanup/security-hardening-20250828T183725Z and committed multiple security-hardening and scripting changes.
  - Most recent git commit added docs/decisions/0013-duplicate-classification-20250828T000000Z.md.

- Documentation updates & checks
  - Aligned docs wording and documented the coverage provider as "istanbul"; documented createVitestNodeConfig usage, coverage thresholds, setupFiles and coverage provider.
  - Generated /tmp/all-md-shas.txt (34 tracked markdown files) and ran checks reporting "No tracked user-facing duplicate hashes detected".
  - Created and committed docs/CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md.

- Recent checks, builds & outputs
  - Ran tracked-file duplicate checks producing ./tmp/code-shas.txt and ./tmp/code-duplicate-hashes.txt; reported "No tracked code-file duplicates detected".
  - Captured an earlier npm run verify lint-phase failure related to importing @voder/dev-config/eslint before compiled dist artifacts existed; saved console output to /tmp.
  - Fixed build ordering and metadata, then executed npm run verify successfully.

- Recent duplicate-detection artifacts & logs
  - Processed duplicate-detect logs into /tmp/duplicate-report-now.log showing "No tracked duplicate hashes detected".
  - Created /tmp/duplicate-classification.json summarizing no tracked duplicates (created while repository had other modified/untracked files).
  - Executed ./scripts/duplicate-detect.sh and scripts/duplicate-detect.js/.cjs; runs completed successfully and reported "No tracked duplicate hashes detected".

- Final recorded actions & artifacts
  - Committed package.json + package-lock.json and staged/committed scripts/duplicate-detect.sh.
  - Saved many intermediate artifacts and logs under /tmp (duplicate reports, audit outputs, build logs, verification logs, per-SHA artifacts, duplicate-classification.json, npm-audit.json, etc.).
  - Executed npm audit --json and saved the report to /tmp/npm-audit.json (auditReportVersion: 2; vulnerabilities: total=0).

- File operations & recent activity
  - Read, modified and committed numerous files (package.json, eslint/index.ts, tsconfig files, src/testing/index.ts, scripts/copy-assets.ts, etc.).
  - Rewrote and staged scripts/copy-assets.ts to be cross-platform and testable; added CLI guard.
  - Most recent recorded action: generated and committed docs/decisions/0013-consolidation-todo-20250828T183725Z.md (commit: "docs(adr): record consolidation TODO list from duplicate detection; refs ADR-0013").

- Last executed commands (record)
  - Ran git ls-files for duplicate-detect scripts, inspected .gitignore, listed scripts directory, read scripts/duplicate-detect.sh, and ran git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all. All actions completed successfully.

All completed runs finished successfully; audit outputs consistently show zero vulnerabilities.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Used tool: remove_file with input: {"filePath":"scripts/duplicate-detect.js"}
Used tool: remove_file with input: {"filePath":"scripts/duplicate-detect.cjs"}
---

**This was the result:**
---
Done — I removed the two untracked duplicate-detect files:

- scripts/duplicate-detect.js
- scripts/duplicate-detect.cjs

Next recommended step (per plan): create the commit that records the canonicalization. If you want, I can run the git add/git commit commands now (non-interactively) to record the change. Would you like me to do that?
