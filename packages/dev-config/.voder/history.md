Summary of work completed so far (history only)

- Repository & developer tooling
  - Initialized Git repo and added developer tooling: Vitest, ESLint (flat-config), Prettier, coverage reporting, npm scripts, peerDependencies, and conditional exports.
  - Added a GitHub Actions "verify" workflow (lint, format, type-check, build, tests), import-time checks, and audit:ci per ADR-0007.
  - Added SECURITY.md, audited dependencies to zero vulnerabilities, regenerated the lockfile, and upgraded esbuild.

- Package, documentation & governance
  - Renamed package to @voder/dev-config; expanded README (changelog, migration guide, API); added CONTRIBUTING.md and other docs; published docs; enforced markdownlint.
  - Created ADR-0013 (duplicate-doc cleanup) with scope, constraints, classifications, and timestamped findings.
  - Produced and committed consumer quickstart and ADR/docs artifacts.

- TypeScript migration & build pipeline
  - Migrated to strict-mode TypeScript, removed ~107 obsolete files, and adopted shared tsconfig and build presets.
  - Implemented a Prebuild → Build → Verify pipeline producing ESM and CJS bundles, .d.ts files, and asset copying.
  - Resolved TypeScript errors; dist/ contains compiled JS and declarations consistent with exports.

- Testing & coverage
  - Added ~33 Vitest suites (≈39 tests after refactor) and achieved 100% coverage.
  - Refactored vitest.config.ts to use createVitestNodeConfig and switched coverage provider to @vitest/coverage-istanbul per ADR-0009.
  - Ran targeted example tests successfully.

- Refactors, utilities & fixes
  - Removed obsolete Vite scripts; unified test helpers; cleared ESLint warnings; tightened parserOptions.
  - Added validateRuntime.ts and jsonLoader.ts with tests.
  - Patched ESLint flat-config for JSON modules; added jiti@^2.5.1 as an ESLint type-loader peerDependency; adjusted eslint exports to include src/tests.
  - Extracted ensureDir to src/utils/fs.ts; rewrote scripts/copy-assets.ts as a cross-platform, testable implementation; added safeSpawn helper with unit tests.
  - Updated prettier/build tsconfigs to extend shared presets.

- Duplicate-detection, ADR handling & scripts
  - Ran multiple duplicate-detection pipelines (Node and POSIX shell variants), producing artifacts (all-shas.txt, duplicate-report.txt, duplicate-summary.txt, per-SHA artifacts, tracking status outputs).
  - Reported exact-file duplicates for some untracked/generated paths and many candidate paths untracked by git; appended candidate ADR entries.
  - Performed a non-interactive ADR-0013 remediation run for SHA 0005f29 (preserving in-flight doc edits), appended a NO-ACTION classification, and saved remediation commits/artifacts under /tmp.
  - Created and committed scripts and docs from detection output (including scripts/duplicate-detect.sh and docs/decisions/0013-consolidation-todo-*.md).
  - Multiple detection runs reported "No tracked duplicate hashes detected" for tracked files.

- Housekeeping, lockfile & verification
  - Updated .gitignore; cleaned node_modules/dist/coverage; regenerated top-level package-lock.json (name "@voder/dev-config", version "1.0.0", lockfileVersion 3).
  - Ran npm ci --no-audit --no-fund and npm run verify after recreating the lockfile; prior verification cycles completed successfully.
  - Repeated npm audit runs and saved machine-readable outputs; reports consistently showed 0 vulnerabilities.
  - Installed husky@^8.0.0 and ran npx husky install.

- Commits, branches & repository state
  - Committed ADR updates and package-lock.json; created branch cleanup/dup-docs-and-utils and subsequent branches for fixes and consolidation.
  - Stashed tracked modifications prior to path-safety work; later working tree showed no modified tracked files, only untracked files.
  - Set local git user to "Voder Bot" <voder@example.com>.
  - Created branch cleanup/security-hardening-20250828T183725Z and committed multiple security-hardening and scripting changes.
  - Most recent pre-final commit added docs/decisions/0013-duplicate-classification-20250828T000000Z.md.
  - Final staged commit (211740eb) recorded canonical duplicate-detect choice (POSIX script) and removal of untracked JS variants (18 files changed).

- Documentation updates & checks
  - Aligned docs wording; documented coverage provider as "istanbul", createVitestNodeConfig usage, coverage thresholds, setupFiles and coverage provider.
  - Generated /tmp/all-md-shas.txt (34 tracked markdown files) and ran checks reporting "No tracked user-facing duplicate hashes detected".

- Recent checks, builds & fixes
  - Ran tracked-file duplicate checks producing ./tmp/code-shas.txt and ./tmp/code-duplicate-hashes.txt; reported "No tracked code-file duplicates detected".
  - Captured and fixed an npm run verify lint-phase failure caused by importing @voder/dev-config/eslint before compiled dist artifacts existed; fixed build ordering and metadata, then executed npm run verify successfully in earlier runs.
  - Processed duplicate-detect logs into /tmp/duplicate-report-now.log and created /tmp/duplicate-classification.json summarizing no tracked duplicates (some runs created while the repo had modified/untracked files).

- Artifacts, logs & audit outputs
  - Saved many intermediate artifacts and logs under /tmp (duplicate reports, audit outputs, build logs, verification logs, per-SHA artifacts, duplicate-classification.json, npm-audit.json, etc.).
  - Executed npm audit --json and saved the report to /tmp/npm-audit.json (auditReportVersion: 2; vulnerabilities: total=0).

- File operations & cleanup
  - Read, modified and committed numerous files (package.json, eslint/index.ts, tsconfig files, src/testing/index.ts, scripts/copy-assets.ts, etc.).
  - Rewrote and staged scripts/copy-assets.ts; added a CLI guard.
  - Removed two untracked legacy duplicate-detect files: scripts/duplicate-detect.js and scripts/duplicate-detect.cjs.

- Commands executed & outputs captured
  - Ran git ls-files, inspected .gitignore, listed scripts directory, read scripts/duplicate-detect.sh, and ran git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all.
  - Ensured canonical ADR file docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md (no overwrite) and staged/committed related changes.
  - Executed npm run generate:md-config (logged to /tmp/generate-md-config.log) — completed successfully.

- Markdown autofix & formatting
  - Ran markdown autofix (npm run lint:md:fix; markdownlint-cli2 v0.18.1); auto-fixes applied to 20 markdown files; three remaining markdownlint issues in docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md (MD033, two MD025).
  - Committed markdown autofix and formatting changes on branch cleanup/security-hardening-20250828T183725Z (commits include 7d0a4c8 and cf5bde4; formatting commit touched 11 files).

- Verify & lint autofix runs
  - Captured a verify run that reached the lint stage and produced ESLint failures: 54 problems (28 errors, 26 warnings), mainly from tracked tmp/generated files and a few unused-variable warnings in source files; that run did not complete format/build/test due to lint errors.
  - Ran npm run lint:fix; ESLint autofix completed but left 54 problems (28 errors, 26 warnings). Warnings in source files were for unused vars (copy-assets.ts, generate-markdownlint-config.ts, safe-spawn.ts). Errors originated mainly from packages/dev-config/tmp/generate-0005f29-tracking.cjs/.js (no-undef/no-console).
  - Git status at that time showed several modified (unstaged) .voder files and three modified source files (copy-assets.ts, generate-markdownlint-config.ts, safe-spawn.ts).

- Overall status highlights
  - Build/test pipeline and TypeScript migration completed; dist/ artifacts produced.
  - Test coverage reached 100%.
  - Multiple duplicate-detection and ADR workflows executed and documented; canonical ADR/decision files committed.
  - Dependency audits consistently reported zero vulnerabilities.
  - Numerous artifacts, logs and intermediate outputs saved under /tmp for inspection.

- Most recently executed action (history captured)
  - Ran npm run lint:check and saved output to /tmp/lint-check.log.
  - ESLint reported 54 problems (28 errors, 26 warnings).
  - Key files with issues:
    - scripts/copy-assets.ts: warnings for unused identifiers ('mkdir', 'stat').
    - scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts: warning for unused 'unlinkErr'.
    - src/utils/safe-spawn.ts: warning for unused 'signal' (unused args must match /^_/).
    - tmp/generate-0005f29-tracking.cjs and tmp/generate-0005f29-tracking.js: multiple errors (no-undef for 'require') and console/no-console warnings.
  - Notes saved: tmp/generate-*-tracking.* files produced most ESLint errors (generated/tracking files under tmp/); other warnings match previously noted source files.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Used tool: run_command with input: {"command":"bash","parameters":["-lc","npx eslint --fix scripts/copy-assets.ts scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts src/utils/safe-spawn.ts 2>&1 | tee /tmp/eslint-fix-targeted.log || true"]}
Used tool: read_file with input: {"filePath":"/tmp/eslint-fix-targeted.log"}
Used tool: run_command with input: {"command":"bash","parameters":["-lc","git diff --name-only | tee /tmp/git-diff-names.log || true"]}

**This was the result:**

<scratchpad>
Planned first action: run ESLint --fix on three target files and capture output.

I ran:
npx eslint --fix scripts/copy-assets.ts scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts src/utils/safe-spawn.ts 2>&1 | tee /tmp/eslint-fix-targeted.log || true

Result: ESLint autofix completed. No errors, but 4 warnings remain (autofix didn't remove them because they require manual small edits or naming changes). I then listed changed files (git diff --name-only) to see what was modified by the autofix run.

Important findings:
- ESLint output (saved at /tmp/eslint-fix-targeted.log) reports 4 warnings:
  - scripts/copy-assets.ts: 'mkdir' and 'stat' defined but never used
  - scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts: 'unlinkErr' defined but never used
  - src/utils/safe-spawn.ts: 'signal' defined but never used; rule expects unused args to start with _
- git diff shows the three target source files are changed in the working tree (plus several .voder/* files which the plan said not to modify — we'll avoid committing those).

Next planned step per the implementation plan is to commit any changes produced by the autofix (one commit per file). I will not run the commit step yet (you asked for only the first action). If you want me to proceed, I will run the commit loop next.

Logs:
- ESLint autofix output: /tmp/eslint-fix-targeted.log
- Git diff names: /tmp/git-diff-names.log

Suggested next command (per plan) to run when you want me to continue:
for f in scripts/copy-assets.ts scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts src/utils/safe-spawn.ts; do \
  if [ -f "$f" ] && ! git diff --quiet -- "$f"; then \
    git add "$f"; \
    git commit -m "fix(${f}): eslint --fix applied — refs ADR-0013"; \
  else \
    echo "No changes to commit for $f"; \
  fi; \
done

Would you like me to proceed and commit the autofix changes now?
