Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (60.13% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The project has most high-level artifacts implemented (ESLint layers, Prettier config, Vitest factory, markdown linter abstraction, many tests and docs), but it is functionally incomplete: TypeScript compilation fails due to TS6059 rootDir issues, preventing reliable builds and a recent full green test run. Code quality shows duplication and some guidance deviations. Documentation and dependency management are strong; security posture and version control are good. Resolve the build errors first to unlock accurate testing and packaging verification.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Resolve TS6059 rootDir errors: move the single top-level file reported by tsc into src (one git mv), re-run tsc, repeat one-file moves until compilation is clean, then run npm run build and the focused packaging tests.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (40% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Core features (ESLint layers, Prettier config, Vitest factory, markdown linter abstraction, build scripts and many tests) are implemented, but the package is not functionally complete: TypeScript build is failing due to files outside rootDir (TS6059), and repository contains a .eslintignore which per project policy indicates the exported `complete` ESLint config is incomplete. Until the build and root-config issues are resolved, packaging/consumer scenarios and many export-integration tests cannot be trusted.
- TypeScript compilation fails: tsc reports TS6059 errors for top-level files (scripts/*, vitest.config.ts, prettier.config.ts, etc.) not under configured rootDir -> prevents producing dist/ artifacts required by package.exports and tests.
- Project contains top-level configuration/scripts that tsc expects to be in src; current tsconfig.build.json includes those files which triggers rootDir mismatch. The planned incremental file-move approach is required.
- There is a .eslintignore in the repository for dist/, build/, coverage/, node_modules/, typescript/ — per the Universal Development Guide this is definitive evidence that the exported `complete` ESLint config does not internally handle ignores, which caps functionality and indicates consumer experience is incomplete.
- Markdown linting abstraction (linters/markdown) is implemented and exports getConfig/createCLICommand; generate-markdownlint-config script exists and tests exercise it — this area appears well-covered.
- Vitest factory createVitestNodeConfig and test setup mapping exist and are used across tests; coverage provider configured for istanbul, but packaging tests depend on a successful build to validate runtime exports.
- package.json exports target files under dist/ and types pointing to dist/*.d.ts. Because tsc/build is failing, those runtime artifacts may be outdated or inconsistent with source, breaking export-integration and consumer-install tests.
- Extensive Vitest test suite is present (many focused tests for scripts, copy-assets, packaging), indicating good test coverage, but many tests assume a successful build and/or package packing step which currently cannot be trusted due to the compile errors.
- Dependency and policy requirements (verify script includes npm audit fix --force, peerDependencies declared for tooling, ADRs present for decisions) are in place, which is strong governance, but functional deliverables (build outputs and complete ESLint export behavior) are not yet satisfied.

**Next Steps:**
- Follow the incremental plan: move the first file reported by tsc into src with a single git mv (e.g., scripts/copy-assets.ts -> src/scripts/copy-assets.ts), re-run `npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json`, and repeat one-file moves until TS6059 errors are resolved or a different error appears.
- Remove or refactor the .eslintignore workaround: either ensure the exported `complete` config internally sets the required ignores (preferred) or refactor root ESLint exports so consumers do not need `.eslintignore`. This is required to exceed the documented 50% functionality cap.
- After compilation succeeds, run `npm run build` and confirm copy-assets completed (look for the script's stderr output message). Then run the focused packaging tests (package-exports, dist-files, package-structure) and fix any remaining runtime export/path issues.
- If any packaging artifacts are missing under dist/, adjust file locations or the copy-assets script so that declared package.json exports resolve to actual files; do not commit dist/ artifacts (keep them gitignored).
- Re-run dependency-alignment tests; if they fail due to node_modules vs lockfile changes, run `npm ci` to align and, if necessary, prepare an ADR before changing lockfile or dependency versions.
- Once build and packaging tests pass locally, run `npm run verify` and address any lint/format/test failures before committing the minimal file-move changes.
- Document any layout decisions in a short ADR or README note (especially if top-level config files are moved into src) so future maintainers understand the one-file-move policy and rootDir constraints.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (30% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- The repository has many required quality tools and extensive tests, but noticeable documentation/config duplication, several guidance deviations, and redundant/unclear files reduce maintainability and adherence to the project's strict guidance.
- Quality tooling is present and configured: ESLint (flat config), Prettier (TS config), Vitest tests, markdownlint abstraction and npm scripts (lint, lint:fix, lint:md, format, verify) exist and are wired into package.json.
- Extensive test suites and build scripts are present; scripts follow the project's dual-testing strategy and CI-style verify ordering (npm audit fix --force present in verify script).
- Substantial duplicate or near-duplicate documentation files and ADRs exist (multiple decision files with overlapping content and empty/duplicated ADR stubs). The project guidance mandates documentation hygiene and unique ADRs — duplication hurts maintainability (triggers the automatic duplicate-content cap).
- There are redundant or unclear files: several decision/ADR files appear duplicated or empty (e.g., multiple 0009/0011 variants, adr- files with no content). This introduces clutter and makes it harder to reason about authoritative decisions.
- Some root-config guidance is not strictly followed: vitest.config.ts wraps and mutates the factory result (adding exclude entries) instead of being a single createVitestNodeConfig() call as required for >50% functionality by the guide; small deviations like this reduce conformity to the project's strict target patterns.
- TypeScript build issues historically surfaced (TS6059 rootDir errors) and required moving top-level config/scripts into src; while steps were taken, the existence of these recent build problems indicates friction between source layout and tsconfig expectations.
- Coverage/threshold expectations are inconsistent across docs: some places require 90% while other modules use 80%. This inconsistency weakens a single authoritative quality bar for the repo.
- Automated enforcement exists (verify script, many tests), so lack of enforcement is not a problem. However, the presence of duplicated docs and guidance deviations reduce the effective enforceability and clarity of the quality rules.

**Next Steps:**
- Remove or consolidate duplicate decision/ADR files: merge duplicates, remove empty stubs, and keep a single canonical ADR per decision (small, documented commits).
- Audit docs/decisions and prompt files for near-duplicate content and consolidate into authoritative records to remove copy-paste drift.
- Align root config files with the project's required target patterns: make vitest.config.ts a simple factory call (createVitestNodeConfig()) or document and justify deviations via ADRs.
- Resolve any remaining top-level source layout issues by following the one-file-move policy: move necessary top-level build-time scripts/configs into src and verify tsc builds cleanly.
- Unify coverage threshold expectations across documentation and config (decide 80% vs 90% and apply consistently), documenting the choice in an ADR.
- Run a repository hygiene pass to remove redundant or unused files (empty stubs, misplaced ADR copies) and re-run npm run verify to validate the full pipeline.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (45% ± 6% COMPLETE)
- Test suite is extensive with many unit and integration tests and historically high coverage, but recent TypeScript build errors prevented a recent full green run so testing quality cannot be rated above 50%.
- There is a comprehensive Vitest test suite covering scripts, lint helpers, TypeScript presets, ESLint layers, prettier export, and packaging integration (many src/tests/*.ts files).
- Historical notes indicate tests achieved very high coverage (claimed 100% in past runs) and many focused tests exist for dual testing strategy (unit + integration) for scripts.
- Several tests depend on compiled artifacts under dist/ (package-exports, dist-files, package-structure, packaging integration). These require a successful tsc build + copy-assets to run reliably.
- Most recent developer activity shows TypeScript compiler errors (TS6059/TS2209) due to files outside rootDir (scripts/, vitest.config.ts, top-level config files). The last recorded command (npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json) failed with these errors.
- Because the build failed, a full test run was not completed recently; per the hard cap rule, absence of a recent fully green run limits the score to 50% or below.
- There are dedicated tests checking dependency/lockfile alignment (src/dependency-alignment.test.ts) and packaging tests that will fail or be skipped if the build or install steps are broken, increasing fragility until the build is fixed.

**Next Steps:**
- Fix TypeScript build errors first (follow the incremental single-file move plan): move the top-level files reported by tsc into src/ one at a time (git mv), re-run `npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` after each move, and stop on the first non-TS6059/TS2209 error.
- When tsc succeeds, run `npm run build` to produce dist/ and confirm `copy-assets` completed (look for '🎉 copy-assets completed successfully' on stderr).
- Run the focused packaging tests that rely on dist: `npx vitest run src/tests/package-exports.test.ts src/tests/dist-files.test.ts src/tests/package-structure.test.ts` and fix any runtime import/export issues.
- Re-run the full test suite (`npx vitest run` or `npm test`) and ensure all tests pass; only after a successful full green run should testing completeness be rescored above 50%.
- If dependency / lockfile misalignment arises in dependency-alignment tests, run `npm ci` to align node_modules, or follow the ADR process if lockfile updates are required.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (30% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Build/test pipeline is partially implemented but not currently successful: TypeScript compilation fails (TS6059) due to files outside the configured rootDir, so the build scripts do not complete end-to-end.
- Recent tsc invocation (npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json) failed with multiple TS6059 errors: files such as scripts/copy-assets.ts, scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts, and vitest.config.ts are reported as 'not under rootDir'.
- Prebuild step (generate-markdownlint-config) succeeded previously, and some assets (dist/) exist in the repository, but the TypeScript build step does not complete because top-level build-time files are outside the TypeScript rootDir used by the compiler invocation.
- package.json build pipeline (prebuild -> build -> copy:assets) is defined, but tsc errors prevent npm run build from succeeding end-to-end at this time.
- Several repository moves were attempted (eslint.config.ts moved into src/), but at least the scripts directory and other top-level .ts config files still trigger TS6059 and block compilation.
- Because tsc fails early, downstream packaging tests (which rely on a successful dist/ layout and compiled artifacts) cannot be relied upon until compilation issues are resolved.

**Next Steps:**
- Reproduce the failure locally: run npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json to confirm the first TS6059 failure path and identify the single file referenced first.
- Follow the single-file-move discipline from the plan: git mv the first file reported by tsc into src/ (preserving directory structure), then re-run npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json. Repeat one file move per tsc run until TS6059 errors disappear or a non-TS6059 error appears.
- If a non-TS6059/TS2209 error appears after moves, stop moving files and fix that compiler error before further file moves.
- Once tsc completes cleanly, run npm run build and confirm copy-assets finishes (look for '🎉 copy-assets completed successfully' on stderr).
- Run the focused packaging tests (package-exports, dist-files, package-structure) and address any missing artifacts by moving the single missing source into src or fixing export paths as required.
- After packaging tests pass, run npm run verify and fix any remaining lint/format/test failures before committing minimal, focused changes (only the moved files and any absolutely necessary tiny tsconfig adjustments).

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (75% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Overall documentation is comprehensive and largely consumer-ready: README, API reference, usage guides, ADRs, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, and many dependency usage docs exist. There are a few inconsistencies and minor gaps (coverage thresholds, duplicated/empty ADR files, and a couple of cross-references) that reduce clarity for some consumers and maintainers.
- High-value top-level docs present: README.md (quick start, examples, compatibility, API highlights), CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, and SECURITY.md — these provide clear onboarding for users and contributors.
- API reference exists (docs/API.md) and documents primary exports (testing, eslint, prettier, typescript, markdown helpers) with example shapes and return values.
- Comprehensive usage docs are present under docs/libraries/usage (vitest, markdown-lint, eslint-plugin docs, etc.), which help developers integrate dependencies correctly.
- Decision records (docs/decisions/) are largely present and detailed for many key choices (markdownlint selection, Istanbul vs V8, dual-testing strategy, peer deps policy). This is excellent for governance and maintainers.
- Scripts and helpers are documented and examples for consumer integration (tsconfig extends, eslint.config.ts, vitest.config.ts, prettier) are included in README and other docs — good dogfooding coverage.
- Inconsistency: multiple places show differing coverage thresholds (README and some vitest docs mention 90% while other docs/guide content references 80%). This can confuse consumers about the enforced target.
- Some ADR files appear duplicated or empty (e.g., repeated 0009 and 0011 placeholders) and a few decision files reference related ADR content inconsistently, which reduces documentation cleanliness and discoverability.
- The markdown-lint generation workflow is documented, and code + script exist; README explains jiti requirement for TypeScript configs. Still, a short, single-page 'consumer checklist' tying required peer deps and tsconfig files to the exact steps a consumer must run would improve first-run experience.
- Package export expectations and packaging tests are documented and supported by tests, but API.md could more explicitly map package.json exports -> runtime paths (consumers currently infer from README/exports).
- Minor: some docs reference policies (e.g., verify order, .voder/history policies) that are internal process heavy. They are useful for LLM/agent workflows but may be overwhelming for human consumers; consider a condensed 'consumer quickstart' aside.

**Next Steps:**
- Unify coverage thresholds across docs: decide on 80% vs 90% (or differentiate package types) and update README, vitest docs, and the Universal Guide to match a single authoritative value.
- Clean up ADRs: remove or consolidate duplicated/empty ADR files (e.g., duplicate 0009, empty 0011 files) and ensure each ADR has status/front-matter and links to related decisions.
- Add a short 'Consumer Quickstart Checklist' in README (or a new docs/quickstart.md) showing the minimal steps: install peer deps (including jiti), create/extend tsconfig.eslint and tsconfig.config, drop in eslint.config.ts/prettier.config.ts/vitest.config.ts examples, and run the lint/generate scripts.
- Add an explicit mapping table in docs/API.md or README that shows package.json exports -> expected consumer import paths (e.g., './eslint' -> dist/eslint/index.js and TypeScript declaration path), to simplify export verification for consumers.
- Correct any small contradictions (verify script ordering examples, coverage provider mentions) so the documentation presents a single consistent workflow for both human and automated consumers.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (85% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Overall dependency management appears deliberate and reasonably current: dev vs peer separation is correct, vitest/coverage alignment is enforced, and project history reports a successful supply-chain audit. A few packages (notably esbuild) look older/oddly pinned and there is some overlap between coverage providers that warrant cleanup and routine SCA checks.
- Project distinguishes peerDependencies (consumer tools) from devDependencies (authoring tools) which is good practice for a configs package.
- History states an audit was run and vulnerabilities were reduced to zero; the verify script enforces `npm audit fix --force` which helps keep dependencies current (but requires monitoring for introduced breaking changes).
- Vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 are intentionally version-aligned (devDependencies use exact 3.2.4) per ADR; peerDependencies declare compat ranges — alignment is implemented to satisfy the ADR.
- Both Istanbul and V8 coverage provider packages are present (@vitest/coverage-istanbul and @vitest/coverage-v8). This is functionally acceptable for testing but creates potential confusion and increases maintenance surface; ADRs indicate preference for Istanbul for coverage-exclusion features.
- Some package versions look unusual or potentially stale (for example esbuild listed as ^0.25.9). Without an external registry check I cannot assert a CVE, but older/minor versions of tooling like bundlers have historically had security or bug fixes and should be reviewed.
- markdownlint-cli2, jiti, eslint, prettier, typescript, and vitest are declared in peers/devDeps as required — this is consistent with the package’s role as a configuration provider and mitigates consumer surprises when they install it.
- Exact version pins for some devDependencies (e.g., vitest: "3.2.4", @vitest/coverage-v8: "3.2.4") are intentional to guarantee reproducible CI/test runs; this is beneficial but requires a maintenance process to update both in lockstep.
- package.json includes useful scripts for auditing and verification (verify, audit:ci) which increases security posture if executed regularly in CI.
- No direct runtime dependencies are present (package is private and ESM config-focused), reducing the attack surface for consumers.

**Next Steps:**
- Run a fresh `npm audit --json` and a modern SCA scan (Snyk/OSS Index or GitHub Dependabot alerts) to validate the current zero-vulnerability claim from a clean environment.
- Inspect and consider upgrading tooling that looks older (notably esbuild) to a maintained minor/major line; run tests after upgrades and bundle ADRs for any pinned major bump.
- Consolidate coverage provider usage intentionally: prefer one provider (Istanbul per ADR) to reduce maintenance and avoid accidental consumer confusion; if both must remain, document rationale in an ADR.
- Ensure package-lock.json and node_modules are kept in sync in CI (use `npm ci`) and add a periodic dependency update cadence (dependabot/renovate) to surface updates and security fixes.
- Keep the exact-version alignment practice for vitest+provider but automate checks (test that versions match in package.json and lockfile) to avoid drift and false negatives in `src/dependency-alignment.test.ts`.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Overall codebase shows a low-to-moderate security risk: there are no obvious remote network calls or secret leaks in source, but build/test scripts use child_process execution and file-system writes which increase attack surface in CI or when running untrusted contributions. Dependency surface and execSync usage deserve focused review and CI hardening.
- No direct network calls or external HTTP requests are present in the source code; package is a config/tooling library and primarily performs file I/O and local process execution.
- Scripts (scripts/copy-assets.ts, scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts) perform file writes and copy operations using resolved paths. They use path.resolve and join which avoids naive string concatenation, reducing path traversal risk for the current controlled usage patterns.
- Multiple test and helper files invoke child_process.execSync (and execSync with npx) to run tsx, node, npm pack, and npm install for integration tests. Exec usage is with constructed paths from the repository; while not directly vulnerable here, execSync increases risk if inputs are ever attacker-controlled or if CI runs untrusted PRs in an environment with write/exec permissions.
- generate-markdownlint-config and copy-assets write files into the repository (e.g. .markdownlint.json, dist/). While acceptable for dev tooling, writing to repository root can overwrite files unexpectedly; ensure CI runners and maintainers run these in controlled contexts.
- validateRuntimeEnvironment uses require.resolve('jiti') which throws when missing; tests mock require.resolve. The presence of require.resolve checks is fine, but mocking in tests shows potential for accidental bypass of validation logic during test runs—ensure production CI enforces required peers.
- Preservation of file mode bits (chmod) in copy-assets may set execute bits on copied content. Ensure source files are trusted; preserving modes is appropriate but could accidentally make files executable in environments where that is risky.
- No obvious sanitization problems for the specific relative file names used (e.g., loadJSON uses fixed relative paths like './base.json'). The code does not accept arbitrary user-supplied paths for critical operations in the current repository layout.
- package.json includes many devDependencies and peerDependencies; dependency supply-chain risks remain (transitive vulnerabilities). The repository already documents audit and registry-mirror policies (ADR-0007) and runs `npm audit` in verify scripts, which helps but requires continuous monitoring.
- Tests create and execute JS modules in temporary dirs (writing test scripts then running them). Running such code in CI requires isolation and trust model controls (avoid executing untrusted PR code on shared runners).
- No secrets (keys, tokens) are visible in repo files; .env and similar are in .gitignore. Good practice observed.
- Some scripts rely on POSIX shell and tools (npm scripts using env var syntax, cp/rm). This is a portability concern more than a security issue, but CI should run these in POSIX environments as intended.

**Next Steps:**
- Perform a dependency SCA (software composition analysis) scan (e.g., `npm audit` / Snyk / GitHub Dependabot) and schedule regular automated scans; triage and patch high/critical findings promptly.
- Harden CI: run tests and package-building in isolated ephemeral runners (no persistent credentials), restrict execution of untrusted PRs (use PR gating or run untrusted PRs in sandboxed environments).
- Replace or avoid execSync calls where possible with child_process.spawn/execFile using argument arrays (no shell interpolation) and explicit environment controls; validate and sanitize any path inputs used with exec.
- Limit file writes during test runs to temp directories (avoid writing into repo root) or ensure tests run in fully ephemeral workspaces; treat any test-created executable artifacts cautiously.
- Add explicit checks/validation around any input used in subprocess calls or file operations. For integration tests that pack+install local tarballs, ensure the tarball and install contexts are trusted.
- Continuously monitor and pin critical tooling versions (Vitest, Prettier, ESLint plugins) where necessary; maintain lockfile hygiene and ensure package-lock.json is present and validated by CI.
- Add runtime / build-time integrity checks where appropriate (e.g., verify tarball checksums before local install in automated flows) and document the trust model for running build/test tasks.
- Document CI runner security expectations (no secrets mounted during npm pack/install steps) and ensure registry-mirror configuration (per SECURITY.md) is enforced in CI environments.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (96% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- Repository exhibits excellent version-control hygiene: clean working tree, zero uncommitted files, and branch fully synchronized with origin. Critical sources and docs are tracked and common build artifacts are correctly git-ignored.
- Working directory is clean: git status shows no staged/unstaged or untracked files (0 uncommitted files).
- Branch is up to date with origin/main (no unpushed commits), so remote synchronization is good.
- Key source files, configs, and documentation are tracked (src/, eslint/, typescript/, docs/).
- Build outputs and transient files are excluded in .gitignore (dist/, node_modules/, coverage/, .eslintcache, etc.).
- A small set of git-ignored files are visible to the tooling via .voderignore negation (intended for LLM inspection) but remain properly ignored by git.
- No merge conflicts or repository corruption indicators are present in the provided status.
- Project file counts are consistent (tracked files ~96, untracked 0); a minor note: a reported 'Project files tracked: 87/88' suggests one metadata mismatch to verify, but it does not indicate a version-control break.

**Next Steps:**
- Verify package-lock.json is tracked and aligned with node_modules (dependency-alignment tests reference it).
- Run a quick local 'git status' and 'git log --oneline -n 5' before major changes to ensure no ephemeral local commits are left unpushed.
- Periodically audit the repo for accidental committed build artifacts (git ls-files dist/ should return nothing); remove and add to .gitignore if found.
- Optionally reconcile the 'Project files tracked' count discrepancy (87/88) to confirm no intended source file is missing from tracking.
