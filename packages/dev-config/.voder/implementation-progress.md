![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (94% ± 10% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
Overall implementation meets most requirements but documentation is lacking key guides and code quality needs minor improvements.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Add the missing TypeScript and Vitest needs guides and update the README to reference them



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (100% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- All core functional requirements—TypeScript presets, ESLint flat config layers, Prettier settings, Vitest factory, and Markdown lint abstraction—are implemented, exposed via proper exports, and thoroughly tested with no failing tests.
- TypeScript presets (base, node, library, test) load correctly from JSON and are re-exported.
- ESLint flat config layers (base, dx, performance, complete) cover all file patterns and globals as specified.
- Prettier configuration is provided as a TypeScript module and validated by tests.
- Vitest Node configuration factory returns correct shape with coverage thresholds and setup files.
- Markdown lint abstraction exports getConfig() and createCLICommand(), matching ADR-0006 requirements.
- Comprehensive Vitest tests cover export equivalence, package exports, integration, and smoke tests.
- Utility modules (jsonLoader, validateRuntime) behave as expected and throw clear errors.
- Asset copying and build scripts correctly include JSON and JS assets into dist/ and preserve modes.

**Next Steps:**
- Add documentation in docs/libraries/needs for TypeScript preset requirements (dev-config-typescript-needs.md).
- Add documentation in docs/libraries/needs for Vitest factory requirements (dev-config-vitest-needs.md).
- Update docs/README.md to reference the new "needs" guides for ESLint, TypeScript, and Vitest.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (92% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- The codebase robustly implements the project’s quality standards: ESLint, Prettier, and markdownlint are fully configured and enforced via npm scripts; TypeScript configs and peer dependency guidance are followed; tests provide full coverage. Minor test‐pattern duplication is present but does not undermine overall maintainability.
- ESLint 9 flat config with base, dx, performance layers is defined and consumed via scripts 'lint', 'lint:fix', 'lint:check'.
- Prettier config in TypeScript is provided and used in 'format' and 'format:check' scripts with the required NODE_OPTIONS flag.
- Markdownlint-cli2 is chosen per ADR, with getConfig() and createCLICommand() exports, and .markdownlint.json generated via script.
- TypeScript presets and JSON configs for eslint and config files are exported and validated by tests, matching guidance.
- validateRuntimeEnvironment enforces jiti installation and presence of JSON configs, as specified in docs.
- Comprehensive Vitest test suites cover exports, package structure, integration, and error cases with 100% coverage.
- Minor duplication in test files (similar import‐equivalence patterns) could be refactored into shared helpers, but overall code organization remains strong.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (95% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- The test suite has recently run to completion with zero failures and covers a wide range of functionality.
- Recent CI completed a full Vitest run: 39 tests across 15 files passed without errors
- Tests cover public API surface, package export integration, smoke tests, and utility functions
- Dependency alignment and JSON loader tests validate critical scenarios
- Coverage thresholds of 90% are enforced in configuration tests

**Next Steps:**
- Continue monitoring for flakiness on new test additions
- Add tests for emerging configuration features
- Ensure test maintenance as project evolves

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (100% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- All verification steps succeeded: build, tests, linting, and asset generation completed without errors.
- TypeScript compilation via tsc -p tsconfig.build.json succeeded
- Vitest test suites (39 files across 15 suites) all passed
- ESLint flat config linting completed with zero warnings
- Prettier format and format:check scripts ran without errors
- Markdown lint config generation script produced valid .markdownlint.json
- Package export integration and structure tests validated all dist artifacts
- Dependency alignment tests confirmed version alignment for vitest and coverage provider

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (80% ± 7% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is comprehensive but missing key "needs" guides for TypeScript and Vitest, and the README isn't updated to reference them.
- README provides detailed Quick Start, Purpose, Compatibility, Usage, API Reference, and Troubleshooting sections.
- docs/API.md covers module references for testing, ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, and Markdown.
- docs/libraries/usage contains essential usage docs for esbuild, ESLint plugins, markdown linting, and Vitest.
- Only one "needs" guide exists (dev-config-needs.md); missing TypeScript and Vitest "needs" specification docs.
- README and docs index do not reference TypeScript and Vitest needs files.

**Next Steps:**
- Author docs/libraries/needs/dev-config-typescript-needs.md outlining TS preset export requirements and usage.
- Author docs/libraries/needs/dev-config-vitest-needs.md outlining Vitest factory API and coverage requirements.
- Update README.md to include links to all three "needs" guides under docs/libraries/needs.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (90% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are well managed with aligned peer/dev versions and no known vulnerabilities; only esbuild is notably outdated.
- Peer and dev dependencies for TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, and Markdown linting are declared and version-aligned
- Vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 exact versions are matched and verified by automated tests
- TypeScript, ESLint plugins, Prettier, and markdownlint-cli2 use modern major versions with caret ranges
- No high-severity vulnerabilities found in recent audit: npm audit --audit-level=high passed
- Dev-only tool esbuild is on v0.25.9 which is several major versions behind current; usage is limited to scripts

**Next Steps:**
- Consider upgrading esbuild to latest stable major release if it's actively used in build scripts
- Periodically run `npm audit` and update dependencies to address any emerging security issues
- Review peer dependency ranges to ensure compatibility with the most recent minor versions of tools

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (95% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- No major security vulnerabilities detected; the codebase follows best practices for a configuration package.
- Public API contains only pure configuration objects and no network or side-effectful operations
- Scripts using execSync are limited to test and build contexts, executing only static, package-controlled code
- jsonLoader and validateRuntimeEnvironment perform safe file system checks without exposing user input
- Peer dependencies and markdown lint generation do not introduce runtime risks
- No use of eval, dynamic code execution, or unvalidated user input in production code

**Next Steps:**
- Review and document execSync usages to ensure no future introduction of untrusted input
- Continue dependency audits to catch any new vulnerabilities in peer or dev dependencies
- Consider adding automated security scanning in CI (e.g., Snyk or GitHub CodeQL) for ongoing monitoring

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (98% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- Version control practices are strong with no conflicts, proper ignores, and minimal uncommitted changes.
- Branch is up to date with remote; no ahead or behind commits.
- Only two uncommitted changes detected: one modified README.md and one new documentation file.
- Total uncommitted files under 10, indicating good commit discipline.
- Build artifacts (dist/, node_modules/) are correctly ignored by .gitignore.
- No merge conflicts or repository corruption detected.

**Next Steps:**
- Stage and commit the modified README.md and the new docs/libraries/needs/dev-config-needs.md file to bring working tree to a clean state.
