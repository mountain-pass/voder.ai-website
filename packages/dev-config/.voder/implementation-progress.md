Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETE (96% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
All assessment areas exceed the 95% threshold with comprehensive implementation, high code quality, thorough testing, and robust documentation and execution.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Continue to monitor dependencies and update ADRs as needed



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (95% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- The package fulfills the vast majority of requirements: TypeScript presets, ESLint flat config, Prettier, Vitest factories, and markdown linting are all implemented, tested, and documented as specified. The JSON exports, scripts, ADRs, and CI pipeline are in place and passing, with comprehensive end-to-end tests. One minor gap is that the runtime validation function is implemented but not automatically invoked when loading configurations.
- TypeScript presets (base, node, library, test) and JSON exports are loaded and verified via tests.
- ESLint exports include a complete flat config (`complete`) with proper file coverage, ignores, and environment-specific globals.
- Prettier configuration is provided as a TypeScript file, imported and tested successfully.
- Vitest factory (`createVitestNodeConfig`) exposes correct structure and coverage thresholds, used in root and consumer configs.
- Markdown linting abstraction (`getConfig`, `createCLICommand`) uses markdownlint-cli2, is tested, and peerDependency is declared.
- Scripts for build, test, lint, markdown lint, and asset copying are configured and exercised in CI.
- ADR records cover tooling selections, governance, and security policies.
- The `validateRuntimeEnvironment` utility checks for `jiti` and JSON configs but is not invoked by default.

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate `validateRuntimeEnvironment()` invocation (e.g., in package entry or generate script) to enforce setup checks automatically.
- Document the runtime validation step in README so consumers know when and how to run it.
- Optionally add automated pre-import hooks to surface clear errors for missing peer dependencies or TS config files.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (95% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- The project demonstrates excellent adherence to its own quality standards: strict TypeScript usage, ESLint flat-config v9, Prettier formatting, markdownlint-cli2 rules, ADR governance, and comprehensive test coverage are all in place. Quality tools are configured, enforced via npm scripts, and validated in tests. No significant duplication or redundant files are present.
- ESLint flat-config v9 is configured (base, dx, performance layers) and integrated in scripts (lint, lint:fix, lint:check).
- Prettier config is provided in TypeScript as `prettier.config.ts`, used in format scripts with NODE_OPTIONS.
- Markdown linting uses markdownlint-cli2 with a shared `.markdownlint.json` and generation script (generate:md-config).
- TypeScript configurations include strict mode, ESM output, JSON loading, and are exported and tested (tsconfig-exports tests).
- Comprehensive Vitest test suites cover public API, export equivalence, package structure, and helper utilities, achieving 100% coverage.
- validateRuntimeEnvironment and jsonLoader utilities exist with corresponding tests for missing dependencies and file errors.
- No duplicate logic across modules; JSON presets are loaded via shared loader instead of copy-pasting.
- Project guidance (ADR governance, console-first policy, .gitignore/.voderignore rules) is followed and enforced.

**Next Steps:**
- Consider adding pre-commit hooks (e.g., Husky) to enforce linting and formatting locally before commits.
- Review markdownlint CLI scripts to explicitly reference the generated config file for clarity (`--config .markdownlint.json`).
- Periodically audit ADRs to ensure documentation stays in sync with evolving tooling requirements.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (95% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- The test suite is consistently green with comprehensive coverage and robust integration and smoke tests, demonstrating excellent reliability.
- Recent CI run completed with 39 Vitest tests across 15 files, all passing with zero failures.
- Test coverage is reported at 100% across all metrics, exceeding the 90% threshold requirement.
- Tests cover unit, integration, export-equivalence, package-structure, runtime validation, and smoke scenarios.
- Error handling and peer dependency alignment are validated through dedicated tests, ensuring environment correctness.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue adding tests for any new features or configuration paths introduced.
- Periodically review test execution times and address any emerging flakiness or performance regressions.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (100% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- The project builds successfully, all 39 Vitest suites pass, linting and formatting scripts run without errors, and package exports resolve correctly.
- npm run build and copy-assets complete without errors and generate expected dist output
- npm test runs all Vitest suites with 100% coverage and no failures
- ESLint flat config scripts lint and lint:fix succeed with zero warnings
- Prettier format and format:check run correctly using experimental strip-types flag
- Markdown lint generation script creates .markdownlint.json without errors
- Package export integration tests confirm all exports resolve and function as intended
- Runtime environment validation ensures required jiti and tsconfig JSON files exist

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (95% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- The documentation is comprehensive and well‐organized, covering quickstart, in-depth usage guides, API reference, troubleshooting, governance ADRs, and security policies.
- README.md includes Quick Start, Purpose, Compatibility & Requirements, Installation, Usage examples for TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, and Markdown linting.
- API Reference (docs/API.md) clearly lists all exports, types, and usage signatures for each module.
- docs/libraries/usage contains dedicated usage guides for complex dependencies (esbuild, eslint-plugin-import, unicorn, markdownlint-cli2, Vitest).
- docs/decisions contains MADR-formatted ADRs documenting architectural and dependency decisions.
- CONTRIBUTING.md outlines contribution workflow, branch sync, and pre-push verification steps.
- SECURITY.md details supply-chain audit and registry-mirror policies.
- .editorconfig, .gitignore, and markdownlint configuration files enforce consistent formatting and repository hygiene.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (95% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- All dependencies and peer dependencies are current, well-aligned, and no significant vulnerabilities are reported.
- DevDependencies such as eslint, prettier, vitest, and esbuild are at their latest minor/patch versions.
- Peer dependency ranges are compatible and match the devDependency versions, ensuring consumer compatibility.
- No high‐severity vulnerabilities detected; npm audit fix --force completes without failures.
- Markdownlint, jiti, and TypeScript presets are up to date and actively maintained.
- Exact version alignment for vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 is correctly enforced per ADR-0005.

**Next Steps:**
- Schedule regular dependency audits and upgrade cycles to catch future updates.
- Review peer dependency ranges periodically to tighten ranges if necessary.
- Monitor security advisories for critical libraries and apply patches promptly.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (100% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- No security issues detected; code follows best practices, contains no network or untrusted input handling, and includes supply-chain audit policies.
- All file operations use controlled, project-relative paths without user-controlled input.
- ExecSync commands are invoked with static strings, no unsanitized external parameters.
- No network or external data fetching or parsing occurs at runtime.
- validateRuntimeEnvironment verifies only local files and peer dependency resolution.
- Supply-chain audit and registry-mirror policy is documented and enforced via audit:ci script.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue running `npm run audit:ci` regularly to catch new vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- Consider adding dependency integrity checking and lockfile validation in CI.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (95% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- Repository is well-managed with clean working tree, proper ignore patterns, and full synchronization with remote.
- Working directory is clean with no uncommitted files.
- Branch 'main' is up to date with origin/main with no unpushed commits.
- Critical source code, configuration, and documentation are tracked.
- Build artifacts, dependencies, and temporary files are properly git-ignored.
- No merge conflicts or repository corruption detected.

**Next Steps:**
- Maintain regular pushes to remote to ensure collaboration visibility.
- Periodically review .gitignore to catch any new unwanted artifacts.
- Continue committing small, incremental changes to preserve history clarity.
