# Implementation Progress Assessment

**Generated:** 2025-08-09T11:02:11.129Z

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (12% ± 6% COMPLETE)

## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (12% ± 6% COMPLETE)
- The project documents a comprehensive @voder/dev-config package (TypeScript, ESLint, build, testing, prettier, etc.) and provides extensive guidance in prompts/docs.
- However, there is no visible working implementation for the package at the moment:
  - package.json contains placeholder scripts that do not perform real builds, tests, linting, or formatting.
  - There is no src/ directory or actual implementation code for the dev-config package in the repository snapshot.
  - The repository state shows many deletions and untracked files related to internal prompts/docs, suggesting a refactor or cleanup in progress rather than a working feature-ready package.
- Requested features (the actual Dev-Config package providing configuration factories and exports) are not yet implemented in code. Documentation exists, but the executable pieces (exports, factory functions, TS/Lint/Build configurations wired into code) are missing or not wired up.
- As a result, functionality is not met. The project only has conceptual guidance and scaffolding in prompts/docs, not a runnable, verifiable product.

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT ([12% ± 6% COMPLETE])
- No real source code to evaluate:
  - No src/ implementation for the package.
  - No TypeScript types, exports, or build configurations implemented in code.
- With only documentation present, there is no executable code to be linted, type-checked, or compiled. Therefore, code quality cannot be assessed as functional yet.
- Risk: when code is added, it should adhere to the design principles in prompts (interface contracts, DI patterns, strict boundaries, etc.). Clear scaffolding and small, testable steps will be essential.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT ([0% ± 0% COMPLETE])
- No tests present for the dev-config package in the current state.
- The documentation describes Vitest-based testing and interface validations, but there are no test files or test configurations in code to verify.
- To reach acceptable test coverage (per guidance), we would need unit tests for interfaces, configuration validation, and basic integration of build/test configurations.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT ([0% ± 0% COMPLETE])
- The software has not been executed or validated end-to-end:
  - No build/run commands are wired in actual code; npm scripts in package.json merely echo messages.
  - No runtime verification of the dev-config package functionality is possible in the current state.
- Background processes are not running (as per .voder/.processes.json), which aligns with the absence of an executable setup in code.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT ([60% ± 12% COMPLETE])
- There is substantial documentation present in prompts and docs describing the intended architecture, conventions, and usage patterns for @voder/dev-config (typescript, eslint, build, testing, prettier, etc.).
- Documentation quality is high for design decisions, implementation patterns, and expectations (contracts, DI, API design, testing standards).
- However:
  - Documentation describes a package that should exist in code; the gap is the actual code that implements these contracts.
  - README isolation rules are specified, but there is no public-facing README per package in the codebase snapshot to satisfy those requirements yet.
- Overall documentation is robust as a knowledge base, but it does not reflect a complete, runnable package in this repository state.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT ([60% ± 12% COMPLETE])
- package.json lists a set of dependencies relevant to the described configuration package (eslint plugins, rollup, vite, vitest, testing-library, etc.).
- Versions shown are plausible for a modern setup, but:
  - The project appears to be in a state of refactor or partial implementation; it’s unclear if all dependencies are aligned with the actual implemented code (which is currently absent).
  - No security vulnerability scan results are provided. With many dev tooling dependencies, timely updates are important; the repository should be audited and kept up to date.
- Given the absence of actual code, dependency freshness can’t be validated beyond the surface level in package.json.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT ([60% ± 12% COMPLETE])
- No explicit security issues are visible in the documentation alone; the codebase’s current state cannot be assessed for runtime security vulnerabilities because the implementation is not present.
- Potential concerns to address in the next iteration:
  - Ensure dependencies are up to date and free of known vulnerabilities.
  - If any code handles user input or configuration, implement validation, sanitization, and safe defaults per the guide.
- Security posture will largely depend on the actual code added in the next implementation phase.

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- The project is not yet a complete, runnable implementation of the requested software. It provides strong documentation and design guidance for a universal development configuration package but lacks the actual codebase to satisfy functionality, testing, and execution requirements.
- Documentation exists and is high-quality, but the essential code artifacts (src/, exports, build scripts, test suites) are not implemented.
- Therefore, the overall status is INCOMPLETE.

## NEXT PRIORITY
- Implement the minimal, working skeleton of @voder/dev-config as code:
  - Create a proper src/index.ts exporting the expected API (typescript, eslint, build, testing) per the guidance.
  - Implement the TypeScript configuration variants (base.json, vite.json, node.json, library.json, test.json) as JSON files under src/typescript, with existing base.json content adapted as needed.
  - Implement ESLint configuration modules (base.js, accessibility.js, performance.js, dx.js) under src/eslint and wire them into an eslint.config.js export that packages can consume.
  - Implement the build configuration factories (rollup.config.js, vite.config.js) under src/build and export createPackageConfig and createAppConfig as documented.
  - Implement the testing configuration (vitest.config.js) under src/testing and provide test-utils.ts/test-setup.ts as described.
  - Provide a minimal README.md per package with the required sections (Purpose, Installation, Usage, API Reference, Development) and ensure it’s self-contained (no internal links).
  - Add unit tests (at least interface compliance, configuration validation, and basic error handling) to demonstrate 90%+ function coverage and 100% coverage of the public API as per the universal standards.
  - Run a full local cycle (build, test, lint, format) to ensure all criteria are satisfied and fix any issues that arise.
- After the skeleton exists, incrementally implement features (one small, testable change at a time) to align with the “LLM-First Development” approach described in prompts.
