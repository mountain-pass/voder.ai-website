![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (81.12% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
Overall the project is functionally complete with strong tests, build and documentation, but code quality is degraded by duplicated/transient generated artifacts and lint failures. Addressing lint noise and consolidating duplicates will raise overall quality and allow a clean verify run.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Run targeted per-file ESLint fixes (or minimal renames for unused params), commit each change, then run npm run verify to ensure the pipeline is fully green.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (92% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The package implements the requested core features: TypeScript presets, ESLint flat-config layers including a complete export, Prettier TypeScript configuration, Vitest testing factory (Istanbul coverage), a markdownlint abstraction and CLI-generator, testable build scripts, and comprehensive test suites. Most consumer-facing APIs and dual export patterns are present and well-covered by tests.
- TypeScript presets: base/node/library/test JSON presets exist and are exported; tsconfig build and eslint-specific configs are provided and used by tests.
- ESLint: base, dx, performance layers are implemented and aggregated into `complete` (also default export). Root eslint.config.ts is minimal and points at the exported config as intended.
- Prettier: prettier.config.ts is implemented in TypeScript and re-exported for consumers; matches ADR guidance.
- Testing: createVitestNodeConfig() returns a Node-targeted config with Istanbul coverage and thresholds; testSetup mapping provided.
- Markdown linting: linters/markdown implements getConfig() and createCLICommand(); package.json lists markdownlint-cli2 in peerDependencies and devDependencies for development.
- Build scripts: copy-assets and generate-markdownlint-config follow the testable 'main function + minimal CLI' pattern and have unit + integration tests.
- Exports & packaging: package.json exports map to dist/ runtime artifacts; tests include package export integration and consumer install smoke tests.
- Extensive test coverage: many vitest suites exercise exports, scripts, utilities, and packaging behaviors (history indicates verify completed previously).
- Minor outstanding hygiene issues noted in history: transient tmp/ generated artifacts previously caused ESLint errors (a conservative .eslintignore entry for tmp/ was added), and a few unused-variable warnings were identified and are being fixed.
- Some tests and tooling expect a package-lock and compiled dist artifacts; these are present in prior runs but are part of the verification flow and must be kept in sync when changing build outputs.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the full verify pipeline locally (npm run verify) to confirm current working tree passes lint/build/test after the recent .eslintignore and autofix commits.
- Execute the planned focused lint-fix sequence for the remaining source-file warnings (rename unused-catch/param names to _prefixed identifiers where appropriate) and commit each change separately per the plan.
- Remove or narrow any broad .eslintignore entries after fixes so only true generated/transient folders are ignored (prefer targeted ignores).
- Re-run package export and installation integration tests (dist-based consumer tests) to ensure exported dist artifacts remain consistent after any commits.
- Once lint/format/tests are clean, finalize ADR-0013 confirmation notes and run the duplicate-detection script to record the post-fix state.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (25% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- The project has most required quality tools (ESLint flat config, Prettier, Vitest, markdownlint-cli2, verify script including npm audit fix) and many tests, but documented/tracked duplicate content and transient/generated artifacts (tmp/*, multiple ADR duplicates and generated coverage artifacts) exist and are actively causing lint failures. Because the presence of duplicated/substantially-similar content triggers the strict cap in the guidance, the overall code quality score is low despite tooling being present.
- Required tooling is present and configured: ESLint (flat config layers under eslint/ and eslint.config.ts), Prettier (prettier.config.ts), Vitest (createVitestNodeConfig factory + vitest.config.ts), markdownlint abstraction and package.json scripts (lint:md, lint:md:fix), and a 'verify' script that starts with 'npm audit fix --force'.
- Comprehensive test suites exist (many Vitest tests), TypeScript strict mode is used, and TypeScript JSON presets are exported; these meet the project's functional and testing expectations.
- Multiple files show duplication / near-duplicate content in tracked docs and ADRs (several 0013-* ADR files, duplicate-detection artifacts referenced in docs). The project recorded duplicate-detection activity and left multiple related files (candidate ADR files), satisfying the 'duplicate content' mandatory check and triggering the automatic maximum cap (per project rules).
- Transient/generated artifacts (tmp/generate-*.js/.cjs and other tmp/* outputs) caused the majority of current ESLint errors; although a conservative .eslintignore entry has been committed to silence them, this is a workaround masking root hygiene issues and indicates redundant/unnecessary files were previously tracked or visible to linters.
- There are still actionable lint warnings in source files (unused variables/params in scripts/copy-assets.ts, scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts, src/utils/safe-spawn.ts) that need minimal edits to satisfy the strict lint check; the project plan documents steps to fix these.
- Automated enforcement exists (verify script, husky installed previously), but pre-commit hooks and CI gating are not fully visible in the repository state presented — enforcement exists at the script level but may not be fully integrated into hooks/CI for immediate blocking of problematic commits.

**Next Steps:**
- Complete the planned NOW step: add only a targeted ignore for truly transient, generated directories (tmp/) and commit (already done in history) — but then run focused lint diagnostics and remove any tracked generated files instead of widening ignores.
- Run the NEXT sequence: generate /tmp/lint-remaining-files.txt, run ESLint per-file, apply conservative fixes (rename unused params to _prefixed names, fix unused-catch vars), commit single-file fixes, and re-run npm run lint:check until clean.
- Remove or untrack any generated files that ended up in source control (ensure .gitignore is accurate and do not rely on broad .eslintignore to mask problems). Re-run duplicate-detection and consolidate ADR docs per ADR-0013 to eliminate tracked duplication.
- Ensure husky + lint-staged hooks are enabled and configured to run lint/format/markdown checks locally, and confirm CI runs the same 'verify' pipeline so the quality gates are enforced automatically.
- After lint is clean, run markdown autofix and Prettier format, then run the full verify pipeline (npm run verify) and address any remaining build/test issues discovered.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (90% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Test suite is comprehensive and historically achieved full green runs with very high coverage; recent repository activity shows linting issues but no clear evidence of failing tests, so testing remains strong though verification pipeline is currently noisy due to transient generated artifacts.
- Extensive Vitest suites exist across the repo (many unit, integration, and smoke tests targeting scripts, config exports, and package installation flows).
- Repository history records achieving 100% coverage and successful verification runs in previous cycles (tests + coverage were green).
- Test files exercise core functionality: ESLint layers, TypeScript presets, Prettier export, markdown linter, scripts (unit+integration), and package export integration.
- Current problems logged in recent runs are primarily ESLint failures caused by transient/generated tmp/ artifacts and a few unused-variable warnings in source files; no explicit recent test failures were reported in the activity history.
- Dual-testing strategy for scripts (unit + integration) is implemented, enabling reliable coverage measurement while preserving end-to-end checks.

**Next Steps:**
- Run a fresh full test run from repository root: `npm test` and capture output (confirm zero failures).
- Execute the full verify pipeline `npm run verify` after ignoring/cleaning transient tmp/ artifacts and inspect `/tmp/verify-after-fix.log` to confirm tests remain green in the full pipeline.
- If `npm run verify` fails, inspect `/tmp/test-fail.log` (or run `npx vitest run --reporter=verbose`) and fix any failing tests before proceeding.
- Address lint warnings in source files (rename unused params to `_name`, fix unused imports) and ensure generated tmp/ artifacts are excluded from linting to avoid masking real test issues.
- Re-run coverage reporting and validate thresholds (80%+ across metrics) to ensure coverage remains enforced and stable.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (92% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The project has a working build/test pipeline and compiled artifacts (dist/) with prior successful verify/test runs; most runtime and packaging checks appear to pass. Remaining issues are mostly linting noise from transient generated tmp/ artifacts and a handful of minor unused-variable warnings that should be fixed quickly.
- Build outputs (dist/) exist and package.json exports point to compiled files; package-structure tests and earlier integration tests ran successfully per recorded history.
- The repository has previously executed the full verify pipeline and achieved 100% coverage; artifacts and package-lock.json were produced and used in integration tests (npm pack / consumer install flows).
- Current outstanding failures are primarily ESLint diagnostics (54 problems reported) where the majority of errors originate from transient tmp/ generated artifacts; a conservative .eslintignore entry for tmp/ was added and committed to address this.
- There remain a few source-file warnings (unused variables / unused catch names) in scripts/copy-assets.ts, scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts, and src/utils/safe-spawn.ts that require minimal edits (rename to _prefixed identifiers or remove unused bindings).
- No evidence of systemic runtime failures (build or test regressions) after the documented autofix commits; verification previously succeeded after build-order fixes and asset copying adjustments.
- Package export integration and smoke tests rely on dist artifacts and package-lock; these were produced and validated previously, but final confirmation requires re-running the local verify after the remaining lint fixes.

**Next Steps:**
- Ensure the committed .eslintignore (tmp/) is present in the working tree and re-run ESLint to confirm generated artifacts are excluded: npx eslint . --max-warnings 0
- Run focused per-file ESLint diagnostics for remaining files and apply minimal edits (rename unused params/catch variables to _name or remove unused imports): npx eslint -f unix <file> and npx eslint --fix <file>
- Run full project verification to confirm build/tests/formatting: npm run verify and inspect /tmp/verify-after-fix.log for any regressions
- If verify fails, capture targeted logs (npm run build, npx vitest run --reporter=verbose) and fix the smallest set of files per failure, reverting any automated commit that causes a regression
- Once lint is clean and verify passes, run the package integration tests that pack and install the tarball (src/tests/dist-imports.test.ts / helpers) to confirm consumer import paths still work

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is comprehensive and well-structured for both consumers and maintainers: README, consumer quickstart, API reference, usage guides, ADRs, and security guidance are present. A few consolidation and clarity improvements would raise usability for first-time integrators and reduce duplication.
- README.md: strong quickstart, installation, and usage examples (TypeScript, Prettier, Vitest, ESLint). Peer dependencies and jiti requirement are clearly listed.
- docs/CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md: practical, copy/paste-ready steps including tsconfig templates and exact npm scripts; covers Node and jiti caveats.
- docs/API.md: concise reference for primary exports (testing, eslint, prettier, typescript, markdown) with expected shapes and properties.
- docs/libraries/usage/: useful per-dependency guidance (esbuild, eslint-plugin-import, unicorn, markdownlint, vitest) — valuable for consumers integrating complex tools.
- docs/decisions/: extensive ADRs capture governance and rationale, which is excellent for maintainers and auditors; ADRs are detailed and actionable.
- Linters & scripts docs: .markdownlint.json generation and markdown lint usage are documented with CLI examples and script helpers.
- Coverage & testing guidance: vitest factory usage, coverage provider rationale (Istanbul), and dual testing strategy are documented and tied to ADRs.
- Duplication and formatting: there is some duplicated/near-duplicate documentation (ADR-0013 acknowledges this). A few docs contain overlapping wording and internal notes that could be consolidated for clarity.
- Complexity & caveats: some consumer steps require Node flags (NODE_OPTIONS="--experimental-strip-types") and jiti; while documented, they may be non-obvious and could use a short troubleshooting subsection with common errors and fixes.
- Export validation: package.json exports are documented but consumers would benefit from a small table mapping each public export path to its purpose and an explicit example for the preferred one-line eslint usage.

**Next Steps:**
- Consolidate duplicate user-facing docs per ADR-0013: merge overlapping content (README, CONSUMER-QUICKSTART, docs/API.md, docs/libraries/usage/*) to reduce repeated guidance and single-source common snippets.
- Add a short Troubleshooting section in CONSUMER-QUICKSTART or README that addresses the most common onboarding issues: missing jiti, Node flag usage for TS config loading, eslint flat-config pitfalls, and how to verify package exports (quick commands).
- Provide a compact Export Map table in README or docs/API.md that lists each package export path (e.g. ./testing, ./prettier, ./eslint) with one-line description and a minimal consumer import example.
- Document a minimal checklist for consumer setup verification (commands to run and expected quick outputs), and add explicit guidance for cross-platform notes regarding NODE_OPTIONS and quoting in npm scripts.
- After consolidation, run markdownlint and a docs smoke test to ensure examples remain accurate; keep docs/libraries/usage files up-to-date when dependency versions change.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are generally current and well-managed with audited zero-vulnerability state; some intentional exact pins and a redundant coverage provider increase maintenance burden but do not present immediate security issues.
- Security/audit: Project history shows npm audit runs with zero reported vulnerabilities and the verify script enforces `npm audit fix --force` as part of CI-local checks.
- Version freshness: Key toolchain packages are modern (TypeScript ^5.x, Prettier 3.x, ESLint 9.x, Vitest 3.x). Many devDependencies use recent versions in package.json.
- Intentional exact pins: vitest and coverage provider packages are pinned exactly (devDependencies: "vitest": "3.2.4", "@vitest/coverage-istanbul": "3.2.4", "@vitest/coverage-v8": "3.2.4"). This is deliberate per ADR-0005 (version alignment) and reduces upgrade flexibility but improves deterministic behavior.
- Peer dependency management: Consumer-facing peerDependencies are declared (eslint, prettier, typescript, vitest, markdownlint-cli2, jiti, etc.), which is correct for a config package and helps consumers surface missing tooling.
- Potential redundancy: Both @vitest/coverage-istanbul and @vitest/coverage-v8 appear in devDependencies. ADR-0009 selected Istanbul as the canonical coverage engine, so the V8 provider may be unnecessary and increases surface area to maintain.
- Notable outlier: esbuild is present (devDependencies: "esbuild": "^0.25.9"). Depending on the current upstream cadence this may be older than the latest stable line; schedule targeted check/upgrade if used in build paths.
- Lockfile & reproducibility: A package-lock.json was generated and used in verification runs (history indicates lockfileVersion 3). Regular lockfile regeneration and audit runs are in place.
- Tooling consistency: jiti and markdownlint-cli2 are present and documented (jiti required for TS config loading). The package enforces these via peer/dev dep patterns and documentation, reducing runtime surprises for consumers.

**Next Steps:**
- Run a focused `npm outdated` and produce a short upgrade plan for non-critical packages (esbuild, nyc, eslint plugins) and capture potential breaking changes in ADRs where major versions are involved.
- Consider removing the redundant @vitest/coverage-v8 devDependency if not required (or document reason for keeping) to reduce maintenance surface; verify removal via `npm run test:ci`.
- Keep exact pins only where ADR-mandated (e.g., vitest/provider alignment); convert other devDependencies to caret ranges to reduce friction for minor/patch updates while still using lockfile for reproducibility.
- Continue regular `npm audit --json` reporting in CI and schedule periodic dependency review (monthly) with change ADRs for major upgrades.
- Before any mass upgrades, run `npm run verify` (audit/lint/format/build/test) in a feature branch and capture failures to fix small, focused regressions per the repository workflow.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (82% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Overall the repository demonstrates many strong secure practices (no eval, spawn uses shell:false, path-traversal checks in copy script, atomic write & rename pattern). Remaining risks are operational/configuration: mandated use of npm audit fix --force in verify, some uses of execSync and subprocess string interpolation in tests/scripts, and a few atomic-rename / TOCTOU edge cases around file replacement that merit hardening.
- Good: No use of eval/new Function or similar dynamic code-evaluation patterns in source files.
- Good: safeSpawn validates inputs and spawns child processes with shell:false, avoiding shell injection for that API.
- Good: scripts/copy-assets.ts implements explicit path traversal checks (resolved path startsWith absSrcDirWithSep) and skips symlinks; lstat is used to avoid following symlinks.
- Good: generate-markdownlint-config.ts writes to a temp file then renameSync into place (atomic write pattern) and handles existing target by unlink+rename fallback.
- Operational risk: verify script (and project policy) mandates running `npm audit fix --force` automatically. --force can upgrade packages and introduce breaking changes or unexpected dependency versions without human review, increasing supply-chain and regression risk.
- Code pattern risk: multiple test/integration scripts use execSync with interpolated command strings (e.g. ``npx tsx ${scriptPath}``). If those command arguments ever include untrusted input, that could lead to shell/argument injection or incorrect quoting behavior (also fragile on paths with spaces).
- Hardening note: atomic rename is generally safe on POSIX when the temp file is on the same filesystem, but the code currently falls back to unlink+rename on failure; that path could be susceptible to TOCTOU if an attacker can race the target path (symlink attacks). Consider O_EXCL or write-to-new-path-then-rename with secure temp directories.
- Lint/CI hygiene: transient/generated files (tmp/) were being linted and caused many ESLint errors; while ignoring tmp/ is appropriate, ensure any legitimate generated files are stored in git-ignored locations and never executed/imported as source in CI without validation.
- Dependency posture: many tooling dependencies are present (prettier, eslint, vitest, markdownlint-cli2, jiti). Ensure lockfile (package-lock.json) is authoritative in CI and that peer dependencies are documented and installed in consumers. The repo history shows package-lock.json exists but verify CI uses it (npm ci).
- Secrets & data exposure: no secrets, credentials, or tokens are present in tracked files based on the inspected tree. Add a secret-scanning step (pre-commit or CI) as an additional precaution.

**Next Steps:**
- Replace execSync invocations used in scripts/tests with the safeSpawn helper (shell:false and explicit args) wherever feasible; make these changes one file at a time and run verify after each change.
- Remove or limit automatic use of `npm audit fix --force` from regular verify runs; prefer running audit in 'check' mode and gating any automatic fixes to a separate, monitored maintenance pipeline (or require human review before committing audit-driven upgrades).
- Harden atomic writes: when creating temp files use a secure per-run temp directory (fs.mkdtemp) or open with O_CREAT|O_EXCL where possible to avoid TOCTOU/symlink races; document the assumptions and platform-specific behavior (Windows rename semantics).
- Add CI gating to ensure package-lock.json (or lockfile) is used (npm ci) and prevent automated verify runs from mutating lockfiles unattended; require explicit, reviewed dependency upgrades via ADRs for significant upgrades.
- Add a repository-level secret scan (git-secrets, trufflehog, or GitHub secret scanning) and a supply-chain check (dependabot or scheduled npm audit reports) in CI to detect regressions.
- Limit lint ignores: keep tmp/ ignored but ensure any other ignores are narrowly scoped and documented; avoid broad ignores that can mask real issues.
- Add a short security ADR documenting the `npm audit fix --force` policy, trade-offs, and mitigations (e.g., run in ephemeral runner, require snapshot of changes and fast revert plan).

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (90% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Repository is well-managed under version control: critical source, configs and docs are tracked, build artifacts are ignored, ADRs and frequent commits exist. A small number of unstaged modifications and transient generated artifacts remain and should be committed or cleaned up to restore a perfectly clean working tree.
- No evidence of merge conflicts or repository corruption; git status shows a clean tracked/untracked state aside from unstaged changes.
- Critical source files, TypeScript presets, ESLint configs, tests and docs are tracked and present in the repository.
- Good ignore hygiene: dist/, node_modules/, coverage/, and other build artifacts are listed in .gitignore; .voderignore negates dist/ for visibility (expected for this environment).
- Active development is visible: dedicated branches, frequent commits, ADRs, and commits that record metadata and fixes (commit history referenced in provided log).
- The working tree lists ‘Changes not staged for commit’ which indicates a small number of unstaged edits; total untracked files reported as 0 and git-ignored files reported as 7 — well under the massive-uncommitted threshold.
- package-lock.json and other critical metadata are committed and were updated as part of maintenance; tests and verification steps have been run historically.
- Some transient files (tmp/*) were producing lint noise and an .eslintignore entry was recently added to ignore them — this is conservative but should be reviewed to avoid masking real issues.

**Next Steps:**
- Stage and commit or stash any remaining unstaged changes to restore a clean working tree (run git status && git add/commit or git stash).
- Ensure all local commits are pushed to the remote (git push) to avoid collaboration friction and to synchronize CI runs.
- Review the .eslintignore entry for tmp/ to confirm it only excludes truly generated transient artifacts; prefer targeted ignores over broad patterns when possible.
- Run the planned focused lint-and-fix steps from the project plan to eliminate remaining lint warnings and confirm no important source files are unintentionally ignored.
- Continue small, frequent commits and push often to maintain the current strong version control hygiene.
