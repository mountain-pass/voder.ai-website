![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (81.125% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The project is functionally complete and largely verified (builds, tests, exports). However code quality is impacted by duplicated documentation/artifacts and some repository hygiene issues that require consolidation. Addressing duplication and finalizing formatting/verify will raise overall quality above the incomplete threshold.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Consolidate and commit documentation/formatting fixes (refs ADR-0013), run npm run verify until green, then push the branch.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (92% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- The repository implements the requested core features for a configuration package: TypeScript presets, ESLint flat-config layers and a complete export, a TypeScript Prettier config, a Vitest Node factory with Istanbul coverage, markdown-lint abstraction and generation script, testable build scripts, and a comprehensive test suite that validates exports and package integration. Only minor operational/workflow items remain (formatting commits, final verify and push) and a few superficial docs/ADR housekeeping tasks; functionally the package meets the specified requirements.
- ESLint: exports base, dx, performance layers and a `complete` array (default export) that aggregates recommended settings, file globs, test & script globals, and standard ignores.
- TypeScript: provides base/node/library/test presets and JSON tsconfig exports (tsconfig.eslint.json, tsconfig.config.json) accessible via `typescript` exports; jsonLoader resolves source vs compiled paths.
- Prettier: TypeScript `prettier.config.ts` exists and is exported; root `prettier.config.ts` re-exports package config.
- Testing: `createVitestNodeConfig()` factory implemented with Istanbul coverage provider and 80% thresholds; `testSetup.node` path provided; many Vitest suites present validating exports, scripts, and integration packaging.
- Markdown linting: abstraction implemented (getConfig + createCLICommand) and generation script (`scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts`) that writes `.markdownlint.json` atomically; markdownlint-cli2 is declared as peer/dev dependency per ADR.
- Build scripts: `scripts/copy-assets.ts` is testable with exported functions (copyAssets, copyMatchingFiles, formatCLIOutput) and has unit + integration tests following the dual-testing strategy.
- Utilities: safeSpawn, ensureDir, validateRuntimeEnvironment, and json loader utilities implemented and covered by tests.
- Package exports: `package.json` defines dual export strategy including dedicated paths (testing, prettier, eslint, typescript, linters/markdown) and main index; tests exercise both dedicated and main-index import patterns including packing/installation integration tests.
- Coverage & testing strategy: switched to Istanbul provider; tests include coverage-exclusion patterns and use the unit+integration (dual) approach for scripts to meet coverage requirements.
- Remaining operational items: working tree shows formatting and docs edits not yet committed; verify/build should be run to confirm green status in this working tree before push.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the full verify pipeline (npm run verify) in the current working tree and resolve any failures (lint, build, tests, or audit-driven lockfile updates) in focused commits.
- Stage and commit the formatting/markdown fixes currently present in the working tree with messages referencing ADR-0013, then re-run verify to confirm green.
- Ensure `dist/` is produced by build (tsc -p tsconfig.build.json) before running packaging/integration tests that import compiled artifacts; if any package export path points to missing dist files, fix build or exports.
- Push the branch after verify is green and re-run scripts/duplicate-detect.sh to record final duplicate status; append confirmation to ADR-0013 per the planned workflow.
- Optionally review any remaining ADR/documentation TODOs (minor MD033/MD025 in ADR-0013) and finalize those editorial changes as separate small commits.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (30% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- The repository largely implements the project's quality toolchain (ESLint flat-config, Prettier, Vitest, markdownlint, TypeScript presets and a comprehensive verify script). However, substantive duplicated documentation and related clutter were detected (multiple ADR/decision duplicates and consolidation TODOs), which indicates poor organization and triggers the project's duplicate-content quality cap; this plus some residual repository hygiene issues reduces the effective quality score to the low-30s.
- Required quality tools are present and configured: ESLint flat-config layers (eslint/* and eslint/index.ts), Prettier config (prettier.config.ts + src/prettier.config.ts), Vitest factory and many tests (createVitestNodeConfig, vitest.config.ts), markdown linter abstraction (linters/markdown) and package.json 'verify' script that enforces npm audit fix --force → lint:fix → lint:check → lint:md:fix → format → build → test:ci as required by guidance.
- Unit and integration tests are abundant and structured per guidance (dual testing strategy for scripts, many Vitest suites, Istanbul coverage provider configured, coverage thresholds present). Script code has been extracted into testable functions (scripts/copy-assets.ts) and follows the 'main function' + CLI guard pattern with proper istanbul ignores.
- Substantial duplication found in repository documentation: multiple near-duplicate ADR/decision files related to ADR-0013 exist (docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md, docs/decisions/0013-consolidation-todo-20250828T183725Z.md, docs/decisions/0013-duplicate-classification-20250828T000000Z.md and related commit artifacts). The project's Duplicate/Similarity rules mandate applying the duplication cap when any such duplication exists.
- Some tracked docs were modified by formatting and markdown autofix runs and several related temp artifacts/logs are referenced in the working history; while most generated artifacts live in /tmp and are excluded by .gitignore, the presence of multiple ADR variants and consolidation TODO files is active clutter that hurts maintainability.
- Quality enforcement mechanisms exist (verify script, lint scripts, markdownlint scripts). However, pre-commit automation (husky) is present as a dependency but there is no visible committed .husky/ hook configuration in the repo snapshot; CI workflows are intentionally external per project policy, so enforcement relies on developer discipline and 'verify' runs.
- Package exports and TypeScript JSON presets are implemented and tested (typescript/*.json exports, tests that assert exports), and package.json scripts align with the guidance (lint, lint:fix, lint:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix, format, format:check, test:ci, verify).

**Next Steps:**
- Complete ADR-0013 consolidation: pick canonical docs for duplicate groups, merge and remove duplicates, one focused commit per group as prescribed by ADR-0013; run markdownlint-cli2 fix and Prettier after each consolidation and run the verify pipeline.
- Remove or consolidate the multiple ADR/decision TODO/duplicate snapshot files so the repository contains a single canonical ADR document per decision (this directly addresses the major duplication finding and will lift the duplicate-content cap).
- Ensure husky hooks are configured and committed (create .husky/pre-commit to run a lightweight verify or lint:check/format check) to improve local enforcement and reduce reliance on manual runs.
- After deduplication, run the full verify, address any npm audit fix --force fallout in minimal commits, and push changes. Re-run scripts/duplicate-detect.sh and record the results in the canonical ADR as required.
- Consider adding a small 'doc hygiene' checklist in CONTRIBUTING.md that references ADR-0013 so future additions avoid creating duplicate ADRs or duplicate decision snapshots.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (90% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- The repository has a comprehensive, well-designed test suite with many unit and integration tests, an explicit dual testing strategy for scripts, and an Istanbul-based coverage configuration targeting the 80% threshold. Test runs and full verify cycles are reported as successful in recent history, so overall test health is strong, though there are a few operational caveats to re-run verification after outstanding local changes.
- Extensive Vitest suites exist: unit tests, integration (subprocess) tests, export-equivalence tests, package-structure and installation integration tests, and script unit+integration tests.
- Coverage engineering: project deliberately uses Istanbul provider (via @vitest/coverage-istanbul) to enable fine-grained ignores; dual testing strategy (unit + integration) applied to scripts so coverage is measurable.
- There are tests that validate package exports, compiled artifacts under dist/, and package-lock alignment (dependency-alignment.test.ts), demonstrating end-to-end and consumer-oriented verification.
- Project history shows recent full 'npm run verify' and build cycles completed successfully and coverage goals met in prior runs, satisfying the RECENT FULL GREEN RUN criterion.
- Tests include careful patterns for CLI-only code exclusion (/* istanbul ignore if */ / /* istanbul ignore next */) and explicitly test both import and CLI interfaces for scripts.
- Operational caveat: current working tree shows a few modified/un-staged files (docs and a script) from a formatting step — these changes should be verified by re-running the full verify to ensure no regressions before pushing.

**Next Steps:**
- From the current working tree run: npm run verify 2>&1 | tee /tmp/verify-after-format.log to confirm tests and coverage remain green after the formatting edits.
- If verify fails, follow the defined small-fix loop: run the failing step (lint/test/build), make minimal focused changes, commit, and re-run verify until green.
- Ensure dist/ compiled artifacts and package-lock.json are present and up-to-date (build then run tests that assert dist/ files exist).
- Push the branch only after a locally green verify to preserve the recent successful test history for CI and downstream consumers.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (95% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- The project appears to have been built and validated successfully: dist artifacts exist, verify/build/test cycles have run and completed, and tests and audit reports were reported green.
- Multiple successful runs of the full verification pipeline (npm run verify) are recorded in the activity log; audit outputs consistently showed zero vulnerabilities.
- A compiled dist/ directory is present and referenced by tests (tests check for dist/src/prettier.config.js and other compiled artifacts), indicating the build step (tsc + asset copy) has executed.
- Vitest suites and coverage strategies were implemented and exercised; the history indicates targeted and full test runs completed and coverage requirements were met during the verification runs.
- Scripts for asset copying and markdown config generation are implemented and tested (unit + integration). CLI guards and istanbul coverage ignore comments are present to satisfy dual testing strategy.
- package.json exports and peer/devDependency alignment checks exist and were validated; package-lock.json was regenerated and used during verify runs per the history.
- Current working tree has a few modified files (docs and scripts) not yet staged/committed on branch cleanup/security-hardening-20250828T183725Z — these are formatting/markdown changes applied by previous steps and do not indicate failing builds.

**Next Steps:**
- Stage and commit the remaining formatting/markdown fixes (git add -A; git commit) and re-run npm run verify to confirm everything remains green after the working-tree changes.
- If npm audit fix --force (in verify) updates dependencies and causes failures, address each failure with focused small commits and re-run the verify loop until green.
- Run the planned duplicate-detect script and append a short confirmation entry to ADR-0013 as documented in the plan, then push the branch.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (85% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is comprehensive and developer-friendly: clear README, API reference, consumer quickstart, ADRs, usage guides, and markdown lint guidance are present. A few maintenance issues (duplicate ADR artifacts, scattered TODOs, and minor consistency edits) reduce the completeness score.
- Strong README: installation, compatibility, peer-dependencies, examples for Prettier, Vitest, ESLint, and Markdown linting are present and actionable.
- API reference (docs/API.md) exists and documents testing, eslint, prettier, typescript, and markdown exports with expected shapes — helpful for consumers and automated tests.
- Consumer Quickstart (docs/CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md) provides copy/paste steps for tsconfig, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, and npm scripts (including jiti and NODE_OPTIONS guidance).
- Comprehensive ADR set: many decisions (security, coverage, testing strategy, markdown tool choice) are documented in docs/decisions/, supporting governance and traceability for maintainers.
- Markdown linting documentation and scripts are implemented and documented (linters/markdown abstraction, docs/libraries/usage/markdown-lint.md, and scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts).
- Developer-focused docs (CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, CHANGELOG.md) are present and explain verify flows, audits, and contribution expectations.
- Docs for dependency usage (docs/libraries/usage/) are present for key tools (Vitest, eslint-plugin-unicorn, eslint-plugin-import, esbuild) which helps implementers integrate correctly.
- Good dog-fooding: repo includes examples and tests that exercise the documented exports (export-equivalence, package-exports, dist/imports tests), aligning docs with code.
- Maintenance issues: multiple ADR variants and TODO ADR files (duplicate 0013 files) create noise and may confuse readers about canonical decisions.
- Some doc files show minor drift or duplication (e.g., repeated paragraphs in prompts/development-dev-config.md and several 0013 metadata files) that should be consolidated for clarity.
- A few examples reference environment flags (NODE_OPTIONS="--experimental-strip-types") and advanced steps; consider surfacing concise troubleshooting steps where those fail on a developer machine.
- The consumer quickstart and README assume consumers will run npm install with many peer deps; highlighting the minimal required command and confirming exact peer version guidance in one place would reduce friction.

**Next Steps:**
- Consolidate duplicate ADR artifacts (especially the multiple 0013 files) into a single canonical ADR and mark others as superseded to remove confusion.
- Run a pass to remove or resolve placeholder/TODO documents and ensure docs/decisions/ reflects the single source of truth for each decision.
- Add a short 'Minimal Getting Started' snippet that lists the exact minimal install command (peers) and the smallest set of files to drop into a consumer project for fast adoption.
- Add a small Troubleshooting section to README or Consumer Quickstart that covers common issues (jiti missing, NODE_OPTIONS for Prettier, verify failures after npm audit --force) with clear remediation commands.
- Perform a documentation consistency pass (fix duplicated paragraphs, ensure examples match package.json scripts and exports) and run markdownlint/Prettier as part of the doc changes.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (87% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are well-managed and currently appear secure and compatible (peer/dev split, vitest/provider alignment, and an audited lockfile). A small set of version pinning choices and a reliance on `npm audit fix --force` create modest residual risk and maintenance burden.
- Repository has both peerDependencies and devDependencies declared appropriately for tooling (eslint, prettier, typescript, vitest, markdownlint-cli2). This is the correct pattern for a config package.
- Project includes explicit version alignment for vitest and related coverage providers (3.2.4) as required by ADR; this reduces runtime incompatibility risk for tests but creates a coupling that requires coordinated updates.
- An up-to-date lockfile was generated and audit runs in the history reported 0 vulnerabilities; the verify script runs `npm audit fix --force` which enforces a clean audit state in local/CI runs.
- Many dev tools are recent (typescript 5.x, prettier 3.x, eslint 9.x, vitest 3.x). Some packages are pinned/exact (vitest, coverage providers) by design; others use caret ranges which balance currency and compatibility.
- esbuild is present as a devDependency at a version that may be older relative to the current ecosystem; consider verifying compatibility if you rely on esbuild features or security patches.
- Including the same packages in peerDependencies and devDependencies (e.g., @typescript-eslint packages) is intentional for development convenience but means consumers must still install peers; documentation clearly signals that.
- Using `npm audit fix --force` in an automated verify step is a deliberate policy tradeoff: it keeps dependencies current but can introduce breaking upgrades. The repo mitigates this by running lint/build/test after fixes, but it increases the need for vigilant CI monitoring.
- markdownlint-cli2 is selected and documented as a required peer dependency (consistent with ADR-0006); programmatic abstraction avoids direct runtime coupling to the linter in the package code.

**Next Steps:**
- Add periodic automated dependency checks (dependabot/renovate or scheduled `npm audit --json`) to detect regressions and surface breaking upgrades for maintainer review.
- Review and, if possible, update esbuild and other less-frequently-updated tools to their latest non-breaking releases; run full verify to detect any regressions.
- Continue to treat vitest and its coverage provider as a lock-step pair; when upgrading, bundle both together and run the verify pipeline in a dedicated branch (document via ADR as required).
- Consider adding an advisory gating step in CI that alerts (but does not auto-fix) for high/critical vulnerabilities before `npm audit fix --force` runs, to provide an additional human-review checkpoint.
- Periodically run a third-party vulnerability scan (Snyk, GitHub Dependabot alerts, or similar) to complement npm audit and catch issues with indirect supply-chain vectors.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Overall the repository follows many secure development practices (no obvious secret leaks, path traversal checks, atomic file writes, spawn without shell). Remaining security risks are primarily operational/dev-tooling: use of execSync in many places, automatic `npm audit fix --force` in verify, and a few potential filesystem race/symlink edge cases and older dev dependencies.
- Use of execSync: multiple integration/tests/scripts invoke execSync (and npm install/npm pack). execSync runs child processes synchronously and can introduce command-injection or unexpected execution contexts if inputs are not fully controlled. Many tests create temp packages and run npm install which executes lifecycle scripts from tarballs—this is a potential vector for arbitrary code execution in the developer/CI environment if tarball contents are attacker-controlled.
- Mixed subprocess handling: a safeSpawn utility exists that avoids shell execution and collects output, but it is not used consistently across the codebase. Replacing execSync usages with safeSpawn (or otherwise ensuring arguments are validated and no shell is used) would reduce attack surface.
- verify script runs `npm audit fix --force`: while intended to keep deps current, `--force` can upgrade to major versions or change transitive dependencies automatically. Running this automatically in developer or CI environments can introduce breaking changes or unexpected dependency substitutions and may be abused if registry/lockfile policies are not strict. It also makes injected dependency changes a higher-impact vector.
- Dependency version hygiene: some devDependencies appear very old (for example esbuild ^0.25.9 is an old major line) and keeping toolchain dependencies up-to-date is important. Even devDependencies can be an infection vector for local developer environments and CI. Peer/dev dependency ranges and exact pins (some exact versions present) should be reviewed so known-vulnerable versions are not present.
- Filesystem operations and atomic writes: generate-markdownlint-config writes a temp file then renameSync into place (good), but the fallback path that unlinks an existing file before rename introduces a small TOCTOU window where an attacker controlling the directory could race to replace the file or symlink. copy-assets implements path traversal checks (resolve + startsWith with appended sep) and skips symlinks, which is good; however there remain subtle edge cases on platforms with different path semantics.
- Environment propagation: safeSpawn merges provided env with process.env. Passing the full process.env to child processes may leak environment secrets into subprocesses. Tests and scripts also run child processes with env manipulation (e.g., passing NODE_V8_COVERAGE). Consider minimizing env passed to subprocesses and avoid propagating sensitive variables.
- Test-time package installation: tests create a tarball via `npm pack` and then run `npm install` in a temp consumer. While this is a valid integration test, installing local packages executes package lifecycle scripts (preinstall/postinstall), which can execute arbitrary code in the test environment. Ensure these tests run in isolated CI agents, and consider running npm install with restricted flags or using lockfile and integrity checks.
- No secrets in repo: scanning the provided files shows no plaintext secrets, credentials, or API keys in tracked files, which is good.
- Repository settings: package.json is private:true which prevents accidental publish, and .gitignore covers build artifacts. Peer dependency guidance and ADRs indicate attention to supply chain policy (ADR-0007).

**Next Steps:**
- Replace remaining execSync usages with safeSpawn (or otherwise ensure spawn without shell and validated args). Prioritize scripts and tests that run npm install/npm pack or run arbitrary commands.
- Limit or remove `npm audit fix --force` from developer verify script; instead run `npm audit` as a blocking step and perform controlled dependency updates in dedicated change sets. If `--force` must remain in CI, gate it in an isolated job that snapshots changes and runs full verify, and ensure lockfile integrity checks are present.
- Audit and update devDependencies to current, supported versions (esbuild, tsx, prettier, etc.). Run an automated dependency scanner (SCA) and verify no high/critical vulnerabilities exist in the lockfile; keep package-lock.json committed and ensure CI uses it (npm ci).
- Harden file-writing code paths: add unit tests simulating symlink/TOCTOU scenarios for generate-markdownlint-config and copy-assets; where possible, use safer atomic-write helpers and ensure rename operations are performed on same filesystem without following attacker-controlled symlinks.
- Minimize environment propagation to child processes. When invoking subprocesses, construct a minimal env containing only required variables (avoid passing full process.env unless necessary).
- Run integration tests that perform `npm install` in isolated ephemeral CI runners or containers with no network access to untrusted registries, and consider using npm install flags that disable lifecycle scripts when appropriate for test scaffolding.
- Add automated policy checks in CI (or local pre-verify) to detect use of execSync, unconstrained env passing, and direct npm install of non-lockfile artifacts to reduce accidental unsafe patterns.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (90% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Repository is well-managed under version control: critical sources and docs are tracked, ignores are correct, no conflicts, and only a small set of working-tree edits are present.
- Current git status shows 4 modified files (docs/CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md, docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md, docs/decisions/0013-consolidation-todo-20250828T183725Z.md, scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts) and no untracked files — total uncommitted files < 10 (good).
- .gitignore covers node_modules/, dist/, coverage/, build/ and other tool artifacts; .voderignore intentionally negates dist/ for agent visibility — ignore patterns look appropriate for build artifacts and temp files.
- No merge conflicts or repository corruption are reported in the provided status; branch state is clean aside from the unstaged modifications.
- Critical source, config, scripts, tests, and ADRs are tracked (many core files present and under version control), satisfying 'critical files tracked' requirement.
- Remote synchronization state (commits ahead/behind) is not shown in the current status snapshot; history indicates active branching and commits, but the exact number of unpushed commits is unknown.

**Next Steps:**
- Stage and commit the remaining local edits with clear messages referencing ADR-0013 as planned (git add -A; git commit -m "chore(docs): apply formatting auto-fixes after markdown fixes; refs ADR-0013").
- Run the full verify sequence (npm run verify) after committing to ensure lint/build/tests pass before pushing.
- Push the branch to the remote (git push --set-upstream origin HEAD) and confirm no large unpushed commit backlog remains.
- After push, run the duplicate-detect script and append the results to ADR-0013 as planned to close the documentation loop.
- If remote sync status reveals multiple unpushed commits, push immediately and consider squashing small iterative commits if desired for cleaner history; otherwise keep frequent, small commits.
