Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (83.88% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The project is functionally complete and builds/tests successfully, but code quality is held back by documented duplicate content and related consolidation work. Addressing duplication and a few markdown/formatting fixes is required before marking the project complete.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Consolidate duplicate user-facing documentation per ADR-0013 and extract duplicated code into small shared utilities (one change per commit), running npm run verify after each commit.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (95% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- The package implements the required configuration exports, tooling factories, lint/markdown helpers, build scripts, and comprehensive tests; core features (TypeScript presets, ESLint layers including a complete aggregate, Prettier export, Vitest factory using Istanbul, markdownlint abstraction, and testable build scripts) are present and well-covered by unit and integration tests.
- TypeScript presets: base/node/library/test JSON presets exist and are exported via typescript/index.ts and also re-exported from src/index.ts.
- ESLint: base, dx, performance layers implemented and a complete aggregate (complete) is exported and used by root eslint.config.ts as expected.
- Prettier: prettier.config.ts (TS) implementation present and re-exported; src and package exports provide the config for consumers.
- Testing: createVitestNodeConfig() factory exists, config uses provider 'istanbul' and enforces coverage thresholds per ADR.
- Markdown linting: linters/markdown implements getConfig() and createCLICommand(); scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts writes a .markdownlint.json and unit + integration tests validate behavior.
- Build scripts: scripts/copy-assets.ts provides testable functions and CLI wrapper, with unit and integration tests following the dual-testing strategy.
- Exports & packaging: package.json exports map dedicated paths and main index to dist/* artifacts; tests exercise package packing/installation and import resolution (integration smoke/package-exports tests).
- Validation utilities: validateRuntimeEnvironment and jsonLoader are implemented with tests to ensure runtime prerequisites and JSON loading in both source/compiled layouts.
- Coverage and testing strategy: multiple Vitest suites exist including export-equivalence, package-structure, and script coverage units; Istanbul provider enables fine-grained exclusions for CLI-only code.
- Outstanding non-functional items: a user-facing ADR doc (docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md) has remaining markdownlint issues that were autofixed partially and remain modified in the working tree (documentation hygiene, not functional).

**Next Steps:**
- Run the full verify sequence (npm run verify) in the current working tree to confirm nothing regresses and to capture any audit-induced changes.
- Commit or finalize the remaining markdown autofixes (docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md) and re-run lint:md and format to clear working-tree modifications.
- Ensure package-lock.json is present and up-to-date for dependency-alignment tests (dependency-alignment.test.ts reads package-lock.json); if missing, create/regenerate and re-run tests.
- Confirm dist/ artifacts referenced by package.json.exports are present in the build output used by tests (npm run build) and that package packing/integration tests continue to pass in CI consumers.
- Optionally run an end-to-end consumer installation (npm pack + npm install in a temp dir) as executed by tests to validate final published consumer experience before publishing.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (35% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- Code quality tooling and enforcement are present and largely aligned with project guidance (ESLint flat config, Prettier, Vitest, markdownlint, verify script), but documented duplicate/near-duplicate content and related ADR artifacts trigger the project's duplicate-content rule which caps the quality score.
- Duplicate / similar content: Repository contains evidence and ADR work (ADR-0013) documenting duplicate detection runs and multiple related decision files (several 0013 variants). The project guidance mandates that any detected substantial duplication triggers a strict cap — this has been applied.
- Quality tooling: ESLint (flat config layers), Prettier, Vitest, markdownlint-cli2 abstraction, and a 'verify' script (including npm audit fix --force) are configured in package.json as required by guidance.
- Automated enforcement: Project provides npm scripts for lint, lint:md, format, test, and verify; husky is present in devDependencies and was installed per history — build/test/lint enforcement appears implemented via scripts and CI/process notes.
- Coverage policy: Vitest config uses Istanbul provider and enforces coverage thresholds; many Vitest suites exist and coverage strategies follow ADRs (dual testing strategy for scripts).
- Minor hygiene issues: There are multiple ADR/doc files with overlapping content and some markdown lint findings (notably docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md had markdownlint issues before autofix). These are documentation-level maintenance concerns rather than missing tooling.
- No major missing tooling: The absolute rule (missing required quality tooling) does not apply — required tools and configurations are present and used in scripts; runtime validators for required peer tooling (e.g., jiti, tsconfig files) are implemented in utils/validateRuntime.ts.

**Next Steps:**
- Consolidate the duplicate ADR and decision files referenced by ADR-0013 into a single canonical document (small, well-tested commits) to remove the duplicate-content cap.
- Run the repository duplicate-detection script (scripts/duplicate-detect.sh) and address any tracked duplicate groups that are actionable (document exceptions in ADR-0013 if necessary).
- Finish resolving the remaining markdownlint issues in docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md and re-run npm run verify to ensure all quality gates pass.
- Consider a small follow-up to remove or rationalize any redundant decision drafts (the 0013-* variants) to improve maintainability and avoid future duplicate-detection noise.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (90% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- Test suite appears comprehensive and recently ran green in verification cycles; coverage targets are met and a wide range of unit and integration tests exist, though a few environment-sensitive integration tests could be flaky.
- Recent history documents successful non-interactive verify runs (npm run verify) after lockfile regeneration and build fixes, indicating a recent full green test run.
- The repository contains extensive Vitest suites (unit, integration, export-equivalence, package-installation, scripts unit+integration) covering scripts, linters, TypeScript presets, ESLint layers, and Prettier exports.
- Coverage requirements are explicitly enforced (80% thresholds) and history claims coverage goals were met (100% reported in prior runs).
- Tests include dual testing strategy for scripts (unit tests for coverage + subprocess integration tests) which is correct but increases surface for flakiness in different environments.
- Some tests rely on environment details (NODE_V8_COVERAGE, presence of package-lock.json, dist/ compiled artifacts) which can cause brittle failures if the preconditions are not reproducibly set in CI or local runs.
- There are a few skipped or fragile tests (e.g., a skipped validateRuntimeEnvironment case) and recent markdown autofix activity left docs modified (linting changes) — these are orthogonal to core tests but could affect verify ordering if not committed before running verify.

**Next Steps:**
- Run a full local npm run verify now (build, lint, lint:md, format, test:ci) and capture logs to confirm the most recent state remains green after the outstanding docs changes.
- Stabilize environment-sensitive tests: ensure package-lock.json presence, make dist/ artifacts predictable for test imports, and guard NODE_V8_COVERAGE dependent tests to avoid intermittent failures in CI.
- Convert any remaining fragile subprocess-based assertions to use safeSpawn or mocks where feasible to reduce flakiness and improve test determinism.
- Automate the verify sequence in CI to run on each branch push to continuously validate the suite and surface regressions early.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (95% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- The project has been built and validated: builds, unit and integration tests, packaging and verify scripts have run successfully (including audit, lint, format, build and Vitest suites). Only non-execution documentation autofix residue remains; runtime artifacts and export tests indicate the package functions as intended.
- A full non-interactive verify sequence (npm audit fix --force && lint/format/build/test:ci) has been executed historically and reported successful in the project history.
- TypeScript build artifacts (dist/) are present and package.json exports point at ./dist/*; multiple package-structure and dist-import tests exercise packing/installation and passed in recorded runs.
- Vitest suites (many unit and integration tests) were added and run; coverage provider is configured to use Istanbul and coverage/threshold requirements were enforced; history indicates 100% coverage post-refactor for the test suite.
- Scripts used by consumers (generate-markdownlint-config, copy-assets) have unit and integration tests that run successfully; packaging/pack+install tests (npm pack + install in temp consumer) were executed and validated exports.
- Dependency alignment tests (vitest and coverage provider) are present and were executed; package.json and package-lock were regenerated and validated in history.
- Minor remaining non-execution issues: docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md was modified by markdown autofix and remains in working tree (needs staging/commit), and earlier markdownlint reported three issues in that ADR file prior to autofix; these are documentation housekeeping items and do not impair runtime execution.
- The project relies on Node >=22.6.0 for native TypeScript config loading (prettier TypeScript configs) and uses tsx/jiti in scripts; test logs show scripts executed successfully in the project environment.

**Next Steps:**
- Stage and commit the docs autofixes (docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md) and re-run npm run verify to confirm a green pipeline locally.
- Push the verified branch to remote and re-run the duplicate-detection script (scripts/duplicate-detect.sh) as planned to finalize ADR-0013 steps.
- Optionally run a fresh clean CI run (npm ci && npm run verify) in a clean environment to double-check no environment-specific assumptions remain (especially Node version and presence of jiti/tsx).
- After verification, continue small, focused consolidation commits per ADR-0013 and run verify after each change to keep the main branch green.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is comprehensive and well-organized for both consumers and maintainers: README, API reference, consumer quickstart, ADRs, and per-dependency usage docs are present and largely actionable. A few clarity/consistency and formatting issues (duplicate ADR docs, minor markdown lint findings, and small cross‑document inconsistencies) prevent a perfect score.
- README.md: Clear quick-start, installation, examples for TypeScript/ESLint/Prettier/Vitest/Markdown linting and peer-dependency list. Includes troubleshooting and API highlights — good consumer entry point.
- API.md: Concise API reference describing testing, eslint, prettier, typescript, and markdown exports. Useful for consumers to confirm available helpers and shapes.
- docs/CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md: Very practical, step-by-step integration guidance (tsconfig, eslint, prettier, vitest, scripts). Contains executable snippets and peer-dependency guidance (including jiti).
- docs/libraries/usage/: Contains per-dependency usage docs (esbuild, eslint-plugin-import, unicorn, markdown-lint, vitest). These are valuable references for integrators and LLM agents.
- ADR coverage: docs/decisions/ contains many MADR-style ADRs documenting architectural choices (typescript format for prettier, coverage engine, markdown linter choice, duplicate-detect policy, etc.). This is excellent governance documentation.
- Scripts & examples: There are concrete scripts and script usage examples (generate-markdownlint-config, copy-assets) and tests referencing them — good dogfooding and validation via tests.
- Markdown linting & format hygiene: Project provides .markdownlint.json, markdownlint-cli2 integration, and docs on mandatory usage. Recent autofix run indicated a few markdownlint failures in docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md (MD033, MD025) which are outstanding.
- Duplication & housekeeping: ADR-0013 and related files acknowledge duplicate docs and contain TODO/classification entries. There are a few duplicated ADRs and draft files (0013 variants) that reduce clarity for readers.
- Cross-document consistency: Minor inconsistencies exist (Node engine versions referenced in some templates/asset files differ from README requirements), and some internal references in prompts/docs are present (these are intentionally protected but can confuse readers if surfaced).
- Developer workflow notes: Console-first policy, verify script order, and coverage requirements are well documented and enforced — excellent for maintainers and CI validation.

**Next Steps:**
- Resolve the remaining markdownlint issues (docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md) and re-run lint:md:fix to achieve a clean state; commit fixes and run full verify.
- Consolidate and prune ADR duplicate drafts: keep canonical ADRs in docs/decisions/ and remove or mark superseded drafts so consumers/readers see a single authoritative record per decision.
- Harmonize Node.js version references across README, prompt templates, and other docs (README currently states >=22.6.0 while some templates list 18.0.0) to avoid consumer confusion.
- Add a brief 'Developer quick checklist' near the top of README or CONTRIBUTING that explicitly calls out: 'build before running package-exports tests' and when to run npm run build vs using relative imports during development.
- Add a short one-line index in docs/decisions/README.md pointing to the ADRs most relevant to consumers (coverage, markdown linter choice, ESLint/export patterns) to improve discoverability for maintainers and integrators.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Overall dependency posture is strong: package-lock and repeated npm audit runs show zero vulnerabilities, peerDependencies are declared for consumer tooling, and devDependencies are aligned for critical tools (Vitest + coverage provider). A few housekeeping items (an older esbuild pin, mixed exact/caret usage for some vitest coverage packages, and an extra coverage provider present) warrant routine maintenance but do not indicate current security issues.
- Security audits: project history indicates repeated 'npm audit' runs and a saved audit report with total vulnerabilities = 0; verify script includes 'npm audit fix --force' as first step.
- Lockfile & reproducibility: package-lock.json is present and was regenerated; tests (dependency-alignment.test.ts) explicitly validate version alignment for vitest and coverage provider ensuring deterministic test environment.
- Peer dependency management: peerDependencies list required consumer tools (eslint, prettier, typescript, vitest, markdownlint-cli2, jiti, etc.), which is the correct pattern for a configuration package and prevents bundling tooling into runtime.
- DevDependency freshness: many major tools are recent (prettier ^3.x, typescript ^5.9.x, eslint ^9.x, vitest 3.2.4). However, esbuild is pinned to ^0.25.9 which appears older relative to other modern tool versions and should be reviewed for updates.
- Version pinning notes: some coverage-related packages use exact pins in devDependencies (e.g. '@vitest/coverage-istanbul': '3.2.4' and 'vitest': '3.2.4') while peerDependencies use caret ranges; repository contains tests to enforce alignment but mixed pin styles should be consciously documented (ADR already covers alignment expectations).
- Redundancy / extras: both '@vitest/coverage-v8' and '@vitest/coverage-istanbul' appear in devDependencies/peers in different roles; ensure only required provider(s) remain to reduce maintenance surface and transitive risk.
- Operational controls: verify script, audit:ci, and ADRs provide strong governance (automatic audit fix, documented ADR process) which reduces security risk and enforces periodic reviews.

**Next Steps:**
- Schedule a targeted dependency refresh: run 'npm outdated' and update low-level/packager deps (notably esbuild) in a small, tested change; run full verify after updates.
- Consolidate coverage-provider dependencies (decide on istanbul-only vs keep v8) and remove unused coverage packages to reduce maintenance surface; document decision in an ADR if changed.
- Standardize pinning policy: prefer caret ranges for peerDependencies and use lockfile/CI to ensure deterministic installs; where exact pins are required (coverage alignment), document rationale in ADRs and keep tests that enforce alignment.
- Continue periodic automated 'npm audit --json' runs in CI and preserve the machine-readable audit output for post-mortem if issues arise.
- Perform a transitive-deps review (e.g., npm ls <suspicious-package>) after any major updates to catch any new risky transitive packages and address them proactively.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (88% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- Overall the codebase follows secure patterns (no shell-by-default spawning, path traversal checks, atomic writes, explicit validation). Minor risks remain from intermittent use of execSync with interpolated command strings in tests/scripts and the mandated automated `npm audit fix --force` workflow which can unexpectedly change dependency versions during verify; these are operational rather than code-level vulnerabilities.
- Good: child process helper `safeSpawn` uses spawn(..., { shell: false }) and validates inputs, avoiding shell injection for newly written subprocess calls.
- Good: `copy-assets.ts` performs path normalization and a start-with check (absSrcDirWithSep) and skips symbolic links; lstat/isFile checks reduce path traversal and symlink TOCTOU risks.
- Good: `generate-markdownlint-config.ts` writes atomically (temp file then rename), reducing partial-write race conditions.
- Good: scripts minimize CLI-only logic and use Istanbul coverage ignores for untestable blocks (clear separation improves testability and reduces attack surface during testing).
- Issue: several tests and integration helpers invoke `execSync` with interpolated command strings (e.g., `npx tsx ${scriptPath}`), which can be fragile if variables contain unexpected characters; while scriptPath is controlled here, replacing with spawn/argv array would be more robust.
- Issue: `npm audit fix --force` is run automatically in `verify` — while intended to prioritize security, it can upgrade/transitively change packages during development/CI in a non-deterministic way and potentially introduce breaking or malicious versions if registry is compromised. The project has ADRs about registry mirrors which mitigates some risk but CI should pin registries and verify lockfile changes.
- Observation: tests temporarily monkeypatch global require in at least one test (skipped variant). Tests that alter globals can mask runtime assumptions and could hide issues if executed in different environments; however these are test-only changes.
- Observation: file permission preservation in copy-assets (chmod to lst.mode) preserves source modes; ensure destination mode preservation is intended and does not unintentionally create world-writable files in CI (scripts should explicitly validate resulting mode where required).
- Observation: many devDependencies and peerDependencies are declared; a project of this size relies on keeping the lockfile intact. The repository includes a package-lock and ADRs about audits and mirrors which is positive for reproducible installs.

**Next Steps:**
- Replace remaining execSync usage in scripts and tests with safeSpawn (spawn with args array) to avoid shell interpolation and improve argument escaping; do this incrementally and run verify after each change (refer ADR-0014 planning).
- Limit the blast radius of `npm audit fix --force`: ensure CI uses a pinned package-lock.json, enforce registry/mirror configuration in CI, and require that any lockfile changes from audit-fix are reviewed/committed explicitly (do not implicitly accept lockfile changes without review).
- Add a dependency-update gating step: if `npm audit fix --force` modifies package-lock.json in CI, fail the build and surface the diff for human review rather than auto-committing changes.
- Add a lightweight secrets and supply-chain checks in CI (e.g., dependency signature or reproducible install checks) and ensure registry mirrors are enforced per ADR-0007 in contributor and CI environments.
- Consider adding explicit validation after copy-assets to assert destination file permissions (avoid creating overly-permissive modes) and add a test to assert expected mode ranges on POSIX.
- Harden tests that monkeypatch globals by scoping modifications and restoring originals; prefer local mocks or test-specific helpers rather than altering global state.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (92% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- Overall version control hygiene is strong: critical sources and docs are tracked, ignore patterns are correct, and the working tree is nearly clean with a single modified tracked file.
- Working directory shows only 1 modified tracked file (docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md) and 0 untracked files — total uncommitted files = 1 (well under automatic caps).
- .gitignore properly excludes build artifacts (dist/, node_modules/, coverage/, etc.) and .voderignore intentionally reveals dist/ to the agent; ignore patterns look correct.
- Key source files, configs, tests, and ADRs are tracked. There are extensive commits and ADR records indicating active, incremental development.
- No merge conflicts or repository corruption reported in the provided git status; duplicate-detect and verify workflows have been run and fixed as part of the workflow.
- Repository shows signs of regular verification (npm run verify, linting, audit) and intentional small commits tied to ADRs — good discipline for a single‑agent workflow.
- Remote sync (ahead/behind) is not provided in the status snapshot, so no explicit penalty was applied, but this should be verified before pushing.

**Next Steps:**
- Stage and commit the single modified tracked file (git add docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md; git commit -m "docs(adr): apply markdown autofix; refs ADR-0013").
- Run the local verify sequence (npm run verify) and fix any issues that appear before pushing.
- Push the branch to remote immediately after a successful verify (git push --set-upstream origin HEAD) to avoid unpushed-commit accumulation.
- Optionally run `git fetch` and `git status --porcelain -b` to confirm there are no unpushed or behind commits relative to remote and reconcile if needed.
