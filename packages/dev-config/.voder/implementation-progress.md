![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (82.25% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
Overall the project is largely functional, building and testing correctly with comprehensive docs and dependency management. However, code quality is materially impacted by documented duplicated content and needs focused consolidation; security and documentation improvements are also recommended.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Consolidate duplicate docs and refactor duplicated utilities per ADR-0013 (small focused commits), then run full verify (lint, format, build, test) to validate improvements.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (90% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository implements the requested dev-config features (ESLint layers and complete export, TypeScript presets, Prettier config, Vitest factory, markdown linter abstraction, build/test scripts and comprehensive tests). Most public APIs, scripts, and test suites are present and aligned with the documented requirements; only minor implementation cleanup and verification steps remain.
- Core exports implemented: eslint (base, dx, performance, complete), typescript presets (base,node,library,test), testing.createVitestNodeConfig(), and prettier default export.
- Markdown linter abstraction implemented (linters/markdown.getConfig and createCLICommand) matching ADR-0006 and tests exercising it are present.
- Build & packaging pipeline present: tsconfig.build.json, build script (tsc -p ...), copy-assets & generate-markdownlint-config scripts, and package.json scripts including verify and test:ci.
- Comprehensive Vitest test suites exist that exercise export equivalence, package export paths, scripts unit+integration tests, and smoke tests — reflecting the dual testing strategy.
- Istanbul coverage selection is implemented in testing factory (provider: 'istanbul') and vitest config excludes test/config files per ADRs.
- Package.json exports point to dist/ artifacts (consistent with dual-export strategy); build is required before consumers can import runtime JS files referenced in tests.
- Minor discrepancies observed: @vitest/coverage-v8 still appears in devDependencies (leftover) while project favors @vitest/coverage-istanbul per ADR-0009; this is low-risk but worth aligning.
- The copy-assets script filters for eslint/*.js in source; eslint sources are TypeScript (.ts) and are compiled by tsc to dist/eslint/*.js before copy-assets runs in the build step — ensure build order is preserved (currently tsc runs before copy:assets).
- A local unstaged doc change (docs/libraries/usage/vitest.md) exists in working tree; non-functional but should be committed/cleaned to keep verify reproducible.
- Runtime validation utilities (validateRuntimeEnvironment, jsonLoader) and required TypeScript JSON templates (typescript/tsconfig.*.json) are present and used by tests.

**Next Steps:**
- Run a full clean build and verify locally (npm ci / npm run build / npm run test:ci) to confirm all dist paths referenced by tests are generated and tests pass in CI-like environment.
- Remove or rationalize leftover @vitest/coverage-v8 devDependency if not needed; update package.json and regenerate lockfile as per ADR plan.
- Stage and commit the modified docs/libraries/usage/vitest.md change so repository is clean for automated verify and CI runs.
- Consider a quick grep for any other stale coverage-v8 references and align devDependencies/peerDependencies to @vitest/coverage-istanbul for consistency with ADR-0009.
- After the above, run npm run verify to ensure lint, markdown-lint, format, build, and test:ci all pass before pushing dependency-alignment changes.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (35% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Project demonstrates strong tooling (ESLint flat config, Prettier, Vitest, markdownlint, tsconfigs, verify script) and comprehensive tests, but the repository contains documented duplicate-content findings (ADR-0013 / duplicate-detection runs). Per the scoring rules, any detected substantial duplication triggers the 35% maximum cap despite otherwise good quality tooling and enforcement.
- Quality tooling is present and configured: ESLint flat-config layers (eslint/), Prettier (prettier.config.ts), Vitest tests and vitest.config.ts factory, markdown lint abstraction (linters/markdown) and generation script, and TypeScript presets under typescript/.
- package.json includes required scripts (lint, lint:fix, lint:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix, format, format:check, build, test, verify) and the verify pipeline includes the mandated `npm audit fix --force` step.
- Comprehensive test suites exist (many Vitest tests covering scripts, exports, integration/pack tests, and utilities). Dual-testing strategy for scripts (unit + integration) is implemented and tests follow it.
- Exports follow the dual-export strategy; tests verify export-equivalence and package export integration which aligns with project guidance.
- TypeScript configs and ESLint/Prettier usage match the documented consumer patterns (tsconfig extends, eslint flat layers, prettier re-export), showing strong adherence to guidance.
- Automated enforcement: verify script enforces lint/format/build/test; repository history indicates CI/verify workflows were added and used during development.
- Duplicate content: ADR-0013 and duplicate-detection tooling were run and recorded. The project explicitly documents duplicate findings and remediation steps. The scoring rules mandate an immediate CAP when any substantial duplicate content patterns are detected.
- Repository hygiene: no obvious tracked temporary files or editor backups present; .gitignore covers build artifacts and common noise. Scripts and utilities are small, focused, and testable.
- Minor gap: no visible pre-commit hook configuration (e.g., husky) in repository root to enforce checks locally before commits; CI-based enforcement appears present but local commit-time enforcement could be improved.

**Next Steps:**
- Complete ADR-0013 remediation work: consolidate or document canonical copies for user-facing duplicated docs and remove or reclassify truly redundant tracked files to eliminate the duplication trigger for scoring.
- Run the duplicate-detect.sh pipeline regularly (CI job) and prevent tracked duplicates from reappearing; incorporate its output into PR checks.
- Add lightweight local enforcement (pre-commit hooks) to run lint:fix/format and a fast test/validate step to catch problems before pushing.
- After duplicates are resolved, re-evaluate code quality score—tooling and test coverage indicate the project can reach a much higher score once duplication is addressed.
- Consider documenting the duplicate-detection and ADR remediation process in CONTRIBUTING.md so future contributors avoid creating tracked duplicate content.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (90% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- The test suite is comprehensive, includes many unit and integration tests, and a recent full verify (lint/build/tests) completed successfully. Coverage requirements are enforced and tests exercise the package exports, scripts, and config generation. A few brittle/integration tests and subprocess usages present moderate flakiness risk but do not appear to have caused recent failures.
- A recent full local verify run (npm ci + npm run verify) completed successfully per the project history, indicating a recent full green run.
- The repository contains extensive Vitest suites: unit tests for scripts (copy-assets, generate-markdownlint-config), integration/npm-pack tests, export-equivalence, package-structure, and smoke tests.
- Coverage policy (80% across metrics) is enforced and many tests are explicitly designed for coverage (unit + integration dual strategy for scripts).
- There are integration tests that pack/install the package (npm pack, temporary consumer projects) and subprocess-based tests that can be slower and more environment-sensitive.
- Some tests are explicitly brittle or flagged (e.g., NODE_V8_COVERAGE debugging, a skipped jiti-negative test) and rely on environment variables or global require.resolve stubbing—these are potential flakiness sources.
- Dependency- and lockfile-dependent tests (dependency-alignment) require a deterministic package-lock.json; project history shows a lockfile was generated and used for successful verification.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the full verify sequence in CI for the current branch to confirm the green run is reproducible in the CI environment.
- Stabilize brittle tests: convert env-dependent tests to controlled mocks or mark them as manual/optional, and replace global require.resolve mutation with dependency-injection or mocking helpers.
- Reduce reliance on npx in tests by invoking local binaries directly (resolve via node_modules/.bin or package.json scripts) to avoid network fetches and speed up integration tests.
- Add targeted flaky-test detection (retries or quarantined test lists) and schedule periodic full-verify runs to detect regressions early.
- Document and harden subprocess invocations by sanitizing environment variables passed to child processes and limiting test-side effects (use temp dirs and strict cleanup).

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (95% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- Execution validation is successful: local verify (lint, format, build, tests) and packaging/integration steps have been run and passed. Build artifacts (dist/) and lockfile were produced and consumer-installation tests executed, indicating the software runs and builds correctly.
- The project reports a successful local verification run: npm run verify completed (audit, lint:fix, lint:check, lint:md:fix, format, build, test:ci).
- npm ci and deterministic lockfile generation were performed; a package-lock.json was created and used for reproducible installs.
- TypeScript build step completed and produced dist/ artifacts that tests reference (tests check for dist/src/prettier.config.js and other compiled outputs).
- Vitest test suites (unit, integration, smoke, export-equivalence) were exercised; integration tests used npm pack and a temporary consumer project to validate exports.
- Scripts for config generation and asset copying run successfully (generate-markdownlint-config.ts and scripts/copy-assets.ts have unit and integration tests that passed during verify).
- Package export integration tests use real package.json exports and succeeded in prior runs (npm pack -> install -> runtime checks), demonstrating consumer-facing APIs work.
- A small working-tree note: docs/libraries/usage/vitest.md is modified and not staged; this is a documentation change only and does not appear to affect build/test execution.

**Next Steps:**
- On the current branch run a fresh, non-cached verify: rm -rf node_modules dist coverage && npm ci --no-audit --no-fund && npm run verify to re-validate in a clean environment.
- Stage and commit the single modified doc file (or confirm intentional change) so working tree is clean before creating dependency alignment branch.
- Push the branch and run CI to ensure the same verify steps succeed in the CI environment (catch env-specific issues).
- If you plan dependency/alignment changes (deps/align-vitest-coverage), follow the planned non-interactive steps and fail-fast on verification failures; update lockfile only after verify succeeds.
- Optionally run the duplicate-detection report on CI or an isolated runner to ensure no tracked duplicates exist before merging documentation cleanups.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is thorough and well-organized: README, API reference, usage guides, ADRs, and library-specific usage docs are present and mostly complete. A few clarity and workflow gaps remain (minor), and one local doc change is outstanding in the working tree.
- README.md is comprehensive: quick start, installation, compatibility, API snippets, peer-dependency guidance, troubleshooting, and verify/build/test instructions are present.
- API reference (docs/API.md) exists and documents testing, eslint, prettier, typescript, and markdown exports with expected shapes and usage notes.
- Library usage docs under docs/libraries/usage cover key dependencies (esbuild, eslint-plugin-import, unicorn, markdownlint-cli2, vitest) with practical examples and guidance for consumers.
- ADR collection (docs/decisions/) is robust and documents architecture, dependency and testing decisions (including markdownlint selection, Istanbul coverage, dual testing strategy, peer dependency policy). This supports governance and rationale for current configuration.
- Scripts and developer flows are documented (generate-markdownlint-config, copy-assets, verify pipeline) and corresponding documentation links and tests exist to dog-food the flows.
- Markdown linting guidance and a generator script are provided; README and docs/libraries/usage/markdown-lint.md explain usage and package.json script examples for consumers.
- TypeScript presets and tsconfig templates are exposed and documented; tests validate exported JSON presets (tsconfig exports test coverage present).
- Some documentation references advanced Node flags (NODE_OPTIONS="--experimental-strip-types") and jiti requirements — these are present but would benefit from a short, explicit step-by-step note in one place for new contributors.
- There is a modified docs/libraries/usage/vitest.md file in the working tree (git shows it modified) — ensure that change is committed so docs and repo state are consistent.
- A few places reference internal policies (console-first, .voder/history capture). Those are documented but may be unfamiliar to outside consumers; consider a brief 'developer onboarding' pointer in the README that highlights the console-first policy and .voder expectations.

**Next Steps:**
- Commit the outstanding docs change (docs/libraries/usage/vitest.md) so repository docs and working tree are aligned.
- Add a short, explicit 'Developer setup' subsection in README (or a single docs page) that lists the exact initial steps: install peer deps (including jiti), set NODE_OPTIONS for Prettier when needed, and run npm ci / npm run verify — this reduces on-boarding friction.
- Consolidate a small 'Troubleshooting' checklist in README linking to ADRs and common diagnostics (missing jiti, tsconfig issues, audit failures) so users can quickly follow remediation steps without scanning multiple files.
- Consider an authoritative single-line example for ESLint consumer usage that demonstrates the intended 'complete' import pattern (export default complete) to reinforce the one-line target and avoid consumer confusion.
- Verify and surface any small inconsistencies between README, API.md, and docs/libraries/usage pages (e.g., exact Node version requirements, recommended package versions) and harmonize wording where necessary.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are generally well-managed, with explicit peerDependency declarations, an up-to-date lockfile, and ADR-driven exact-version alignment for Vitest coverage. A few developer-only packages are pinned intentionally; one or two dev deps (notably esbuild) warrant review for freshness.
- Peer dependencies declared for consumer-facing tools (eslint, prettier, typescript, vitest, markdownlint-cli2, etc.), which improves consumer clarity and avoids bundling dev tools.
- DevDependencies include exact/aligned versions for vitest and coverage providers (vitest@3.2.4 and @vitest/coverage-istanbul@3.2.4) per ADR-0005/0009 — this is deliberate to avoid peer mismatches.
- A top-level package-lock.json exists (lockfileVersion 3) and the project history indicates npm audit / verify was run successfully, suggesting no outstanding high-severity vulnerabilities at last verification.
- Some devDependencies are pinned to exact versions (e.g., @vitest/coverage-istanbul: "3.2.4", vitest: "3.2.4"); this is acceptable for test-alignment but requires care when performing upgrades.
- There is both @vitest/coverage-istanbul and @vitest/coverage-v8 present in devDependencies; peerDependencies expose istanbul as the canonical provider. Keeping v8 in devDependencies is harmless but could be removed to reduce maintenance surface if not needed.
- Tooling versions are mostly modern (TypeScript ^5.x, ESLint 9.x, Prettier 3.x), but a few packages (e.g., esbuild ^0.25.9 in devDependencies) look unusually old relative to typical recent releases and should be validated for compatibility and security.
- markdownlint-cli2 is correctly specified as a peer dependency in consumer guidance and implemented via an abstraction layer (linters/markdown), which is good for long-term maintainability.
- The repository follows ADR and governance policies around dependency changes (ADRs required for new direct dependencies), which improves change traceability and reduces accidental risky upgrades.

**Next Steps:**
- Run a fresh npm audit and supply-chain scan (npm ci then npm audit --audit-level=high) to confirm current state and capture machine-readable results (/tmp/npm-audit.json) before making upgrades.
- Review and consider upgrading or validating esbuild (^0.25.9) against current releases and compatibility matrix; if the pinned version is intentional, document reasoning in an ADR.
- If @vitest/coverage-v8 is not required for local experimentation, remove it from devDependencies to reduce maintenance or document its purpose in ADR-0005/0009.
- Establish a periodic dependency review (Dependabot/Renovate) configured to open PRs for non-breaking updates and require the existing `npm run verify` pipeline to pass before merging.
- Before any mass upgrades, regenerate lockfile (`npm install --package-lock-only`) in a feature branch and run the full verify sequence (lint, build, tests) to detect breakages early.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (78% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Overall security posture is good for a configuration package: explicit peer/dev dependencies, committed lockfile, ADRs addressing supply-chain policy, and tests that use temporary directories. The main concerns are supply-chain exposure via an outdated esbuild devDependency, the project-wide practice of automatically running `npm audit fix --force` in verify (operational risk), and multiple uses of child_process.execSync/npx with inherited environment variables (potential for secret leakage or command-injection when inputs are not strictly controlled).
- Committed package-lock.json and explicit peerDependencies reduce runtime dependency ambiguity — positive for supply-chain hygiene.
- Project enforces `npm audit fix --force` in the verify script. While this reduces reported vulnerabilities, the forced auto-fix can introduce breaking changes and unintentionally pull in upgrades that change behavior or create transient security gaps. It also masks audit results in CI unless audit logs are captured separately.
- DevDependency `esbuild` is pinned to a very old range (^0.25.9) which historically had multiple security advisories. Older build tooling in devDependencies can be a supply-chain risk for contributors and CI unless isolated and regularly audited/updated.
- Multiple tests and scripts spawn subprocesses via `execSync` (and `npx`) and pass `process.env` through. These patterns can expose secrets or cause inconsistent behavior if environment variables are not sanitized. Using `npx` in tests can also trigger network lookups if a binary isn't present locally.
- Scripts write configuration files into the current working directory (e.g. `.markdownlint.json`) and run `npm pack`/`npm install` in temporary consumers. This is expected behavior but requires careful sandboxing and should avoid running on untrusted input/paths to prevent accidental overwrites or code execution.
- Some tests temporarily override or mock module resolution (e.g., `require.resolve`), which is flagged/skipped in one case. Care should be taken to avoid altering global resolver behavior in ways that could hide supply-chain problems or create false positives/negatives during automated validation.
- Use of `NODE_OPTIONS="--experimental-strip-types"` in scripts (Prettier) relies on an experimental Node flag; this is operationally acceptable but should be constrained to developer/CI environments matching the documented Node versions to avoid inconsistent behavior.
- Good: `.gitignore` prevents committing build artifacts and `.voderignore` allows LLM inspection without leaking artifacts to VCS. Project adheres to console-first policy (no diagnostic files committed).
- Good: ADRs and documentation (ADR-0007, ADR-0009, ADR-0010, etc.) show conscious supply-chain and coverage engine decisions — helpful for auditing and for establishing policies when upgrading dependencies.

**Next Steps:**
- Perform a focused dependency SCA scan (e.g., Snyk, GitHub Dependabot, or npm audit) against the committed package-lock.json and treat devDependency advisories as actionable items; immediately investigate esbuild (^0.25.9) and upgrade to a supported, patched release if feasible.
- Replace `npm audit fix --force` in the normal local `verify` flow with a controlled remediation workflow: capture audit output to logs, surface findings, and require a dedicated dependency-upgrade commit/branch with regression tests rather than forcing in-place fixes. (Preserve the ADR that mandates audits but change the auto-fix practice.)
- Limit use of `execSync`/`npx` in tests and scripts where possible. Prefer direct invocation of local binaries (node_modules/.bin or programmatic APIs), spawnFile/execFile with args array, and explicit environment whitelisting to avoid shell injection and secret propagation.
- Sanitize environment passed to subprocesses in tests and scripts (whitelist known variables or pass a curated env object). Avoid blindly forwarding `process.env` into child processes in CI and tests.
- Add CI SCA and lockfile integrity checks that fail builds on high/critical advisories and verify `package-lock.json` authenticity (tooling like `npm ci --prefer-offline` + lockfile checks).
- Pin critical tooling (build/test/coverage provider) to exact versions in devDependencies and ensure peer/dev version alignment via automated tests (there are already tests checking vitest/provider alignment — keep and extend these).
- Introduce a minimal security checklist in CONTRIBUTING.md: node engine requirements, how to run local SCA, how to test dependency upgrades, and guidelines for modifying verify/audit behavior.
- Consider adding an `engines.node` field in package.json to enforce the minimal Node.js version required for features (reduces risk of running experimental flags on unsupported runtimes).

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (94% ± 9% COMPLETE)
- Version control is healthy: only one unstaged modification, no untracked files, proper ignore patterns, and no conflicts detected. Commit and push the small change to keep history synchronized.
- Working directory has a single unstaged modification: docs/libraries/usage/vitest.md (no other modified, staged, or untracked files).
- No untracked files reported and 7 sensible git-ignored patterns (node_modules/, dist/, coverage/, tmp/, etc.) — ignore rules appear correctly configured for build artifacts.
- No merge conflicts or repository corruption reported in git status output; repository appears consistent and usable.
- Critical source, config, and docs are tracked. A top-level package-lock.json is present per repository history, and previous verify/build/test runs were executed successfully.
- Branch is 'cleanup/dup-docs-and-utils' with one local modification; git status does not show a backlog of unpushed commits in the provided snapshot.

**Next Steps:**
- Stage and commit the modified file (git add docs/libraries/usage/vitest.md; git commit -m "docs: update vitest usage wording") and push the branch to remote.
- Run the project's verify sequence (npm run verify) locally before pushing to ensure lint/format/build/test pass.
- Keep working changes small and commit frequently to avoid accumulation; ensure branches are pushed promptly to maintain collaboration hygiene.
