![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (82.375% ± 12% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The project is largely functional, well-tested, and executable with strong documentation and dependency hygiene. However code quality is the primary blocker (substantial duplicated content and redundant artifacts per ADR-0013), which prevents an overall COMPLETE rating. Addressing duplication and small housekeeping will raise the overall quality to the desired threshold.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Consolidate and commit ADR-0013 canonicalization (remove untracked duplicate-detect JS variants, merge duplicate docs) and re-run the full verify pipeline.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (92% ± 17% COMPLETE)
- The package implements the requested dev-config features (TypeScript presets, ESLint flat-config layers and a complete export, Prettier TS config, Vitest testing factory with Istanbul coverage, markdown-linter abstraction, export paths, build scripts and comprehensive tests). Most consumer-facing requirements are present and exercised by tests and build outputs.
- TypeScript presets are exported and accessible (typescript/* JSON exports and runtime index present).
- ESLint provides base/dx/performance layers and a complete flat-config that includes file patterns, test and script globals; root eslint.config.ts uses the package export as intended.
- Prettier is provided as a TypeScript config (prettier.config.ts) and exported; src and compiled dist artifacts exist and tests assert expected properties.
- Testing: createVitestNodeConfig() factory implemented; vitest config uses Istanbul provider and coverage thresholds are enforced in tests; many Vitest suites exist and historically report high coverage.
- Markdown lint abstraction (getConfig / createCLICommand) implemented and documented; package.json declares markdownlint-cli2 as a peerDependency.
- Build scripts and utilities (copy-assets, generate-markdownlint-config, safeSpawn, ensureDir, jsonLoader) are implemented with unit + integration tests following the dual-testing strategy.
- Package.json exports point to dist artifacts and types; tsconfig build files and runtime validation utilities are present to support consumer usage.
- Repository contains ADRs and decision docs required by governance; docs include consumer quickstart and libraries/usage documentation.
- Minor operational items visible but not blocking functionality: there are two untracked ADR todo/classification files and planned cleanup steps (duplicate-detection JS variants removed/untracked).

**Next Steps:**
- Run a fresh npm run verify locally to reconfirm all checks (lint, md-lint, format, build, test:ci) in the current working tree before pushing.
- Commit the two untracked ADR docs or incorporate them into ADR-0013 as a small, focused commit so repository state is clean.
- Execute the planned removal of any remaining untracked duplicate-detect JS files (rm -f scripts/duplicate-detect.js scripts/duplicate-detect.cjs) and commit the canonicalization per ADR-0013.
- After verify is green, push the branch upstream and run CI to confirm no environment-specific failures.
- Optional: run a targeted review of consumer-facing examples (CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md and docs/libraries/usage) to ensure no mismatches between export paths and runtime expectations for consumers.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (30% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Strong adherence to the project's quality tooling and enforcement (ESLint flat config, Prettier, Vitest with Istanbul, markdownlint, verify script with npm audit fix), but repository contains documented duplicate/near-duplicate content in decision/docs files and some redundant artifacts which triggers the project’s duplicate-content quality cap, substantially limiting the score.
- Tooling & enforcement: package.json exposes required scripts (lint, lint:fix, lint:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix, format, verify) and verify includes `npm audit fix --force` as required by guidance.
- ESLint: flat-config layers implemented (eslint/base.ts, eslint/dx.ts, eslint/performance.ts) and exported as `complete`; consumer-facing root eslint.config.ts is the simple `export { complete as default } from '@voder/dev-config/eslint';` pattern required by guidance.
- Prettier: TypeScript prettier.config.ts present and exported via src/prettier.config.ts; format and format:check scripts use NODE_OPTIONS for TypeScript configs per ADR-0004.
- Testing & coverage: Vitest configuration factory (createVitestNodeConfig) exists and uses the Istanbul provider per ADR-0009; many unit and integration tests present; coverage-focused patterns (dual testing strategy) implemented.
- Markdown linting: linters/markdown provides getConfig() and createCLICommand(); scripts/generate-markdownlint-config writes .markdownlint.json atomically; docs/decisions confirm markdownlint-cli2 choice and peer dependency guidance is present.
- Automated checks: verify script ties linting/formatting/build/tests together; package exports and dist artifacts are validated by tests (package-structure, dist-imports), indicating enforcement in test suite and build.
- Duplicate content issue (hard cap trigger): multiple near-duplicate ADR/doc files exist (several ADR-0013 variants and related consolidation files). The project's own rules treat any substantial duplication as an immediate quality cap (max 35%).
- Redundant/unnecessary files: there are a few untracked/redundant items and multiple ADR variants (consolidation-todo, duplicate-classification, cleanup doc) that increase maintenance burden and suggest incomplete consolidation work.
- Project guidance mostly followed: TypeScript strict mode, ESM modules, exported tsconfig templates, and required peerDependencies are present and tests exist to validate them—this offsets many other concerns but duplication remains the dominant issue.

**Next Steps:**
- Consolidate duplicate ADR/doc files (merge 0013 variants into a single canonical ADR) in focused commits, run `npm run lint:md:fix` and `npm run format`, then run full `npm run verify`.
- Remove or properly ignore any redundant/untracked helper scripts (e.g., legacy duplicate-detect JS variants) and commit the canonical choice, referencing ADR-0013 per the repository policy.
- Re-run repository-wide duplicate-detection and include the report in ADR-0013 (console-first output saved to /tmp) to demonstrate the cleanup.
- After consolidation, re-run the full verify pipeline to ensure no regressions; address any minor style/test failures in small commits.
- Consider adding a small CI/automation check (periodic run of scripts/duplicate-detect.sh) to prevent duplicate-doc regressions in future and document the approach in ADR-0013 follow-ups.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (95% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The repository has a comprehensive Vitest test suite (unit + integration), a documented dual testing strategy, and historical full green verify runs with 100% coverage reported. Tests exercise exports, scripts, packaging, and config generation; only environment-dependent risks remain.
- Extensive Vitest suite present (~30+ test files covering unit, integration, smoke, export-equivalence, packaging and script tests).
- Dual testing strategy implemented for scripts (unit tests for coverage + subprocess integration tests for E2E validation).
- Coverage engine configured to Istanbul with enforced thresholds (80%); project history reports 100% coverage and many tests exercising coverage-critical code paths.
- Package export and packaging integration tests (npm pack + temporary consumer) validate real consumer experience and compiled dist artifacts.
- Recent project history documents successful `npm run verify` and build cycles; verify order includes `npm audit fix --force`, linting, format, build, and test:ci.
- Some tests have environment dependencies (Node >=22.6.0 for TS config loading, jiti, file-system operations, and `npm pack`), which require correct CI/host configuration to be reproducible.
- There is at least one intentionally skipped test (validateRuntime jiti-resolution case), showing test authors handle non-deterministic scenarios; some integration tests are relatively heavyweight and may slow CI.
- Overall test coverage and scope are excellent and well-aligned with project goals (exports, scripts, linters, config generation).

**Next Steps:**
- Run `npm run verify` locally/CI on the current branch to reproduce the most recent full green run and capture logs into /tmp for auditability.
- Ensure CI runners use Node >=22.6.0 and install peer dependencies like `jiti` so environment-dependent tests consistently pass.
- Consider marking very heavy integration tests (pack/install) with longer timeouts or as optional matrix jobs to reduce flakiness and speed feedback for common PRs.
- Add or confirm a nightly CI job that runs the full `verify` pipeline to detect regressions early and maintain the "recent full green run" status.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (95% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- The repository builds and tests have been exercised and report success: the TypeScript build produced dist artifacts matching package.json exports, the verify pipeline has been run and completed, and Vitest suites (including package-export and smoke tests) were added and reported passing with coverage. Only minor housekeeping (two untracked ADR docs and removal of untracked duplicate-detect JS variants) remains and does not block runtime functionality.
- npm build/verify pipeline has been executed previously and reported successful completion (build produced dist/ with JS and .d.ts matching package.json exports).
- Vitest test suites are comprehensive and were reported to reach 100% coverage in the history; tests include unit + integration patterns (scripts unit tests and CLI integration tests).
- package.json exports point at ./dist artifacts and package-structure/package-exports tests verify those exports are present and functional.
- Scripts implemented as testable functions (copy-assets, generate-markdownlint-config) are covered by both unit and integration tests and include CLI guards and istanbul ignores per policy.
- Markdown linter abstraction (linters/markdown) is implemented and generator script correctly writes .markdownlint.json; scripts exist to regenerate and tests verify output.
- Dependency alignment test requires package-lock.json; a lockfile was regenerated and verification runs succeeded after fixes.
- Current git working tree has two untracked decision files (docs/decisions/0013-*) and previously-discussed untracked duplicate-detect JS variants remain to be removed from disk—these are housekeeping items and not runtime failures.
- A previously-observed verify failure caused by build-order/import timing was fixed as recorded in the history; no remaining critical runtime errors are reported.

**Next Steps:**
- Run a fresh, local `npm ci && npm run verify` to reproduce the green verification in your environment and capture logs to /tmp as the console-first policy requires.
- Perform the planned NOW action: remove the two untracked duplicate-detect JS files (rm -f scripts/duplicate-detect.js scripts/duplicate-detect.cjs) and commit the canonicalization per the documented plan.
- Add and commit the two ADR files (if they are intended to be tracked) or move them to the canonical ADR location; then re-run `npm run lint:md:fix` and `npm run format` and commit any automated fixes.
- Once local verify is green, push the branch upstream and record push logs; if verify fails, iterate with small focused fixes as described in the project plan.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (88% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Documentation coverage is strong: README, API reference, consumer quickstart, ADRs, and per-dependency usage guides are present and practical. A few inconsistencies and duplicate fragments reduce clarity and warrant consolidation per ADR-0013.
- README.md is comprehensive: quickstart, install instructions, peerDeps list, usage examples (tsconfig, eslint, prettier, vitest, markdown). It documents jiti requirement and NODE_OPTIONS usage for TypeScript config files.
- docs/API.md provides a concise reference for main exports (testing, eslint layers, prettier, typescript, markdown). This helps consumers programmatically discover available helpers.
- Consumer Quickstart (docs/CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md) contains copy/paste-ready snippets for tsconfig, eslint, prettier, vitest, and package.json scripts — very useful for adoption.
- docs/libraries/usage/ contains targeted dependency usage docs (esbuild, eslint-plugin-import, unicorn, vitest, markdown-lint) which are helpful for integrators and LLM agents.
- Comprehensive ADRs under docs/decisions/ document governance and technical rationale (supply-chain, coverage engine, markdown tool choice, testing strategy). This is valuable for maintainers and auditability.
- linters/markdown implementation and scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts are documented and tested; docs/libraries/usage/markdown-lint.md clearly explains generation and CLI usage.
- Prettier and Vitest configuration guidance (TypeScript prettier.config.ts, createVitestNodeConfig) is present and aligned with package implementation; coverage provider and thresholds are documented.
- There is some duplicated and slightly messy documentation (multiple near-duplicate ADR drafts and TODO files in docs/decisions/), which the repository already tracks (ADR-0013) and plans to consolidate.
- A notable inconsistency exists: docs/decisions/0003 (adopting classic ESLint extends) conflicts with the rest of the repo which uses ESLint v9 flat config and exports flat-config layers. This could confuse consumers and should be reconciled.
- Some user-facing checks assume consumers will import compiled files under dist/ (package.json exports) — docs explain this, but consumers must be aware to install peer deps (jiti, eslint plugins). The guidance is present but should be emphasized in one short 'Prerequisites' block.

**Next Steps:**
- Consolidate duplicated documentation and remove or merge the provisional ADR drafts as planned under ADR-0013 so consumers see a single authoritative source for each topic.
- Resolve the ESLint guidance inconsistency: either update ADR-0003 to reflect flat-config usage or add a short note in README/docs/decisions explaining why the flat-config approach supersedes that ADR to avoid confusion.
- Add a short, prominent 'Prerequisites & Troubleshooting' section in README (or top of Consumer Quickstart) that highlights Node >=22.6.0, jiti installation, and the NODE_OPTIONS flags required for TypeScript config files so consumers hit fewer surprises.
- Run markdownlint and Prettier over docs after consolidation (the repo already has scripts) and commit the auto-fixes to ensure uniform formatting and remove minor wording/typo issues.
- Verify API.md and the examples are kept in sync with package.json exports (after build); consider a short note in API.md linking to the package export paths and explaining the consumer pattern (dedicated paths vs main index).

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Dependency posture is strong: lockfile present, verify script enforces npm audit, and historical npm audit runs report zero vulnerabilities. Package uses appropriate peerDependency declarations and deliberate version alignment for Vitest/coverage providers. A few devDeps (notably esbuild) look potentially dated and should be checked/upgraded regularly.
- Security: Project history shows npm audit runs and a regenerated lockfile with reported 0 vulnerabilities; verify script includes `npm audit fix --force` as a first step which enforces continuous remediation.
- Lockfile & reproducibility: package-lock.json is present and used in tests, improving reproducible installs; dev/test flows pack/install the tarball for integration tests, which exercises the actual lockfile-resolved tree.
- Peer dependency management: Consumer-facing tools (eslint, prettier, typescript, vitest, markdownlint-cli2, etc.) are declared as peerDependencies, which is correct for a configuration package.
- Deliberate pinning: Vitest and related coverage providers are pinned/aligned (3.2.4) per ADR-0005 to avoid peer-version incompatibilities — this is intentional and appropriate for test stability.
- DevDependencies currency: Most tooling (eslint 9.x, prettier 3.x, typescript ^5.x) uses modern ranges; however `esbuild` is at `^0.25.9` in devDependencies which appears older than typical current releases and should be reviewed for updates.
- Mixed exact and caret ranges: A pragmatic mixture exists (exact pins for vitest provider alignment, caret ranges for other peers) — acceptable when documented and tested, but requires vigilance to avoid transitive conflicts.
- Redundant coverage providers: Both `@vitest/coverage-istanbul` and `@vitest/coverage-v8` appear in devDependencies; docs/ADRs state Istanbul is chosen. Keeping the V8 provider may be intentional for fallback/testing but should be documented to avoid confusion.
- Automation & policy risks: `npm audit fix --force` is aggressive and can introduce breaking updates; the repo mitigates this by immediately running lint/build/test in verify, but this policy requires continued investment in tests to catch regressions early.

**Next Steps:**
- Run `npm outdated` and evaluate upgrades for devDependencies (start with esbuild) in a small, tested PR; prioritize dependency upgrades that fix vulnerabilities or improve compatibility.
- Document rationale for keeping both `@vitest/coverage-v8` and `@vitest/coverage-istanbul` (if intentional), or remove the unused provider to reduce surface area.
- Schedule periodic dependency refresh cadence (dependabot or cron job) and ensure the verify pipeline runs after each upgrade to catch breaking changes early.
- Consider running `npm audit` in CI without `--force` occasionally to surface potential breaking fixes before auto-applying them, and record any forced-fixes in the change log/ADR if they cause test failures.
- Add a short automation test that validates peerDependency compatibility (e.g., install consumer tool versions listed in peerDependencies into a temp project) to catch integration issues proactively.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (76% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Overall the codebase shows generally sound secure patterns for a development-configuration package (no obvious secret leakage or high-risk telemetry). Notable strengths include path-traversal checks, atomic file writes, a safeSpawn implementation (no shell), and limited attack surface (private package). Remaining risks are operational (dependency handling, use of execSync, environment merging) and should be addressed with a few targeted mitigations.
- Good: copy-assets.copyMatchingFiles includes path traversal checks (resolved path startsWith source dir) and skips symlinks, reducing file traversal risk.
- Good: generate-markdownlint-config writes atomically to a temp file then rename, reducing partial-write race conditions.
- Good: safeSpawn uses spawn with shell:false and validates arguments synchronously, avoiding shell injection when used correctly.
- Issue: many tests and scripts use execSync with interpolated command strings (e.g. `npx tsx ${scriptPath}` and `execSync('npm pack')`). If untrusted data ever flows into those strings this could allow command injection; currently usage appears to be with repo-local trusted paths but is a fragile pattern.
- Issue: several places still call execSync directly (tests and integration helpers). These calls inherit process.env and may execute scripts or binaries; they can lead to privilege or supply-chain issues if run in hostile environments or with manipulated PATH.
- Issue: verify script mandates `npm audit fix --force`. While it enforces zero-vuln state, `--force` can upgrade transitive dependencies to breaking versions automatically and mask root-cause issues; it also runs network operations during CI that can change dependency graph nondeterministically unless lockfile is strictly enforced.
- Issue: safeSpawn merges provided opts.env into process.env without sanitization. This allows callers to override PATH, LD_PRELOAD, NODE_OPTIONS, or other sensitive env vars when launching subprocesses; recommend sanitizing or documenting allowed env overrides.
- Issue: tests perform `npm install` in ephemeral directories and execute installed package code (npm install may run lifecycle scripts). Running installs of arbitrary tarballs without disabling lifecycle scripts is a supply-chain risk; the current flow uses local tarball of this repo but is a pattern to harden.
- Issue: validateRuntimeEnvironment uses `require.resolve('jiti')` from ESM context; relying on require.resolve behavior across environments may create unexpected failures but is low-security-risk; ensure behavior is consistent in CI nodes.
- Observation: package.json marks the package private and many dev deps are pinned reasonably; however frequent automatic audit-fix and broad peer dependency ranges could lead to unexpected version skew—consider stricter pinning for critical tools.

**Next Steps:**
- Replace remaining execSync invocations used for operational tasks with safeSpawn or a wrapper that validates inputs and disallows shell interpolation; where execSync is retained for tests document and isolate it.
- Sanitize environment merging in safeSpawn (explicit allowlist of env keys or drop sensitive vars like PATH, LD_PRELOAD, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, NODE_OPTIONS by default) or add an explicit opts.safeEnv parameter.
- Harden dependency workflow: require a committed lockfile for CI installs (use npm ci) and avoid `npm audit fix --force` in automated pipelines without a manual review step; instead surface audit results and triage upgrades in discrete PRs or apply scripted but reviewed updates.
- Add SCA tooling (Dependabot/renovate + Snyk or OSS security scanner) and configure alerts; add periodic reproducible SCA scans in CI and enforce lockfile verification before verify runs.
- When packing/installing the package for integration tests, set npm install flags to disable lifecycle scripts (e.g., `--ignore-scripts`) or assert the tarball is local and trusted; document this test assumption explicitly.
- Add unit tests and code-review checks ensuring any new scripts that accept external paths validate and canonicalize inputs; add a linter rule or checklist to avoid unchecked execSync usages in future commits.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (95% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- Version control is healthy: working tree is essentially clean (only 2 untracked files), critical sources and configs are tracked, ignores are correct, and there are no conflicts reported. Small, actionable housekeeping remains (commit the two untracked docs).
- Total uncommitted files (staged + unstaged + untracked) = 2 (well under the 10-file threshold).
- No modified tracked files are listed as changed/unstaged; only two untracked decision-doc files are present.
- Tracked files count and project structure appear correct: source, configs, scripts, and tests are tracked.
- .gitignore contains standard entries (dist/, node_modules/, coverage/, tmp, logs etc.) so build artifacts and deps are properly excluded.
- No merge conflicts or repository corruption are reported by git status; current branch is 'cleanup/security-hardening-20250828T183725Z'.
- History indicates active, incremental commits and prior successful verify/build runs; no evidence of many unpushed commits in the provided status.
- Two untracked files: docs/decisions/0013-consolidation-todo-20250828T183725Z.md and docs/decisions/0013-duplicate-classification-20250828T000000Z.md — likely in-progress ADR work that should be committed or intentionally ignored.

**Next Steps:**
- Decide whether the two untracked docs should be committed; if so: git add docs/decisions/0013-* && git commit -m "docs(adr): add consolidation artifacts; refs ADR-0013"
- Run the project's verify pipeline (npm run verify) after committing to ensure no auto-fix or formatting surprises before pushing.
- Push the branch (git push) once verify is green to avoid accumulating unpushed commits.
- If the two files are temporary, either remove them or add an appropriate .gitignore entry (and document the reason) to avoid future untracked noise.
