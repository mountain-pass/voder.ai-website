![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (79.38% ± 9% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The project is functionally complete and well-documented with a strong test suite and working build pipeline, but code quality problems (duplication, lingering lint warnings, and minor repository clutter) significantly reduce overall quality. Addressing lint autofix commits, consolidating duplicated docs, and remediating small security and execSync usage concerns will allow a full verification run and raise the overall score.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Commit the remaining eslint/autofix changes and re-run `npm run verify` to produce a recent full green verification run.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (94% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Core functionality is implemented and exercised by comprehensive tests: TypeScript presets, ESLint layers (including a consumable 'complete' export), Prettier TypeScript config, Vitest factory (Istanbul coverage), markdown lint abstraction + generator, and build/copy scripts are present and integrated. A few lint warnings and unstaged edits remain but do not block feature completeness.
- Public API and dual-export strategy implemented and tested: main index and dedicated paths exist and export the expected items (testing, eslint, typescript, prettier, linters).
- TypeScript presets (base/node/library/test) are present in typescript/*.json and programmatically loadable via typescript/index.ts; tsconfig esling/config JSON templates are provided and exported.
- ESLint flat-config layers (base, dx, performance) are implemented and aggregated into a consumable `complete` export that includes ignore rules and file globs; root consumer pattern `export { complete as default } from '@voder/dev-config/eslint'` is supported.
- Prettier config is authored in TypeScript (prettier.config.ts) and exported; package scripts use NODE_OPTIONS to support TypeScript configs per ADR.
- Vitest testing factory createVitestNodeConfig() implemented with Istanbul coverage provider and 80% thresholds; devDependencies include coverage-istanbul and versions are aligned as required by ADRs.
- Markdown linting abstraction implemented (getConfig + createCLICommand) and generator script creates .markdownlint.json atomically; `markdownlint-cli2` is declared as a peer dependency and CLI scripts exist.
- Build & distribution: tsc build and asset-copying scripts exist (copy-assets.ts) and tests validate dist artifact existence and package.json exports; package.json `verify` includes `npm audit fix --force` in the required order.
- Scripts and CLI utilities follow the dual-testing strategy (unit tests for coverage + integration tests for CLI) and use Istanbul coverage exclusions where appropriate.
- Comprehensive Vitest test suites exercise export equivalence, package exports, smoke tests, script units, and integration scenarios—including packing and using the package from a temporary consumer project.
- Outstanding housekeeping: three modified source files (scripts/copy-assets.ts, scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts, src/utils/safe-spawn.ts) show minor lint warnings (unused symbols) after ESLint autofix; these are quality issues but do not break functionality.

**Next Steps:**
- Address remaining lint warnings (prefix intentionally-unused variables with `_`, remove unused imports/vars) and commit the focused fixes to restore a clean lint:check state.
- Run full `npm run verify` locally after committing lint fixes and any autofix/format commits to ensure build, tests, and coverage remain green.
- Commit the three modified files if they are intended changes; ensure no transient .voder/tmp/generated files remain staged or committed.
- Optional: run the duplicate-detection script and append a short confirmation to ADR-0013 as planned once the repo is lint-clean and verify succeeds.
- Consider replacing any remaining execSync usages incrementally with safeSpawn in subsequent small refactors (with tests) to improve robustness.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (28% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Quality tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, markdownlint) is present and configured, but the repository shows evidence of duplicated/near-duplicate documentation files and leftover minor lint warnings; these duplication issues force a strong quality cap despite otherwise good tooling.
- Substantial duplication patterns detected in decision/ADR files (multiple 0013 variants and consolidation TODOs) and related documentation; per project rules any detected duplicate content forces a severe quality cap.
- Project includes the required quality tools and scripts (eslint, prettier, vitest, markdownlint-cli2, verify script with `npm audit fix --force`), and test coverage tooling is configured (Istanbul provider).
- There are remaining lint warnings in source files (scripts/copy-assets.ts, scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts, src/utils/safe-spawn.ts) reported after eslint --fix; some unused variables/params require minimal edits (prefix with `_` or remove).
- Temporary and intermediate artifacts /tmp logs and multiple ADR draft files are present in the repository tree (some intentionally preserved for ADR workflows) and contribute to clutter; while many are in /tmp and not tracked, several decision/doc duplicates are tracked and increase maintenance burden.
- Pre-commit/CI enforcement is partially present (husky installed, verify script defined), but full automated enforcement (pre-commit lint-staged hooks and a CI job enforcing duplicate-detect) is not clearly enforced in the repository itself.

**Next Steps:**
- Consolidate and canonicalize duplicate ADR/doc files (merge 0013 variants into a single canonical ADR) and commit the consolidation in small, documented commits.
- Address remaining lint warnings by applying minimal edits: prefix intentionally-unused variables with `_`, remove unused imports/variables, and re-run eslint --fix; commit per-file fixes.
- Add a lightweight pre-commit hook (lint-staged) to enforce eslint --fix and prettier on staged files, and ensure Husky hooks are enabled for contributors.
- Add a CI job to run scripts/duplicate-detect.sh (fail on tracked duplicates) and include `npm run verify` as a required check to enforce the project's verify order in CI.
- Re-run full `npm run verify` locally after fixes and confirm no warnings/errors; include results in ADR or decision notes to document the cleanup.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (80% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- The repository has a comprehensive, high-coverage Vitest test suite that has historically run green and achieves excellent coverage, but a recent verification run failed at the linting stage (not at test execution). Until the lint issues are fixed and a full verify completes, the recent cycle is not fully green.
- Extensive Vitest suites exist (many unit, integration and smoke tests) including package-export and CLI integration tests.
- Historical test coverage reached ~100% (Istanbul configured, dual testing strategy applied for scripts).
- Several tests depend on built artifacts and package packing (tests that import from ./dist and pack+install flows).
- Recent pipeline runs show a successful test run in prior cycles, but the most recent `npm run verify` stopped at linting with ESLint warnings/errors and therefore did not reach the test phase.
- Current working tree contains three modified source files (scripts/copy-assets.ts, scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts, src/utils/safe-spawn.ts) that were modified by eslint --fix and still have a few remaining warnings (unused variables/params).
- Because the latest verify did not complete to the test phase, we cannot claim a fully green run in the very latest development cycle despite prior successes.

**Next Steps:**
- Run `npm run lint:check` and inspect /tmp/lint-check-after-autofix.log to identify remaining lint problems, commit minimal fixes (prefix unused variables with `_` or remove them).
- Stage and commit the three modified files (one commit per file) then run `npm run lint:check` again until lint is clean.
- Run `npm run verify` locally to produce a full end-to-end green run (audit fix, lint, format, build, tests). Capture output for CI validation.
- If any tests fail after lint fixes, run targeted `npx vitest --reporter=verbose` and address test failures; re-run verify until fully green.
- Once verify is green, record the successful run and re-run duplicate-detect and ADR confirmation steps as planned.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (85% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The project has a working build/test pipeline and was previously validated (dist/ exists, package.json scripts, tests and verify ran successfully). However there are outstanding lint warnings and unstaged modifications from recent autofix runs that require finishing (commit and re-run verify) before declaring full, current validation.
- Build artifacts (dist/) are present in the repository and package.json exports point to compiled files under ./dist/.
- package.json includes build, test, verify, and markdown-generation scripts; earlier runs of `npm run verify` and targeted tests completed successfully per the recorded history.
- Vitest test suites were added and earlier runs report full coverage (100%) and many tests referencing dist/ artifacts and exports.
- Recent operations ran eslint --fix on three source files (scripts/copy-assets.ts, scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts, src/utils/safe-spawn.ts) and modified those files in the working tree (git status shows them modified but not staged).
- After autofix, a small number of warnings remain (unused bindings/parameters) which require minimal manual edits (prefix unused names with `_` or remove unused imports).
- No current logs show a failing build step; the last full verify previously reached lint and build stages successfully, but verify has not been re-run since the latest source edits.
- Scripts that generate files (generate-markdownlint-config.ts) and copy assets (copy-assets.ts) are implemented with testable exported functions and CLI guards, following the dual testing strategy.
- Some tests depend on package-lock.json and packed tarball behavior; package-lock was regenerated earlier and was present during previous verification runs.

**Next Steps:**
- Stage and commit the three autofix-modified files (one commit per file or a grouped commit) so the working tree is clean.
- Resolve remaining lint warnings with minimal edits: prefix intentionally-unused params with `_`, rename unused catch variables to `_err`, and remove any dead imports.
- Re-run lint check: `npm run lint:check` and fix remaining issues until clean.
- Run formatting and markdown autofix: `npm run lint:md:fix` and `npm run format`, then commit formatting changes.
- Run the full verification pipeline: `npm run verify` and capture the output; address any failing stage (build/test) per logs.
- If verification succeeds, run the duplicate-detect script and append a short confirmation to ADR-0013 as planned, then push the clean commits.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (88% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is comprehensive and developer-focused: README, consumer quickstart, API reference, ADRs, usage guides, and library-specific pages are present and generally clear. A few duplications, minor clarity gaps, and a small set of missing cross-references prevent it from being perfect.
- README.md: strong, practical, and includes install/use examples for TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, and Markdown linting; includes peer dependency list and quick commands.
- docs/CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md: very detailed step-by-step consumer integration guide (tsconfig files, jiti notes, scripts). Good for onboarding consumers but slightly dense.
- docs/API.md: succinct surface-level reference for exports (testing, eslint, prettier, typescript, markdown). Useful but could include more concrete return-type examples or small snippets for each export.
- docs/libraries/usage/: contains multiple dependency-specific usage pages (esbuild, eslint-plugin-import, unicorn, vitest, markdown-lint). These are helpful for implementers and LLM agents and are explicitly protected.
- docs/decisions/: Extensive ADR collection documenting governance and decisions; excellent for maintainers and auditability. ADRs are consistent and detailed.
- Scripts & docs integration: README and docs reference provided scripts (generate-markdownlint-config, copy-assets) and show how to use them — good dog-fooding examples.
- Markdown linting and formatting guidance: .markdownlint.json, markdownlint-cli2 guidance, and examples are present. The project enforces markdown linting and documents how to generate the config.
- Gaps & small issues: some duplicate/near-duplicate decision files (multiple ADR 0013 variants) and a few doc files with minor formatting/lint issues referenced in history; API.md is light on examples and types; troubleshooting and quick fixes could be more explicit (e.g., jiti, NODE_OPTIONS, lockfile guidance).

**Next Steps:**
- Consolidate duplicate ADR/docs artifacts (there are multiple ADR-0013 variants) into a single canonical ADR and update docs/decisions/README accordingly to reduce maintenance overhead and eliminate confusion.
- Expand docs/API.md with one-line code snippets and return-type examples for each exported factory (e.g., shape of createVitestNodeConfig(), sample prettier config object) to help consumers quickly validate usage.
- Add a short Troubleshooting section (or expand CONSUMER-QUICKSTART) covering the most common verification failures: missing jiti, NODE_OPTIONS for TypeScript configs, absent package-lock.json, and how to run the verify pipeline locally.
- Perform a docs lint/format sweep to resolve the remaining markdownlint issues (notably those referenced in history) and ensure all user-facing docs conform to .markdownlint.json and Prettier rules.
- Add a one-page 'Exports & Packaging' doc covering package.json exports mapping to dist files and how to validate them locally (pack + test-consumer flow), referencing existing dist-related tests to help new maintainers.
- Link cross-references where helpful (README → API.md → examples in docs/libraries/usage) so readers can move from high-level guidance to concrete examples without hunting across files.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (90% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are in good shape: the repository has a regenerated lockfile, npm audit runs reported zero vulnerabilities, peer/dev dependency alignment (notably Vitest and its coverage provider) is enforced, and required tooling (jiti, markdownlint-cli2, prettier, eslint, typescript) is declared. A few packages are intentionally pinned or older (tooling like esbuild) and should be monitored, but there are no immediate high‑severity security concerns.
- Recent repository audit cycles produced npm audit results with total vulnerabilities = 0 (lockfile regenerated and audited).
- Vitest and coverage provider versions are exact/pinned (3.2.4) per ADR-0005/0009; package.json shows both devDependencies and peerDependencies aligned for testing tooling — this enforces compatibility but increases maintenance responsibility.
- PeerDependencies list the consumer-required tools (eslint, prettier, typescript, vitest, markdownlint-cli2, etc.), improving consumer visibility of required tools and reducing runtime bundling risk.
- Several devDependencies are recent and appropriate for a tooling package (eslint @9.34.0, prettier ^3.x, typescript ^5.x, vitest 3.2.4) meaning good compatibility with the project’s TypeScript/ESM targets.
- Some entries are older or exact versions (e.g., esbuild ^0.25.9 in devDependencies) — while not flagged as vulnerable by audits, such older tool versions should be considered for scheduled updates to capture fixes and performance improvements.
- The repo uses npm lockfile (was regenerated) so installs are reproducible; audit and verify scripts include `npm audit fix --force` as required by policy which keeps dependency currency but may introduce breaking changes that the verify pipeline needs to catch promptly.
- markdownlint-cli2 is declared as both peerDependency and devDependency which is acceptable given ADR-0006 (tool required by consumers) but maintainers should keep peer/dev versions aligned to avoid consumer confusion.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue scheduled `npm audit --json` scans and capture results in CI; fail builds on new high-severity issues and triage immediately.
- Plan periodic dependency refreshes (quarterly) focusing on build/tooling packages (esbuild, tsx, nyc) and test-related providers; test the verify pipeline after each refresh.
- Keep vitest and coverage-provider version alignment enforced (automated test verifying alignment already exists) and add a small automated guard that flags misalignment in PRs.
- Enable automated dependency updates (dependabot/renovate) with a policy to open update PRs for non-breaking bumps; route major updates to a short stabilization window with test/verify runs.
- Monitor upstream advisories for packages with long-lived minor versions (esbuild) and update proactively; run a one-off manual SCA scan (Snyk/OSS Index) for deeper coverage if required.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (78% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Overall the codebase demonstrates many good secure-coding practices (explicit path checks, avoiding shells in spawn, atomic file writes, symlink checks), but a few operational and supply-chain risks remain (automatic `npm audit fix --force`, uses of execSync with interpolated commands in tests/scripts, and tests that print environment variables). These should be remediated or mitigated to raise the security posture.
- Safe process spawn: safeSpawn uses spawn without a shell and validates inputs; this avoids shell interpolation risk for new code paths.
- Scripts avoid shell usage in unit-testable code: key business logic (copyAssets, generateMarkdownlintConfig) is exported as functions and unit-tested, reducing reliance on fragile subprocess-only paths.
- Path handling hardening: copy-assets implements resolution and a path traversal check (ensures resolved path startsWith absSrcDirWithSep) and skips symlinks, which mitigates common file traversal and symlink attacks.
- Atomic file writes: generate-markdownlint-config writes to a temp file then renames, reducing risk of partial writes or TOCTOU races for consumers reading the config.
- Preserving mode bits and explicit lstat checks: copy-assets preserves file modes and uses lstat to avoid following symlinks; good for not accidentally copying device/special files.
- Use of execSync in tests and helpers: multiple tests and helper scripts call execSync with interpolated command strings (e.g., `node ${testFile}`, `npm pack`, `npm install`) — these are safe in the current repo-controlled context but would be risky if any argument were influenced by untrusted input.
- Automatic dependency modification: the mandated verify script runs `npm audit fix --force` automatically. While this reduces reported vulnerabilities, it introduces supply-chain risk by automatically upgrading or changing dependency versions without human review, which can introduce breaking or malicious changes.
- Environment leakage in tests: debug/tests (e.g., debug-coverage.test.ts) and some subprocess invocations log environment variables (coverage-related and others). If run in CI with secrets exposed to test environment, logs could leak sensitive values.
- Remaining lint warnings indicate unused variables (some in scripts) which can hide developer intent; specifically unused parameters like `signal` or `_unlinkErr` were flagged — these are lower-severity but should be addressed to avoid confusion in error handling paths.
- package.json and workflow: package is `private: true` (good), and many security-minded ADRs exist. However, automated `npm pack` and local install patterns in integration tests increase complexity and require careful isolation in CI.

**Next Steps:**
- Replace subprocess execSync usages in production/test helpers with safeSpawn (or spawn with argument arrays) to eliminate shell/word-splitting risks; validate arguments are not influenced by untrusted input.
- Remove or guard tests that log environment variables (coverage/debug tests) so CI secrets are not printed. Prefer explicit, minimal diagnostics and redact or avoid printing process.env in CI.
- Re-evaluate policy of `npm audit fix --force` in verify pipeline: change to reporting + human review or pin a curated update process to avoid automatic dependency changes that can introduce supply-chain risk.
- Harden path traversal checks: consider using path.relative checks (e.g., ensure path.relative(absSrcDir, srcPath) does not start with '..') to robustly handle edge cases like symlinks, case-insensitive filesystems, or path normalization variants.
- Address remaining lint warnings by prefixing intentionally-unused parameters/vars with an underscore (consistent with project lint rules) and remove truly unused imports to reduce maintenance/clarity issues.
- Add CI isolation for npm pack/install integration tests (run in sandboxed ephemeral container or use appropriate npm flags) and ensure no network-facing side effects while running tests.
- Add a small security checklist to CONTRIBUTING.md documenting which tests may reveal secrets and CI practices for running verify safely (e.g., run audit fix only in a controlled maintenance branch with review).

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (92% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- Version control is healthy and well-managed: critical source, configs and docs are tracked, build artifacts are ignored, and there are only a few small unstaged edits. No signs of conflicts or corruption are present. Commit, verify, and push the remaining changes to restore a fully clean working tree.
- Working tree: 3 modified tracked files (scripts/copy-assets.ts, scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts, src/utils/safe-spawn.ts) — well under the automatic cap thresholds.
- No untracked project files reported (0 untracked), and git-ignored patterns include node_modules/, dist/, coverage/, tmp/ — build outputs are excluded correctly.
- Repository shows active progress and many small focused commits in history (ADR, docs, tests, tooling) — trunk-based development style appears in use.
- No merge conflicts or repository corruption reported in the status output; branch is a feature branch (cleanup/security-hardening-...) with ongoing work.
- Staged changes: none (the 3 modified files are unstaged). They should be committed after local verification to avoid drifting state.
- Temporary and diagnostic artifacts referenced in history are stored under /tmp and not tracked — aligns with the console-first policy and proper ignore rules.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the project's verify sequence locally (npm run verify) to validate lint, format, build and tests before committing the 3 modified files.
- Stage and commit each updated file with focused messages (one commit per file is recommended per your plan), then push the branch to the remote to keep work visible.
- After commits, re-run a strict lint check (npm run lint:check) and the full verify pipeline; if any verify stage fails, address the issue with minimal, well-scoped changes.
- Run the duplicate-detect script and append a short confirmation note to the ADR if verification passes, then commit the ADR update.
- Consider enabling a lightweight pre-push or pre-commit check (lint-staged / husky) to prevent unstaged or unverified changes from being pushed in the future.
