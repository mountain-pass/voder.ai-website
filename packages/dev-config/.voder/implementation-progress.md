![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (62% ± 7% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

Overall INCOMPLETE: core features exist but the TypeScript build is blocked by rootDir errors, repository contains many untracked/compiled artifacts and code-quality problems, and execution/build verification is not yet complete.

## NEXT PRIORITY

Resolve TypeScript build errors by moving offending top-level config/scripts into src (one file per iteration), re-run tsc until clean, then rebuild and run tests.

## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 12% COMPLETE)

- Core configuration exports and tooling features are implemented (ESLint complete export, TypeScript presets, Prettier TS config, Vitest factory, markdown linter abstraction and CLI helper). Most required functionality exists, but build/test verification and a final clean build pass remain to be confirmed.
- ESLint: `eslint/index.ts` and compiled `eslint/index.js` export a `complete` flat-config that includes file coverage, ignores, and test/script globals as required.
- Prettier: `prettier.config.ts` exists and is a direct re-export of the package prettier config as required by ADRs.
- TypeScript: `typescript/*.json` presets exist (base, node, library, test) and are re-exported under `@voder/dev-config/typescript` including tsconfig.eslint/config JSON exports.
- Testing: `createVitestNodeConfig()` factory and `testSetup` mapping are implemented and tested in multiple suites.
- Markdown linting: `linters/markdown` provides `getConfig()` and `createCLICommand()` per ADR-0006 and scripts exist to generate `.markdownlint.json`.
- Package exports: `package.json` includes dual export paths (main index and dedicated paths) pointed at `dist/` artifacts; tests exist to validate export equivalence and package integration.
- Build tooling: `scripts/copy-assets.ts` and `scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts` are implemented to copy JSON assets and generate markdownlint configs for packaging.
- Automated tests: Extensive Vitest suites exist (export-equivalence, smoke, package-structure, dist/imports, markdown linter, JSON loader, runtime validation, dependency alignment).
- Outstanding build hygiene: TypeScript compilation previously failed with TS6059/TS2209 (rootDir vs top-level files). Some top-level files were moved into `src/` and changes staged, but a full, current clean `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` run and `npm run build` verification remain to be completed.
- Repository cleanliness: Compiled JS/.d.ts/.map artifacts are present in the working tree (many untracked compiled files). They appear not to be committed, but a cleanup (ensure no compiled artifacts are tracked) and final commit of source moves is required.

**Next Steps:**

- Run a full TypeScript build: npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json and fix any remaining TS errors (follow single-file-move policy if TS6059 resurfaces).
- Execute packaging build: npm run build and verify copy-assets writes completion messages to stderr (confirm dist/prettier.config.js, dist/src/index.js, dist/eslint/index.js, dist/typescript/\*.json exist).
- Run focused packaging tests: npx vitest run src/tests/package-exports.test.ts src/tests/dist-files.test.ts src/tests/package-structure.test.ts and address any runtime import/export issues.
- Run dependency-alignment test: npx vitest run src/dependency-alignment.test.ts and, if needed, align package-lock.json via npm ci or update with an ADR if lockfile change required.
- Remove or .gitignore any stray compiled artifacts from the repository root, stage and commit only the minimal source moves/tsconfig edits required to pass builds/tests, then push.
- After a clean build and test pass, run full verification: npm run verify and only then publish or merge changes.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (25% ± 10% COMPLETE)

- Project has strong tooling (ESLint flat config, Prettier, Vitest, markdownlint abstraction, TypeScript presets and scripts) but repository contains substantial duplication of compiled artifacts and redundant files which harms maintainability and forces a conservative quality score.
- Required quality tools are present and configured: eslint (flat v9 layers + complete export), prettier (TypeScript config re-export), vitest (many tests, coverage settings), and markdownlint abstraction with generator script.
- package.json includes the recommended verification scripts (lint, lint:check, lint:md, format, build, verify) showing enforcement paths are available.
- Substantial duplication of content detected: many source .ts files have corresponding compiled .js, .d.ts, and .map files present in repository directories (eslint/_.ts vs eslint/_.js, scripts/_.ts vs scripts/_.js, prettier.config.ts and prettier.config.js, vitest.config.ts and vitest.config.js). This indicates copy of build outputs into source tree or uncleaned build artifacts.
- Redundant/unnecessary files and noise: numerous generated artifacts and source duplicates are untracked or mixed into repo (many .js/.d.ts/.map files listed as untracked), plus a previously-present .eslintignore workaround was created which the guidance explicitly forbids.
- Project guidance is largely implemented (dual export strategy, ADRs, TypeScript presets, tests). However the existence of generated/duplicate files and temporary workarounds violates the 'source-only repository' and 'no workaround files' policies and increases maintenance burden.

**Next Steps:**

- Remove compiled artifacts from source directories and ensure only TypeScript source files are tracked; add a clean-up commit that removes .js/.d.ts/.map duplicates (do not remove dist/ if intentionally exposed to voder).
- Run a repository-wide clean (git clean -fd) after verifying untracked build artifacts are safe to remove, and ensure .gitignore covers all build outputs and temporary files.
- Keep only one canonical copy of each config file under src/ (or documented root-layer re-exports) to avoid duplication; revert any copied .js/.d.ts files tracked in source tree.
- Re-run npm run verify and the TypeScript build to confirm no lingering TS6059/TS2209 issues and that packaging tests pass using only source files.
- Consider adding a small CI/pre-commit check to prevent committing compiled artifacts and to enforce the 'no workaround files' rules described in the project guidance.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (80% ± 12% COMPLETE)

- The repository contains a comprehensive Vitest test suite with many targeted integration and smoke tests and high claimed coverage, but recent TypeScript build issues are blocking reliable full runs in this workspace.
- There is broad test coverage: unit, export-equivalence, package-structure, packaging-integration, markdown linter, and runtime validation tests are present (many files under src/tests/).
- Tests exercise real packaging scenarios (npm pack, temp consumer installs) and verify package.json exports, which is high-value integration testing.
- Documentation and ADR-driven tests exist (dependency-alignment, validateRuntimeEnvironment) that guard governance rules as code.
- The project history indicates earlier full runs passed (high coverage claimed), but the most recent work shows TypeScript compile errors (TS6059/TS2209) and build failures that prevent a clean, repeatable full test run in the current working tree.
- Some tests depend on compiled artifacts (dist/) or on a successful build/pack step; until build issues are resolved those tests cannot reliably pass in CI/local runs.

**Next Steps:**

- Fix the TypeScript build errors (follow the planned single-file move approach to resolve TS6059) and re-run the full test suite (npx vitest run or npm test).
- After a clean compile, run focused packaging tests (pack + temp install tests) and then the entire test suite to confirm a recent full green run.
- If any tests fail post-build, address failures iteratively (start with build/runtime import errors, then unit/integration failures), and re-run tests until consistently green.
- Add/verify a CI job that runs tsc → build → focused packaging tests → full test suite to ensure ongoing recent-green validation.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (30% ± 8% COMPLETE)

- Build/test pipeline is not yet validated end-to-end: a TypeScript rootDir error was observed and only a single file move was performed; the TypeScript compile and full build have not been re-run to confirm success.
- Previous tsc run failed with TS6059/TS2209 (files not under rootDir).
- A single corrective action was taken: eslint.config.ts was moved into src/ (now untracked in git status).
- TypeScript compile (npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json) has not been re-run after the move; no evidence of a successful clean compilation.
- There are many untracked compiled artifacts (.js, .d.ts, .map) present in the working tree indicating prior builds; repository hygiene must be addressed before committing.
- package.json exports point to ./dist artifacts and dist/ exists, but build outputs in dist/ are not a substitute for verifying the current source build step.
- package-lock.json was modified; dependency/lock alignment may need verification (dependency-alignment test exists).
- Prebuild step generates .markdownlint.json (scripts exist), and copy-assets exists, but copy-assets completion has not been observed in a successful build run after the recent edits.

**Next Steps:**

- Run: npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json and capture the first error; if TS6059 references another top-level file, move that single file into src/ (one move per iteration) and re-run tsc until zero errors.
- Once tsc passes, run: npm run build and confirm copy-assets writes its completion message to stderr (copy-assets prints progress to stderr).
- Run focused packaging tests: npx vitest run src/tests/package-exports.test.ts src/tests/dist-files.test.ts src/tests/package-structure.test.ts and fix any missing artifact or runtime import issues.
- Run dependency alignment check: npx vitest run src/dependency-alignment.test.ts; if it fails, run npm ci to align node_modules and re-run the test. If lockfile changes are required, prepare ADR and bundle with package.json + package-lock.json changes.
- When all verification steps pass, stage only the minimal moved files and a brief tsconfig.build.json edit (if any), run npm run verify, then commit with a focused message and push.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (88% ± 12% COMPLETE)

- Documentation is comprehensive and developer-focused: good README/QuickStart, API reference, ADRs, usage guides (ESLint, TypeScript, Vitest, Markdown), and CONTRIBUTING/security guidance. A few minor inconsistencies and missing quick references (Node version, small setup/troubleshooting steps) reduce the score slightly.
- README.md: strong Quick Start, usage examples for testing, prettier, eslint, and markdown lint integration; lists peer deps and scripts clearly.
- API.md: concise reference for exports (testing, eslint, prettier, typescript, markdown helpers) useful for consumers and automated checks.
- docs/decisions/: full set of ADRs documenting key governance decisions (peer deps, markdownlint selection, prettier TS config, vitest alignment, supply-chain policy).
- docs/libraries/usage/: targeted usage docs for dependencies (esbuild, eslint-plugin-import, unicorn, vitest, markdownlint) — helpful for implementers and LLM-agent consumption.
- CONTRIBUTING.md & SECURITY.md: provide clear contributor workflow, verify steps, and supply-chain audit policy.
- Scripts & examples: generate-markdownlint-config and copy-assets scripts are present and documented; package.json scripts align with documentation.
- TypeScript config templates: tsconfig presets are present under typescript/ and exposed via package exports; tests validate tsconfig exports (tsconfig-exports.test.ts).
- Consistency issues: small mismatches across docs (e.g., Node version recommendations appear in different places/templates) that can confuse users about the precise minimum Node requirement.
- Dogfooding caveat: some repo state (e.g., presence of .eslintignore in the working tree) appears inconsistent with assertive doc statements that such files should not exist — docs should be reconciled with current repo state.
- Missing micro-guides: while examples are present, step-by-step troubleshooting for common consumer issues (e.g., 'Cannot find module jiti', NODE_OPTIONS usage for prettier TS config) could be consolidated into a short Troubleshooting section.

**Next Steps:**

- Reconcile and state a single authoritative Node.js requirement (update README and ADRs/templates to match).
- Add a short Troubleshooting subsection in README or docs (jiti missing, NODE_OPTIONS for prettier TS configs, common ESLint import/parsing errors) with exact commands and expected symptoms.
- Audit docs for any contradictory statements (for example, claims that .eslintignore should not exist) and either update text or align repository state to the doc.
- Add a one‑page Quick Reference that maps package.json exports → consumer import paths and the minimal steps to wire up ESLint/Prettier/Vitest (copy‑pasteable snippets), to reduce onboarding friction.
- Maintain docs/libraries/usage files when updating peer dependency ranges and record the change in ADRs so the usage guides always match supported versions.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (85% ± 12% COMPLETE)

- Overall dependency posture is good: peer/dev requirements are declared, vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 are version-aligned per ADR, and repository audit history indicates zero high-severity findings. There are minor concerns about duplicated peer/dev declarations and a possibly stale esbuild entry that warrant targeted updates and ongoing automated monitoring.
- Repository contains explicit peerDependencies for consumer tools (eslint, prettier, typescript, vitest, markdownlint-cli2, etc.), which improves consumer clarity and avoids bundling toolchains.
- DevDependencies mirror many peers (eslint, @typescript-eslint, prettier, vitest, markdownlint-cli2, jiti) enabling local development and tests; this duplication is intentional but should be kept in sync.
- Vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 are pinned/aligned to 3.2.4 in devDependencies (exact) satisfying ADR-0005 and avoiding peer-version mismatches — strong positive.
- Project history indicates an audit was run and vulnerabilities were reduced to zero; package-lock.json was regenerated as part of maintenance.
- Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript, and major tooling are declared with reasonable semver ranges (carets) allowing non-breaking upgrades while preserving compatibility.
- The package lists jiti in peers/dev and relies on it for TypeScript config loading in ESLint — this is required and documented, but consumers must install it (documented in README).
- esbuild is listed as devDependency at ^0.25.9 which appears older relative to recent esbuild major/minor cadence; this should be validated (possible upgrade candidate).
- Mix of caret ranges and exact pins (e.g., vitest exact) is deliberate for alignment but increases maintenance burden; automated tooling should monitor mismatches.
- package-lock.json shows modifications in the working tree — ensure lockfile and package.json remain committed together when performing dependency updates.

**Next Steps:**

- Run a fresh automated scan: npm audit --audit-level=moderate && npm outdated && npm ls --depth=0 to list outdated or vulnerable packages.
- Investigate and, if needed, update esbuild to a maintained recent release (test build/test suite after upgrade).
- Maintain vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 alignment policy when updating: update both together and include ADR when changing major versions.
- Enable automated dependency updates (Dependabot/Renovate) configured to create grouped PRs for tooling stacks to preserve alignment.
- Add CI SCA checks (e.g., npm audit or third-party SCA) to fail builds on high/critical vulnerabilities and surface changes in dependency tree.
- When changing dependencies, update package.json and package-lock.json together and run npm ci locally/CI to validate reproducible installs.
- Periodically review peer/dev duplicates and document the intended duplication policy in README/ADR to avoid accidental divergence.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 12% COMPLETE)

- Overall the codebase shows good security hygiene (private package, supply-chain ADRs, audit scripts, registry-mirror guidance) with low direct code-level vulnerabilities, but there are a few maintainability and supply-chain risks (outdated dev deps, scripts that write files and spawn processes) that should be mitigated.
- Positive controls: package is private, ADRs require supply-chain audits and a registry-mirror policy, and an `audit:ci` script exists to fail on high-severity issues.
- Dev/test scripts and build helpers (scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts, scripts/copy-assets.ts, test helpers) perform filesystem writes and spawn child processes; while intended for development/test, they increase attack surface if untrusted input or CI misuse occurs.
- Tests and helpers use child_process.execSync (e.g., packaging/integration tests run `npm pack` and `npm install` on a generated tarball). These operations are normal for packaging tests but can execute lifecycle scripts from installed packages — treat carefully in CI and ephemeral environments.
- A few dependency versions look dated in package.json devDeps (for example esbuild@^0.25.9) which may carry known vulnerabilities; keeping tooling dependencies current is important for SCA.
- validateRuntimeEnvironment() asserts presence of `jiti` and tsconfig JSON files. It reports clear errors but relies on require.resolve — acceptable, but ensure runtime validation does not run in untrusted contexts.
- jsonLoader.ts resolves JSON via a constructed path. It uses fixed relative paths in tests, but the loader could be abused if passed unvalidated external input — consider restricting usage to internal module-only contexts or adding sanity checks.
- Scripts write files into the repository root (generate-markdownlint-config writes `.markdownlint.json`). Repository policy elsewhere discourages creating persistent output in the repo; generating files in repo can cause accidental commits of generated content and leaking of state — prefer OS temp or explicit consumer actions.
- No obvious secrets or network calls are present in source code; no runtime network I/O or external credential handling was found.
- package-lock.json is present and dependency-alignment tests exist; ensure lockfile integrity is enforced (CI) and lockfile updates are paired with ADRs when necessary.

**Next Steps:**

- Run a full SCA scan (npm audit, snyk/OSS-Fuzz/other) and remediate or upgrade flagged devDependencies (especially old esbuild).
- Harden CI: enforce `npm audit --audit-level=high`, validate package-lock integrity, and ensure CI uses the approved registry mirror `.npmrc` to avoid rogue registries.
- Limit and sandbox any test/build actions that run `npm install` on unpacked tarballs; run these in ephemeral containers or restricted CI agents to reduce risk from lifecycle scripts.
- Avoid writing persistent generated files into the repository root during automated runs; use tmp directories or require an explicit developer action to generate repo files and add them to .gitignore if temporary.
- Add dependency-update automation (Dependabot or Renovate) and pin/update transitive toolchain versions; add a periodic job to check for toolchain CVEs.
- Add basic input validation or restrict APIs for utilities like jsonLoader if they may be called with dynamic input.
- Consider signing or otherwise validating the lockfile in CI and documenting the process for ADRs when lockfile changes are required.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (20% ± 12% COMPLETE)

- Version control hygiene is poor: 52 uncommitted files (7 modified + 45 untracked) and 2 local commits ahead of origin. While no conflicts are reported and critical sources appear tracked, the large number of uncommitted/untracked files (including compiled artifacts) and unpushed commits materially degrade collaboration safety.
- Total uncommitted files = 52 (7 modified/unstaged + 45 untracked). This falls in the 50-99 range which imposes a hard cap of 25%.
- Repository is ahead of origin by 2 commits (push pending). Being 2 commits ahead is a serious collaboration concern and further reduces effective score.
- Many untracked files are compiled artifacts and generated maps (JS/.d.ts/.map) visible due to .voderignore negation. They are correctly listed in .gitignore but remain untracked in working tree — cluttering the workspace.
- No merge conflicts or corruption are indicated in git status; CI/ADR docs and decision records are present and tracked.
- Critical source files and configs appear tracked (src/, typescript/, eslint/, tests), which avoids catastrophic failure, but the uncommitted changes and unpushed commits harm team visibility and integration safety.
- package-lock.json modified — dependency/lock alignment should be verified before pushing to avoid breaking CI or consumers.

**Next Steps:**

- Commit or stash the 7 modified files in small, focused commits with clear messages. Run full verify locally before pushing.
- Decide on handling the 45 untracked files: remove generated build outputs from working tree (git clean) and ensure .gitignore covers them; keep only source files tracked. If any of the untracked files are source, add and commit them.
- Push the 2 local commits immediately after verification to synchronize with remote (minimize collaboration friction).
- If package-lock.json changed intentionally, run npm ci locally and re-run src/dependency-alignment.test.ts; prepare ADR if lockfile/package.json versions must change and include ADR with the commit.
- Consider a short follow-up to remove committed build artifacts and ensure build outputs remain ignored; add pre-push or CI safeguards to prevent future accumulation of generated files in the working tree.
