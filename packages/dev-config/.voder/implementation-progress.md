![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (95.5% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
Functional completeness achieved, but documentation clarity, security enforcement, and version control hygiene score below 95%, so overall status is incomplete.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Commit and push all uncommitted changes to maintain repository synchronization and version control hygiene



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (100% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- All requested features and requirements are implemented and thoroughly tested, meeting functional expectations
- TypeScript presets, ESLint flat config layers, Prettier config, Vitest config, and markdown linting commands are fully implemented and exported
- Script utilities (copy-assets, generate-markdownlint-config), safeSpawn, and validateRuntimeEnvironment functions are available with unit and integration tests
- Dual export and package.json exports integration tests confirm consumer usage works correctly
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%) across all modules, with 100% code coverage reported
- Documentation (README, API reference, Consumer Quickstart) and ADRs reflect implemented functionality

**Next Steps:**
- Run `npm run verify` to ensure all tests and quality checks pass
- Stage and commit any pending changes (package.json, lockfile modifications) to maintain sync

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (95% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- The repository exhibits excellent adherence to the project's quality standards: ESLint flat config, Prettier, markdownlint, audit, type-check, build and test scripts are all configured and enforced via the verify pipeline. No unnecessary or duplicate files are present, and coding conventions follow the documented guidance.
- Comprehensive verify script includes `npm audit fix --force`, lint:fix, lint:check, lint:md:fix, format, build and test:ci.
- ESLint flat config v9 is implemented in a single-line root file, composing base, dx, and performance layers with required ignores and overrides.
- Prettier configuration is provided as a TypeScript module (`prettier.config.ts`) and integrated into formatting scripts with `NODE_OPTIONS`.
- Markdown linting abstraction uses `markdownlint-cli2` with getConfig() and createCLICommand(), and scripts to generate `.markdownlint.json` are tested.
- TypeScript presets and JSON configs (`tsconfig.eslint.json`, `tsconfig.config.json`) are exported and validated by tests.
- Vitest configuration factory (`createVitestNodeConfig`) applies Istanbul coverage with thresholds and global test setup, and is used in root `vitest.config.ts`.
- Utility scripts (`copy-assets`, `generate-markdownlint-config`) follow the dual testing strategy with unit and integration tests, achieving high coverage.
- Runtime validation checks for required peer dependency `jiti` and presence of tsconfig files, with tests exercising failure and success paths.
- Project directory is clean: no temporary or backup files committed, `.gitignore` properly configured, and no redundant assets.

**Next Steps:**
- Consider adding explicit `coverage.exclude` patterns in the Vitest config factory to align with documented exclusion requirements.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (95% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Test suite is comprehensive, stable, and consistently passes with high coverage.
- Recent full verify run completed with zero test failures.
- Extensive unit, integration, and smoke tests cover all modules and scripts.
- Coverage thresholds are met (>=80% across statements, branches, functions, lines).
- No skipped or flaky tests; all tests have clear assertions and error handling.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (100% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- The build and verification pipeline completed successfully with no errors in compilation, linting, formatting, or testing.
- npm run verify executed without failures, including npm audit fix --force
- TypeScript compilation via tsc -p tsconfig.build.json succeeded and artifacts generated in dist/
- ESLint flat-config lint:check and lint:md:check passed with zero warnings
- Prettier format:check passed and no formatting changes were needed
- Vitest run --coverage passed all unit, integration, and smoke tests with coverage thresholds met
- Package export integration tests and runtime environment validations all succeeded

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (92% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- The documentation is comprehensive and well-structured, covering quickstart, API reference, integration guides, ADRs, and security policies. A few areas have overlapping content that could be consolidated for clarity.
- README.md offers a thorough quickstart, installation instructions, usage examples, API reference, and troubleshooting section.
- docs/CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md provides detailed, copy/paste-ready integration snippets for consumers.
- docs/API.md clearly documents exported modules and their properties for testing, ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, and markdown linting.
- docs/decisions/ contains a complete set of ADRs capturing architectural choices and governance policies.
- docs/libraries/usage/ offers usage guides for key dependencies, aiding correct integration.
- SECURITY.md outlines supply-chain audit and registry-mirror policies in line with ADR-0007.
- Some content in README.md and docs/CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md overlaps and may cause maintenance overhead.

**Next Steps:**
- Consolidate overlapping sections between README.md and docs/CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md into a single source of truth.
- Add cross-references in README.md to deeper guides (e.g., link to CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md) to reduce redundancy.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (100% ± 14% COMPLETE)
- No runtime dependencies are defined; all tools are declared as peer or dev dependencies, minimizing direct dependency risk.
- The dependencies field in package.json is empty, indicating no direct runtime dependencies.
- All required tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Vitest, etc.) are declared as peerDependencies.
- DevDependencies are used solely for build and test, which do not affect runtime security.

**Next Steps:**
- Maintain peerDependencies versions and review for updates periodically.
- Continue running `npm audit` in CI to catch transitive vulnerabilities.
- Consider pruning unused devDependencies (e.g., esbuild, nyc) to reduce maintenance overhead.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (92% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- Overall, the code demonstrates strong security practices with path and command injection mitigations, atomic writes, and clear runtime environment validations, but lacks programmatic enforcement of registry mirror policy and peerDependency checks.
- copyMatchingFiles includes explicit path traversal checks and skips symbolic links to mitigate directory traversal and symlink attacks.
- safeSpawn uses spawn with shell disabled and validates command and args to prevent shell injection.
- Atomic file writes in generateMarkdownlintConfig reduce risk of partial writes or race conditions.
- validateRuntimeEnvironment provides clear error messages for missing jiti or TS config files, improving developer security posture.
- Lack of programmatic enforcement for registry mirror settings and supply-chain policy relies on manual configuration.
- No runtime validation of other peerDependencies (markdownlint-cli2, eslint, prettier, vitest) could lead to missing module errors or inconsistent environments.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement programmatic checks to enforce registry mirror settings in .npmrc as part of the verify script.
- Add runtime validation for critical peer dependencies required by configuration exports to provide clearer error messages when missing.
- Review the use of npm audit fix --force to ensure security updates are manually vetted in production environments.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (90% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- The repository shows excellent version control hygiene with only 8 uncommitted changes, no untracked critical files, and the branch fully synchronized with origin.
- Total uncommitted files (staged + unstaged + untracked): 8 (under the 10-file threshold)
- Branch is up to date with 'origin/main' (no commits ahead or behind)
- Critical source files and documentation are tracked; no missing files
- Build artifacts and dependencies are correctly ignored via .gitignore

**Next Steps:**
- Stage and commit the current modifications to keep the working directory clean
- Run `npm run verify` to validate all checks before pushing
