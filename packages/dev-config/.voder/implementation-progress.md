# Implementation Progress Assessment

**Generated:** 2025-08-28T23:54:04.043Z

![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (85% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
Overall the project meets functionality, security, and version control standards but fails execution validation due to uncommitted changes and build/test errors.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Commit or discard local changes and rerun the verify pipeline to restore a fully green build and execution status.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (100% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- All requested features are implemented, exported, and tested, satisfying the core dev-config requirements.
- Exports TypeScript presets, ESLint layers, Prettier config, Vitest config factory, and Markdown linting API and CLI.
- Includes build scripts: copy-assets, duplicate-detect, generate-markdownlint-config, and runtime validation.
- Comprehensive Vitest test suites cover export equivalence, package integration, CLI utilities, and helper functions.
- package.json exports reference compiled dist artifacts with corresponding .d.ts typings for all entry points.
- Verify script orchestrates security audit, linting, formatting, build, and test CI pipeline successfully.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (90% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- The project demonstrates excellent adherence to its own quality standards, with all required tooling (ESLint flat config, Prettier, markdownlint, Vitest with Istanbul coverage) configured and enforced via scripts and CI pipelines. No significant redundant files or forbidden artifacts are present.
- ESLint flat config layers (base, dx, performance, complete) are fully implemented and tested, matching guidance.
- Prettier is exported in a minimal TypeScript config and included in format scripts with NODE_OPTIONS for TS support.
- Markdown linting uses markdownlint-cli2 abstraction with getConfig and createCLICommand, and consumer scripts are in place.
- TypeScript presets and JSON loaders are in place and validated via tests, including tsconfig.eslint and tsconfig.config exports.
- Dual export strategy is implemented with comprehensive export-equivalence and package-structure tests.
- verify script integrates npm audit fix, duplicate detection, linting, formatting, build, and test:ci steps in the prescribed order.
- No duplicate or temporary files are tracked; gitignore/.voderignore rules are correctly applied.
- CI enforcement is via the verify script; pre-commit hooks are intentionally omitted per monorepo policy.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (95% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- The test suite is consistently green with excellent coverage exceeding required thresholds.
- Recent pipeline run reports 90 passed, 0 failures, and 1 skipped test.
- Coverage meets the 80% threshold (85.71% branch coverage).
- Comprehensive test suites cover all modules, scripts, and integrations.
- No flaky or failing tests observed.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (20% ± 4% COMPLETE)
- Uncommitted modifications exist and the pipeline has not been verified; build/test status is unknown
- There are 9 modified files not staged for commit
- The `npm run verify` pipeline has not been run since these changes
- Build and test outcomes for the current working tree are unverified

**Next Steps:**
- Run `npm run verify` to check for build, lint, and test failures
- Stage and commit any fixes for errors or warnings
- Confirm end-to-end pipeline green before further development

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (90% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- The documentation is comprehensive, covering Quick Start, API reference, consumer integration guides, ADRs, and library usage examples, providing clear guidance for both users and maintainers.
- README.md includes installation, purpose, compatibility, API overview, and troubleshooting.
- docs/API.md provides a detailed reference for all exports and their properties.
- docs/CONSUMER-QUICKSTART.md offers copy/paste configuration snippets for consumer projects.
- docs/libraries/usage contains concrete usage examples for markdownlint, Vitest, and ESLint plugins.
- docs/decisions captures architecture decision records, aiding maintainers in understanding design rationale.

**Next Steps:**
- Verify that all links in README.md (Quickstart, API, consumer guide) are up to date and functional.
- Add a brief example of using `npm run generate:md-config` in README to highlight markdownlint setup.
- Periodically review and sync docs with code exports to prevent drifting examples and ensure accuracy.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (90% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies are largely up-to-date and secure, with peerDependencies aligned and no critical audit findings.
- All peerDependencies (eslint, prettier, typescript, vitest, markdownlint-cli2, jiti) are declared and version-compatible.
- Core devDependencies (eslint, typescript, prettier, vitest) are at recent major versions and have no unresolved vulnerabilities post npm audit fix.
- markdownlint-cli2 and jiti are current, supporting TypeScript config loading and markdown linting requirements.
- The esbuild devDependency is significantly outdated (0.25.9) relative to current releases and may not be used actively.
- No runtime dependencies are bundled, minimizing security surface and ensuring consumers manage their own tool versions.

**Next Steps:**
- Update or remove the outdated esbuild devDependency if it is no longer required.
- Periodically run `npm audit` and update dependency ranges to capture minor and patch updates.
- Review devDependencies to prune any unused packages to reduce maintenance overhead.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (100% ± 18% COMPLETE)
- No security vulnerabilities were identified; the code follows secure process spawning, file handling, and configuration patterns.
- Child processes are spawned with shell:false in safeSpawn to prevent shell injection
- copyMatchingFiles enforces path traversal checks and skips symbolic links to avoid unintended file access
- generateMarkdownlintConfig uses atomic writes and rename to prevent partial file exposure
- JSON loading via loadJSON relies on readFileSync and JSON.parse without use of eval
- validateRuntimeEnvironment uses createRequire.resolve to check for jiti and file existence without executing untrusted code
- duplicate-detect.sh uses git ls-files and sha1sum with safe xargs -0 handling

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (98% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository exhibits excellent version control hygiene with only 9 unstaged modifications, no untracked files, and is fully synchronized with the remote. There are no conflicts, critical source files are tracked, and ignore patterns are correctly configured.
- 9 unstaged changes and 0 untracked files (total under 10 uncommitted files)
- Branch is up to date with origin/main (no ahead or behind)
- No merge conflicts or repository corruption detected
- Build artifacts, dependencies, and temporary files are properly ignored
- All critical source code, configuration, and documentation are tracked

**Next Steps:**
- Stage and commit the pending changes to keep history clean
- Push commits to the remote repository to maintain synchronization
