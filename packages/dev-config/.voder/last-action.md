**Response:**

```
Done — I ran the FIRST step from the plan: the markdown autofix.

What I ran
- npm run lint:md:fix 2>&1 | tee /tmp/lint-md-fix.log

Where to find the console-first log
- /tmp/lint-md-fix.log

Summary of results
- Command completed successfully (markdownlint-cli2 v0.18.1).
- Files linted: 20 files (CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md, SECURITY.md, docs/decisions/*, etc.).
- Auto-fixes were applied where possible.
- Remaining issues: 3 markdownlint errors (all in docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md):

  1) docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md:78:43 MD033/no-inline-html — Inline HTML [Element: relevant]
  2) docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md:176 MD025/single-title/single-h1 — Multiple top-level headings in the same document
  3) docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md:183 MD025/single-title/single-h1 — Multiple top-level headings in the same document

Notes / next recommended action (per plan)
- The lint autofix handled many issues but left some that require manual edits (inline HTML and duplicate top-level headings). The plan's next step is to run formatting, stage and commit the auto-fixes:
  - npm run format 2>&1 | tee /tmp/format-after-docs.log || true
  - git add -A
  - git commit -m "chore(docs): apply markdown & format auto-fixes after canonicalization; refs ADR-0013" 2>&1 | tee /tmp/git-commit-docs-autofix.log || true

If you want, I can proceed with those three commands now (format → stage → commit). Otherwise I will wait for your confirmation before continuing.

<scratchpad>
- The lint:md:fix step was the correct "FIRST action" and completed as expected.
- MD033 (inline HTML) and MD025 (multiple H1s) cannot be safely auto-fixed; they need manual editing of docs/decisions/0013-cleanup-duplicate-docs.md. We should avoid touching prompts/, prompt-assets/, or .voder/ per the plan — but the .voder files are metadata changed by the tool and are expected to be committed as part of the autofix commit in the plan.
- Proceeding with format + commit is low-risk and is the next prescribed step. After that we will run full verify and iterate on any failures.
