**Response:**

```
Done — I implemented the first action from the plan.

What I changed
- Created a new .eslintignore at the repository root containing:
  - A brief comment and an entry to ignore the tmp/ directory.
- Staged and committed the change with the required commit message:
  "chore(eslint): ignore generated tmp/ artifacts to avoid linting transient files — refs ADR-0013"

Git commit
- Commit hash: aafc6b0
- Branch: cleanup/security-hardening-20250828T183725Z

Next suggested step (per plan)
- Run lint to confirm the transient-generated files are no longer being reported (e.g., npm run lint:check) and then proceed with the per-file ESLint fixes if necessary.

Would you like me to run the lint check now and continue with the next steps?
