# Last Action Executed (Agentic)

**Action:** Used tool: remove_file with input: {"filePath":"scripts/duplicate-detect.js"}
Used tool: remove_file with input: {"filePath":"scripts/duplicate-detect.cjs"}

**Response:**

```
Done â€” I removed the two untracked duplicate-detect files:

- scripts/duplicate-detect.js
- scripts/duplicate-detect.cjs

Next recommended step (per plan): create the commit that records the canonicalization. If you want, I can run the git add/git commit commands now (non-interactively) to record the change. Would you like me to do that?
```
