Planned first action: run ESLint --fix on three target files and capture output.

I ran:
npx eslint --fix scripts/copy-assets.ts scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts src/utils/safe-spawn.ts 2>&1 | tee /tmp/eslint-fix-targeted.log || true

Result: ESLint autofix completed. No errors, but 4 warnings remain (autofix didn't remove them because they require manual small edits or naming changes). I then listed changed files (git diff --name-only) to see what was modified by the autofix run.

Important findings:
- ESLint output (saved at /tmp/eslint-fix-targeted.log) reports 4 warnings:
  - scripts/copy-assets.ts: 'mkdir' and 'stat' defined but never used
  - scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts: 'unlinkErr' defined but never used
  - src/utils/safe-spawn.ts: 'signal' defined but never used; rule expects unused args to start with _
- git diff shows the three target source files are changed in the working tree (plus several .voder/* files which the plan said not to modify — we'll avoid committing those).

Next planned step per the implementation plan is to commit any changes produced by the autofix (one commit per file). I will not run the commit step yet (you asked for only the first action). If you want me to proceed, I will run the commit loop next.

Logs:
- ESLint autofix output: /tmp/eslint-fix-targeted.log
- Git diff names: /tmp/git-diff-names.log

Suggested next command (per plan) to run when you want me to continue:
for f in scripts/copy-assets.ts scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts src/utils/safe-spawn.ts; do \
  if [ -f "$f" ] && ! git diff --quiet -- "$f"; then \
    git add "$f"; \
    git commit -m "fix(${f}): eslint --fix applied — refs ADR-0013"; \
  else \
    echo "No changes to commit for $f"; \
  fi; \
done

Would you like me to proceed and commit the autofix changes now?
```
