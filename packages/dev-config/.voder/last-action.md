## Plan

```
<scratchpad>
We need to run the TypeScript compiler with the build tsconfig to surface the first rootDir-related error. Single command only. Must run from project root. Capture output to console (per console-first policy).
</scratchpad>

Run from the project root (one command):

npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json

Goal: compile with the build config and print the first TypeScript error to the console (look for TS6059 / TS2209 referencing a top-level file).
```

## Action

**Type:** run_command

**Parameters:**

```json
{
  "command": "npx",
  "parameters": ["tsc", "-p", "tsconfig.build.json"],
  "timeout": 60000
}
```
