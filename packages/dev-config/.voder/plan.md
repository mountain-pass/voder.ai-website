## NOW

âœ… **PROJECT COMPLETE - COMMIT FINAL UPDATES**

The package is production-ready at 97% completion with all critical functionality working. Commit the final assessment update and declare the project complete:

1. **Commit the updated implementation assessment**:

   ```bash
   git add .voder/implementation-progress.md
   git commit -m "docs: update implementation progress assessment to 97% completion - production ready"
   ```

2. **Final verification** (optional - already confirmed working):

   ```bash
   npm run verify
   ```

3. **Tag the completion milestone**:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0-complete -m "Development configuration package complete - production ready"
   ```

## NEXT

1. **Documentation finalization and packaging**:
   - Create release notes summarizing the complete feature set
   - Finalize consumer documentation with real-world examples
   - Prepare package for distribution/publishing workflow

2. **Quality improvements** (optional enhancements):
   - Address remaining coverage gaps in `safe-spawn.ts` (lines 53,70)
   - Resolve non-critical source map warnings in Vite integration
   - Refactor test duplication per ADR-0013

3. **Project handoff**:
   - Document deployment/publishing process
   - Create maintenance runbook for future updates
   - Establish consumer support guidelines

## LATER

**Long-term maintenance and enhancement** (project is already production-ready):

- **Version Management**: Establish semantic versioning strategy and release workflow for future updates
- **Consumer Ecosystem**: Build integration examples for popular frameworks (Next.js, Vite, Rollup, etc.)
- **Advanced Features**: Consider adding configuration presets for specific project types (libraries, CLI tools, web apps)
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Implement usage analytics for configuration adoption patterns
- **Community**: Establish contribution guidelines and issue templates for consumer feedback
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize configuration loading times for large projects
- **Continuous Improvement**: Schedule quarterly dependency updates and security audits
