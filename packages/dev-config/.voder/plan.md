## NOW
Stage, commit, and push all pending local changes to main:
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "chore: synchronize local changes for version control hygiene" && git push origin main
```

## NEXT
Run the full verification pipeline to confirm nothing breaks:
```bash
npm run verify
```

## LATER
- Update CONTRIBUTING.md to remind developers to commit and push before ending work.  
- Add a CI check that fails if there are uncommitted changes on `main`.  
- Implement a scheduled dependency maintenance job to report outdated packages and stale lockfiles.
