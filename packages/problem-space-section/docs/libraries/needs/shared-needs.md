# Problem Space Section - Shared Package Dependencies

## Purpose

This file documents what the Problem Space Section package needs from `@voder/shared` and how it intends to use those shared utilities.

## Required Interfaces from @voder/shared

### Base Component Interface
- `IComponent` with id, getState() method
- `ComponentState` type for lifecycle management
- `IConfigurableComponent<T>` for configuration management

### Section Component Interface
- `ISectionComponent` extending IComponent with render(), updateScrollProgress(), cleanup()
- `SectionServices` interface for service injection (animation, accessibility, scroll)
- `SectionConfiguration` extending ComponentConfiguration with section-specific settings
- `ScrollTriggerConfiguration` for GSAP ScrollTrigger setup
- `EffectConfiguration` for managing particle system effects

### Animation Timeline Interface
- `IAnimationTimeline` for GSAP timeline management (play, pause, reverse, seek, kill)
- `TimelineConfiguration` for timeline setup options

### Configuration Types
- `ComponentConfiguration` with id, debug, containerId, accessibility
- `AccessibilityConfiguration` for ARIA and motion preferences (critical for chaos effects)
- Configuration validation functions

### Brand Constants
- `BRAND_COLORS` for consistent Voder color palette (VODER_BLACK, PAPER_WHITE, COOL_GREY)
- `BRAND_TYPOGRAPHY` for consistent font stacks (Inter for strategic messaging)

### Error Handling
- `ComponentError` class for component-specific errors
- `ValidationError` class for configuration validation failures

### Validation Utilities
- `validateRequired<T>()` for required field validation
- `validateComponentConfiguration()` for config validation
- `validateAccessibilityConfiguration()` for accessibility config validation

### DOM Utilities
- `findFocusableElements()` for keyboard navigation setup
- `createAriaLiveRegion()` for screen reader announcements during chaos effects

### Performance Monitoring
- `PerformanceMetrics` interface for tracking chaos animation performance
- `measurePerformance()` function for FPS monitoring and optimization
- Performance thresholds and monitoring utilities

### Constants
- `ACCESSIBILITY_CONSTANTS.SCREEN_READER_DELAY` for timing announcements
- `ACCESSIBILITY_CONSTANTS.FOCUS_TRANSITION_DURATION` for smooth focus transitions
- `PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS.ANIMATION_FRAME_BUDGET` for chaos effect optimization

## Usage Patterns Specific to Problem Space Section

### Visual Chaos Management
Uses performance monitoring utilities to manage complex particle animations while maintaining 60fps performance and accessibility compliance.

### Strategic Problem Presentation
Leverages `BRAND_TYPOGRAPHY.primary` (Inter) for strategic business messaging targeting CTOs and product leaders rather than academic presentations.

### Complex Animation Accessibility
Heavily relies on screen reader alternatives and reduced motion fallbacks for particle chaos effects while providing meaningful text alternatives.

### Performance-Critical Animation
Integrates with ParticleSystemEffect requiring precise performance monitoring and dynamic quality adjustment based on device capabilities.
