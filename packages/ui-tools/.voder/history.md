Summary of work completed so far

- Added a comprehensive .gitignore covering Node build outputs/caches, temp/log files, editor/tool and OS artifacts, secrets (.env), and build/test variants. package.json and lockfiles were intentionally kept tracked (noted tracked sensitive files must be removed from the index before committing).

- Created .voderignore to expose specific artifacts to the LLM inspector (!dist/, !coverage/lcov-report/, !build/types/) while leaving large dirs like node_modules/ ignored; the file was echoed into the repo.

- Made the initial scaffold commit:
  - Command: git add . && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): initial docs and package scaffold"
  - Result: commit 5234902 on main; 24 files changed, 3,331 insertions(+).
  - Added package scaffolding, many .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs, .voderignore), docs/decisions (including symlinked decision docs), symlinked prompts/docs, and packages/ui-tools/package.json and package-lock.json.

- Ran a Node one-liner to update package.json non-interactively: set package.scripts.prepare to a no-op ('echo "prepare skipped"') if ../../setup-package-docs.js did not exist and wrote package.json in-place. Command executed successfully.

- Committed and pushed .voder tracking updates:
  - Command: git add .voder && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): update voder tracking files" && git push
  - Result: [main c7fe9bb] — 7 files changed, 409 insertions(+), 517 deletions(-). Pushed to origin/main.

- Implemented and added packages/ui-tools/src/build/postcss.ts:
  - Added a TypeScript interface PostCSSConfigOptions and createPostCSSConfig function.
  - Used ESM import of autoprefixer, included JSDoc, default browsers list, supported options.plugins, and returned a plugins array beginning with autoprefixer. File written successfully.

- Recorded multiple .voder metadata changes in follow-up commits:
  - Commit ee49965: git add .voder && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): record voder metadata changes" — 7 files changed, 474 insertions(+), 380 deletions(-).
  - Commit 76f67ed: git add .voder/history.md .voder/last-action.md .voder/plan.md && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): record voder metadata changes" — 3 files changed, 74 insertions(+), 282 deletions(-).
  - Commit abc228f: git add .voder && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): commit pending voder metadata updates" — 7 files changed, 469 insertions(+), 288 deletions(-).
  - These local commits were pushed to remote at various points.

- Added a minimal public export barrel:
  - packages/ui-tools/src/index.ts exporting createPostCSSConfig and PostCSSConfigOptions from './build/postcss.js'.
  - Committed as [main 8c4e390] feat(ui-tools): add PostCSS export barrel (createPostCSSConfig) — 1 file changed, 2 insertions.

- Stashed .voder local changes (without committing):
  - Command: git stash push -m "wip: stash .voder metadata" -- .voder || true
  - Result: Saved working directory and index state on main: "wip: stash .voder metadata".

- Most recent stash/restore attempt and resulting state:
  - Restored the stash entry labeled "wip: stash .voder metadata", applied it, added .voder, committed, and dropped the stash via a single non-interactive command. The command completed but left the repo with unstaged and uncommitted changes; git reported "no changes added to commit".
  - At that time the branch was noted as local branch ahead of origin/main by 2 commits.

- Current repository status (git status / --porcelain excerpt):
  - Unstaged modified files:
    - docs/component-hierarchy.md
    - packages/dev-config/package.json
    - packages/services/docs/decisions/README.md

- Most recent command executed to stash non-.voder changes:
  - files="$(git --no-pager diff --name-only | grep -v '^.voder/' | tr '\n' ' ')" && [ -n "$files" ] && git stash push -m "wip: save non-.voder working changes" -- $files || true
  - The command completed (no further output captured).

- Most recently attempted action (restore .voder metadata to HEAD):
  - Command run: git restore --source=HEAD -- .voder/ packages/ui-tools/.voder/ || true
  - Result: The command failed with exit code 1. stderr: error: pathspec 'packages/ui-tools/.voder/' did not match any file(s) known to git.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Restore tracked .voder paths to their HEAD state (idempotent). Run this single POSIX command from the project root:

```bash
paths="$(git ls-files -z .voder/ packages/ui-tools/.voder/ 2>/dev/null | tr '\0' '\n' || true)"; if [ -n "$paths" ]; then git restore --source=HEAD -- $paths || true; else echo "No .voder paths known to git to restore"; fi
```
---

**This was the result:**
---
`bash -lc paths="$(git ls-files -z .voder/ packages/ui-tools/.voder/ 2>/dev/null | tr '\0' '\n' || true)"; if [ -n "$paths" ]; then git restore --source=HEAD -- $paths || true; else echo "No .voder paths known to git to restore"; fi` completed.
Output:
