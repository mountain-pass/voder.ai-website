Summary of work completed so far

- Repository & metadata
  - Created repository scaffold and multiple .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md), progress logs, a progress chart, docs/decisions, and symlinks for decision docs and prompts/docs.
  - Performed repeated stash/restore cycles for .voder files, created a dedicated stash for .voder metadata, made non-interactive metadata commits, and persisted run history and verification output to packages/ui-tools/.voder/history.md.
  - At times marked packages/ui-tools/.voder files as assumed-unchanged via git update-index --assume-unchanged.

- Package scaffolding & package.json
  - Iteratively adjusted root and package package.json fields and scripts while preserving prepared/.voder fields.
  - Added top-level main/types/exports for @voder/ui-tools v1.0.0 (private, "type": "module"), removed nested "types" under "exports", and committed package.json and package-lock.json updates.

- packages/ui-tools implementation
  - Implemented src/build/postcss.ts (createPostCSSConfig, PostCSSConfigOptions) with ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, and a default browsers list.
  - Added public export barrel (src/index.ts), package tsconfig.json, guarded vite.config.ts to avoid optional-plugin import failures, and PostCSS usage documentation.

- TypeScript configuration & ADR
  - Switched root tsconfig.json.module to "NodeNext" to resolve TS5110 and enable type-check/build; updated target to ES2022, enabled declaration output, set outDir to dist, and excluded dist from compilation.
  - Added an ADR documenting devDependency decisions for ui-tools (accepted 2025-08-21).

- Toolchain & dependencies
  - Installed devDependencies non-interactively: typescript; vitest@3.2.4; @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4; @types/node; postcss; autoprefixer; @testing-library/dom; jest-axe; markdownlint-cli2; later jsdom@^26.0.0 and @testing-library/jest-dom.
  - Committed dependency changes and ran npm audit (321 total dependencies, zero reported vulnerabilities).

- Tests & test infrastructure
  - Added Vitest tests: tests/build/postcss.test.ts, tests/package-structure.test.ts, tests/smoke.test.ts.
  - Iteratively adjusted smoke test imports for ESM resolution (compiled entry → source → explicit .js extension).
  - Fixed an exports/.d.ts issue surfaced by package-structure.test.ts.

- Build, type-check & verification pipeline
  - Repeatedly ran and fixed issues in the verification pipeline (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) until successful: tsc --noEmit succeeded; full tsc build succeeded; Vitest tests passed.
  - Most recent combined verification run succeeded: tsc --noEmit succeeded; tsc build succeeded; vitest v3.2.4 ran 3 test files and all tests passed (package-structure, smoke, build/postcss).

- Vitest startup issue & mitigation
  - Encountered Vitest startup failure (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND) caused by an optional Vite plugin referenced by a generated vite.config.ts.
  - Mitigated with a guarded vite.config.ts that dynamically imports the optional plugin and exports an async Vite config with a safe plugins array.

- Git activity & notable commits
  - Performed extensive git operations: index adjustments, stash/restore cycles, add/commit/push activity, and attempts to remove tracked dist/ files.
  - Persisted .voder metadata updates across multiple commits.
  - Notable commits: 05a04a6 (smoke test import from src), 4709f47 (explicit .js in ESM import), 9773bcf & ad437db (persist .voder metadata updates), 8e5d91a (source & docs changes — 11 files changed).

- Recent repository actions & status
  - Attempted to untrack dist/ (git rm --cached -r dist returned no matching path); ran conditional commands to detect/remove tracked dist/ artifacts (no changes).
  - Appended four ignore patterns to .gitignore and committed (56a64a8).
  - Restored/unstaged then restored package-internal .voder files to HEAD; ran git add -A and created commit 8e5d91a, adding new docs/prompts and package artifacts.
  - Restored repository-level .voder metadata files to the last committed state.

- Current working-tree / git status
  - git status --porcelain showed seven modified files under packages/ui-tools/.voder:
    - history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress-log-areas.csv, progress-log.csv.

- Most recent shell actions & results
  - Executed conditional shell commands to detect/untrack dist/ build artifacts (no removals).
  - Ran git ls-files -z 'packages/ui-tools/.voder/*' | xargs -0 -r git update-index --assume-unchanged — completed successfully.
  - Executed git rm --cached -r dist || true — completed (no removals reported).
  - Ran git reset -- packages/ui-tools/.voder/ || true to unstage package-internal .voder files — they were unstaged.
  - Ran git ls-files -z 'dist/*' | xargs -0 -r git rm --cached -r || true — completed with no tracked dist/* files removed.

- Most recent recorded action
  - Marked the package-local .voder metadata files as assumed-unchanged so Git ignores local modifications:
    git ls-files -z 'packages/ui-tools/.voder/*' | xargs -0 -r git update-index --assume-unchanged
  - Command completed successfully.

- Most recent cleanliness check
  - Ran git status --porcelain in project root. Result:
    M packages/ui-tools/.voder/history.md
    M packages/ui-tools/.voder/implementation-progress.md
    M packages/ui-tools/.voder/last-action.md
    M packages/ui-tools/.voder/plan.md
    M packages/ui-tools/.voder/progress-chart.png
    M packages/ui-tools/.voder/progress-log-areas.csv
    M packages/ui-tools/.voder/progress-log.csv

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

<scratchpad>
We need to provide the single command the user specified in NOW: `git status --porcelain`. Must run from project root. Provide brief actionable guidance on what it checks and how to interpret output, but only one command may be executed by the agent. Do not include other steps or commands.
</scratchpad>

Run this in the project root to get a concise working-tree status:

git status --porcelain

**This was the result:**
---
`git status --porcelain` completed.
Output:
 M packages/ui-tools/.voder/history.md
 M packages/ui-tools/.voder/implementation-progress.md
 M packages/ui-tools/.voder/last-action.md
