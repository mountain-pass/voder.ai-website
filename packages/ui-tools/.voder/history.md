Here’s a concise history of what’s been done so far (no future plans included):

- Repository housekeeping & metadata
  - Added comprehensive .gitignore and .voderignore; deduplicated .gitignore.
  - Created initial scaffold and multiple .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs).
  - Added docs/decisions (including symlinked decision docs) and symlinked prompts/docs.
  - Managed .voder edits via stashes/filtered stashes and git-file restores; updated and committed .voder metadata across commits.
  - Stashed .voder changes with message "wip: stash .voder metadata changes".

- Package scaffold & package.json work
  - Iteratively adjusted root and package package.json fields and scripts while preserving prepared/.voder fields.
  - Added top-level main/types/exports for @voder/ui-tools v1.0.0 (private, "type": "module").
  - Removed a nested "types" entry under "exports" to avoid exposing .d.ts paths.

- packages/ui-tools implementation
  - Implemented src/build/postcss.ts (createPostCSSConfig, PostCSSConfigOptions) with ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, and default browsers list.
  - Added public export barrel (src/index.ts) and tsconfig.json for the package.
  - Added a guarded vite.config.ts to avoid optional-plugin import failures during test startup.
  - Added PostCSS usage documentation.

- TypeScript configuration & ADR
  - Switched root tsconfig.json.module to "NodeNext" to resolve TS5110 and allow type-check/build to complete.
  - Added an ADR documenting devDependency decisions for ui-tools (accepted 2025-08-21).
  - Later added "exclude": ["dist"] to root tsconfig.json to prevent TypeScript treating dist/ as input; updated compilerOptions (target ES2022, module NodeNext, declaration true, outDir dist; include: src, tests, prettier.config.ts; exclude: dist). Committed with message: "fix: exclude dist from tsconfig to avoid build overwriting inputs".

- Toolchain & dependency installs
  - Installed devDependencies non-interactively: notable packages include typescript, vitest@3.2.4, @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4, @types/node, postcss, autoprefixer, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2; later added jsdom@^26.0.0 and @testing-library/jest-dom.
  - Committed package.json and package-lock.json changes.

- Tests & test infrastructure
  - Added Vitest tests:
    - packages/ui-tools/tests/build/postcss.test.ts
    - packages/ui-tools/tests/package-structure.test.ts (validated exports point to existing dist files and do not expose .ts/.d.ts)
    - packages/ui-tools/tests/smoke.test.ts (smoke test importing compiled package entry)
  - package-structure.test.ts exposed the exports/.d.ts issue, which was fixed.

- Build, type-check & verification pipeline
  - Completed type-check and build after switching to NodeNext.
  - Repeatedly ran the verification pipeline (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) and iteratively fixed failures.
  - Fixed package-structure assertion by editing package.json exports.

- Vitest startup issue & mitigation
  - Encountered Vitest startup failure (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for an optional Vite plugin referenced by a generated vite.config.ts).
  - Mitigated by adding a guarded vite.config.ts that dynamically imports the optional plugin and exports an async Vite config with a safe plugins array.

- Git activity & miscellaneous operations
  - Repeated git index adjustments, add/commit/push cycles; stashed and restored .voder edits as needed.
  - Removed tracked dist/ files from the index (git rm --cached -r dist/) and committed.
  - Committed deduplicated .gitignore, PostCSS usage doc, tests (including smoke.test.ts), and latest .voder metadata files.
  - Recent commits included "chore: remove tracked build artifacts (dist/)" and "chore: record .voder metadata updates" (7 files changed, 295 insertions, 403 deletions).
  - Pushed local commits on branch "main" to origin.

- Verification & test results (prior to the most recent run)
  - Last full verification run completed successfully:
    - Type-check: tsc --noEmit completed.
    - Build: tsc -p tsconfig.json completed.
    - Tests (vitest v3.2.4) in packages/ui-tools: 2 test files, 2 tests — both passed.
    - Test run duration ~410–566 ms.

- Most recent verification attempt (immediately prior to adding exclude)
  - Ran npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test; build failed with TypeScript TS5055 errors (TypeScript attempted to overwrite files under dist/ that were treated as inputs). The process exited with code 1 and produced TS5055 errors for postcss.d.ts and index.d.ts.

- Most recent action taken (before the last command)
  - Added "exclude": ["dist"] to repository root tsconfig.json and committed the change:
    - git add tsconfig.json && git commit -m "fix: exclude dist from tsconfig to avoid build overwriting inputs"
    - Commit output: [main 4d40a35] fix: exclude dist from tsconfig to avoid build overwriting inputs — 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+).

- Most recent git stash action
  - Ran: git stash push -m "wip: stash .voder metadata changes" -- .voder
  - Result: Saved working directory and index state On main: wip: stash .voder metadata changes.

- Most recent executed command and immediate result
  - Command executed:
    - npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr
  - Result: The command failed; bash exited with code 1. Relevant stdout/stderr included:
    - Type-check: tsc --noEmit (ran)
    - Build: tsc -p tsconfig.json produced errors:
      - error TS5055: Cannot write file '/Users/tomhoward/Projects/voder.ai-website/packages/ui-tools/dist/src/build/postcss.d.ts' because it would overwrite input file.
      - error TS5055: Cannot write file '/Users/tomhoward/Projects/voder.ai-website/packages/ui-tools/dist/src/index.d.ts' because it would overwrite input file.

This is the recorded history up to and including the most recent failed verification run.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
<scratchpad>
We must provide only the first action: push the outstanding local commit. Give exact command and brief context: branch main, ahead by 1 commit, goal is to synchronize remote. Mention expected result and non-interactive nature. Do not include any other commands or steps.
</scratchpad>

Action goal: publish the outstanding local commit on branch main to the remote repository (synchronize branch).

Run this single non-interactive command from the project root:
git push origin main

Expected outcome:
- The local commit that is currently ahead (branch main) will be pushed to origin/main.
- On success, git will print push progress and summary to the console (stdout/stderr), which will be captured in .voder/history.md.
- After completion, the branch should be in sync with origin and you can proceed with the verification step.

**This was the result:**
---
`git push origin main` completed.
Output:
