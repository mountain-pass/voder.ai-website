Summary of work completed so far

- Repository housekeeping & metadata
  - Created repository scaffold and multiple .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs).
  - Added and deduplicated .gitignore and .voderignore; added docs/decisions and symlinked decision docs and prompts/docs.
  - Managed .voder edits with repeated stashes/restores and committed .voder metadata across several commits.

- Package scaffold & package.json
  - Iteratively adjusted root and package package.json fields and scripts while preserving prepared/.voder fields.
  - Added top-level main/types/exports for @voder/ui-tools v1.0.0 (private, "type": "module"); removed nested "types" under "exports".

- packages/ui-tools implementation
  - Implemented src/build/postcss.ts (createPostCSSConfig, PostCSSConfigOptions) with ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, and default browsers list.
  - Added public export barrel (src/index.ts), tsconfig.json, a guarded vite.config.ts to avoid optional-plugin import failures, and PostCSS usage documentation.

- TypeScript configuration & ADR
  - Switched root tsconfig.json.module to "NodeNext" to resolve TS5110 and allow type-check/build.
  - Added an ADR documenting devDependency decisions for ui-tools (accepted 2025-08-21).
  - Updated root tsconfig.json to target ES2022, module NodeNext, declaration true, outDir dist, included src/tests/prettier.config.ts, and later added "exclude": ["dist"].

- Toolchain & dependency installs
  - Installed devDependencies non-interactively (notable: typescript; vitest@3.2.4; @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4; @types/node; postcss; autoprefixer; @testing-library/dom; jest-axe; markdownlint-cli2; later added jsdom@^26.0.0 and @testing-library/jest-dom).
  - Committed package.json and package-lock.json changes.

- Tests & test infrastructure
  - Added Vitest tests:
    - packages/ui-tools/tests/build/postcss.test.ts
    - packages/ui-tools/tests/package-structure.test.ts (validated exports point to existing dist files and do not expose .ts/.d.ts)
    - packages/ui-tools/tests/smoke.test.ts (smoke test importing compiled package entry)
  - package-structure.test.ts revealed an exports/.d.ts issue that was fixed.

- Build, type-check & verification pipeline
  - Repeatedly ran the verification pipeline (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test), iteratively fixed failures until a full verification run previously completed successfully (tsc --noEmit, tsc -p tsconfig.json, and Vitest tests passing in packages/ui-tools).

- Vitest startup issue & mitigation
  - Encountered Vitest startup failure (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for an optional Vite plugin referenced by a generated vite.config.ts).
  - Mitigated by adding a guarded vite.config.ts that dynamically imports the optional plugin and exports an async Vite config with a safe plugins array.

- Git activity & miscellaneous operations
  - Performed repeated git index adjustments, add/commit/push cycles; stashed and restored .voder edits as needed.
  - Removed tracked dist/ files from the index (git rm --cached -r dist/) and committed.
  - Committed deduplicated .gitignore, PostCSS usage doc, tests, and latest .voder metadata files.
  - Recent commits included "chore: remove tracked build artifacts (dist/)" and "chore: record .voder metadata updates" (final recorded commit: 7 files changed, 422 insertions, 272 deletions).
  - Pushed local commits on branch "main" to origin; most recent git push completed.

- Verification & test results (prior to most recent run)
  - Last full verification run completed successfully:
    - Type-check: tsc --noEmit completed.
    - Build: tsc -p tsconfig.json completed.
    - Tests (vitest v3.2.4) in packages/ui-tools: 2 test files, 2 tests â€” both passed.

- Most recent verification attempt and failure
  - Command executed: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr
  - The run failed during the build with TypeScript TS5055 errors: tsc attempted to overwrite files under dist/ that were being treated as inputs.
  - Specific errors:
    - TS5055: Cannot write file '.../packages/ui-tools/dist/src/build/postcss.d.ts' because it would overwrite input file.
    - TS5055: Cannot write file '.../packages/ui-tools/dist/src/index.d.ts' because it would overwrite input file.
  - The npm command exited with code 1.

- Most recent actions immediately prior to current state
  - Added "exclude": ["dist"] to repository root tsconfig.json and committed ("fix: exclude dist from tsconfig to avoid build overwriting inputs").
  - Created a stash of .voder changes: git stash push -m "wip: stash .voder metadata changes" -- .voder.
  - Executed the verification pipeline (which failed as above).
  - Executed git push origin main; the push completed.
  - Recorded a commit: git commit -am "chore: record .voder metadata updates" (7 files changed, 422 insertions, 272 deletions).

- Final recorded state
  - Repository history records work through the most recent failed verification run and the final tracked commit that recorded .voder metadata updates.
  - The most recent git push completed successfully; the latest executed verification command failed with TS5055 build errors as recorded above.

- Dependency audit
  - Ran npm audit --json from project root; report shows 321 total dependencies (14 prod, 261 dev, 48 optional) and zero reported vulnerabilities.

- Most recently executed command and immediate result
  - Command run: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr
  - Result: Command failed with exit code 1; failure occurred during build with the TS5055 overwrite errors listed above.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Stage and commit the modified .voder metadata files so the working tree is clean.

Run this single non-interactive command from the project root:

git add .voder && git commit -m "chore: record .voder metadata updates" 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr
---

**This was the result:**
---
`bash -lc git add .voder && git commit -m "chore: record .voder metadata updates" 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr` completed.
Output:
[main 88b9285] chore: record .voder metadata updates
