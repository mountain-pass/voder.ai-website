**Most recently we've executed the following fallback action (due to request too large):**

---
Action: Create or update the repository .gitignore and .voderignore at the repo root with the specified patterns.

Goal: Exclude generated/large/temp files from VCS while allowing LLM inspection of selected build artifacts.

Run this single POSIX command from the project root to create/update both files in one step (nonâ€‘interactive):

sh -lc 'cat > .gitignore <<'\''GIT'\'' 
# Node / build outputs / caches
node_modules/
dist/
build/
coverage/
.cache/
.vite/
.nyc_output/
*.tsbuildinfo

# Temporary / output / logs (forbidden in repo)
*.log
*.txt
*.out
*.tmp
*.dump
logs/
temp/
tmp/
diagnostics/
artifacts/

# Tool artifacts & editors/IDE
.eslintcache
.DS_Store
.vscode/
.idea/
*.suo
*.user
*.swp

# OS / platform artifacts
Thumbs.db
.DS_Store

# Secrets / local environment
.env

# Build/test specific alternatives
dist-*/
coverage-*/

# Keep package.json and lockfiles tracked (do NOT ignore)
# (Intentionally not ignoring package-lock.json, yarn.lock, package.json)
GIT
cat > .voderignore <<'\''VOD'\'' 
# Negations to make specific gitignored build outputs visible to LLM agents
!dist/
!coverage/lcov-report/
!build/types/

# Keep this file minimal; do NOT negate node_modules/ or other large runtime dirs.
VOD'

After running that command, verify:
- .gitignore and .voderignore exist at ./ (project root)
- package.json and package-lock.json are NOT listed in .gitignore
- .env is listed in .gitignore and should not be committed

(If any sensitive files like .env are accidentally already tracked, remove them from the index with a follow-up git command before committing.)

**This was the result:**
---
`bash -lc cat > .gitignore <<'GIT'
# Node / build outputs / caches
node_modules/
dist/
build/
coverage/
.cache/
.vite/
.nyc_output/
*.tsbuildinfo

# Temporary / output / logs (forbidden in repo)
