Summary of work completed so far

- Repository scaffold and metadata
  - Initialized the repo with .voder metadata, progress logs/chart, docs/decisions, and symlinks for decision docs and prompts/docs.
  - Performed frequent stash/restore cycles and scanned for secrets (none found).

- package.json and publishing setup
  - Iteratively updated root and package package.json fields and scripts, preserved prepared/.voder fields where possible.
  - Added top-level main/types/exports for packages/ui-tools v1.0.0 (private, ESM) and removed nested "types" under "exports".
  - Committed package.json and package-lock.json updates.

- Implemented packages/ui-tools features
  - Added PostCSS helper (src/build/postcss.ts) with ESM autoprefixer import and default browsers list.
  - Added Vite library config helper (src/build/vite-library.ts) — ESM-only, merges PostCSS, supports entry/externals/CSS extraction, allows Vite overrides.
  - Exposed createViteLibraryConfig via src/index.ts public barrel.
  - Added packages/ui-tools/README.md.

- TypeScript and build configuration
  - Switched TypeScript to NodeNext, set target ES2022, enabled declarations, adjusted outDir/dist exclusions.
  - Recorded an ADR documenting devDependency decisions for ui-tools (accepted 2025-08-21).

- Toolchain and dependencies
  - Installed and committed dev/tooling deps non-interactively (typescript; vitest@3.2.4; @vitest/coverage-v8; @types/node; postcss; autoprefixer; @testing-library/dom; jest-axe; markdownlint-cli2; later additions including jsdom@^26.0.0 and @testing-library/jest-dom).
  - Ran npm audit across ~321 dependencies with zero reported vulnerabilities.

- Testing infrastructure and tests
  - Added Vitest tests (postcss, package-structure, smoke, vite-library) and adjusted imports for ESM resolution.
  - Created jsdom test environment setup (src/testing/setup.ts) that imports @testing-library/jest-dom, performs per-test cleanup, clears timers, and mocks matchMedia, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver.
  - Added tests/testing/setup.test.ts to assert the setup does not throw.
  - Implemented testing helpers in src/testing/helpers.ts (renderComponent, waitForAnimation, waitForNextFrame, simulateClick, simulateKeypress) and added unit tests.

- Test/build runs and iterative fixes
  - Repeatedly ran and fixed issues across type-check, build, and tests until tsc --noEmit, full tsc builds, and vitest runs passed at various points.
  - Fixed a Vitest/Vite ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND caused by an optional Vite plugin in a generated vite.config.ts by replacing it with a guarded vite.config.ts that dynamically imports the optional plugin and exports an async Vite config with a safe plugins array.
  - Resolved TypeScript errors (e.g., TS2339, TS2367) using runtime guards/casts and targeted single-file test edits to satisfy tsc without broad structural changes.
  - After fixes, npm run build, npm run type-check, and vitest previously passed in verification runs.

- Git hygiene and repository maintenance
  - Extensive stash/restore cycles, index adjustments, numerous add/commit/push actions.
  - Attempted to remove tracked dist/ files and persist/untrack .voder metadata; ran git rm --cached -r .voder and added .voder/ to .gitignore.
  - Made a repository hygiene commit (b2e7fb8) that set pretest to run build and attempted to untrack .voder/dist.

- Key files created/edited
  - src/build/vite-library.ts, src/build/postcss.ts

  - guarded vite.config.ts
  - src/testing/setup.ts, tests/testing/setup.test.ts
  - src/index.ts (public barrel)
  - src/testing/helpers.ts
  - packages/ui-tools/README.md

- Branch and push status
  - Work performed on main; recent activity (including testing helpers) pushed to origin/main.

- Most recent verification run and result
  - Executed: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test — failed with exit code 2.
  - TypeScript errors reported:
    - src/testing/setup.ts(2,10): TS2305: Module '"@testing-library/dom"' has no exported member 'cleanup'.
    - tests/testing/helpers.test.ts(7,8): TS5097: An import path can only end with a '.ts' extension when 'allowImportingTsExtensions' is enabled.
    - tests/testing/setup.test.ts(2,43): TS5097: An import path can only end with a '.ts' extension when 'allowImportingTsExtensions' is enabled.
  - The failure and console output were recorded in .voder/history.md.

- Most recent file edits and staging
  - Updated src/testing/setup.ts to remove the named import cleanup from '@testing-library/dom' and replace the cleanup() call with an explicit DOM cleanup loop that removes all children of document.body, while keeping vi.clearAllTimers() and the existing mocks unchanged.
  - Staged the corrected jsdom setup file (git add src/testing/setup.ts).

- Most recent commit
  - git commit -m "fix: remove invalid cleanup import and use manual DOM cleanup in jsdom setup"

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

<scratchpad>
We need to give exactly one actionable first step: modify tests/testing/helpers.test.ts to remove the trailing .ts in the import path.

The agent can run one command. Use a POSIX sed in-place replacement that updates the import path. That is safe (single-file), idempotent, and minimal.

Command:
sed -i 's|../../src/testing/helpers.ts|../../src/testing/helpers|' tests/testing/helpers.test.ts

This meets constraints: one file modified, one command to run. Do not include commit/push here.
</scratchpad>

Action (one command to run):

Run this in the project root to update the import path in tests/testing/helpers.test.ts:

sed -i 's|../../src/testing/helpers.ts|../../src/testing/helpers|' tests/testing/helpers.test.ts
---

**This was the result:**
---
`bash -lc sed -i 's|../../src/testing/helpers.ts|../../src/testing/helpers|' tests/testing/helpers.test.ts` failed.
Error:
bash process exited with code 1
stdout: 
stderr: sed: 1: "tests/testing/helpers.t ...": undefined label 'ests/testing/helpers.test.ts'
