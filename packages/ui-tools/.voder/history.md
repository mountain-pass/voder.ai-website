History of work completed so far

- Repository scaffold and metadata
  - Initialized the repository with .voder metadata, progress logs/chart, docs/decisions, and symlinks for decision docs and prompts/docs.
  - Performed frequent stash/restore cycles and scanned for secrets (none found).

- package.json and publishing setup
  - Iteratively updated root and package package.json fields and scripts; preserved prepared/.voder fields where possible.
  - Added top-level main/types/exports for packages/ui-tools v1.0.0 (private, ESM) and removed nested "types" under "exports".
  - Committed package.json and package-lock.json updates.

- packages/ui-tools implementation
  - Added PostCSS helper (src/build/postcss.ts) with ESM autoprefixer import and a default browsers list.
  - Added Vite library config helper (src/build/vite-library.ts) — ESM-only, merges PostCSS, supports entry/externals/CSS extraction, and allows Vite overrides.
  - Exposed createViteLibraryConfig via src/index.ts public barrel.
  - Added packages/ui-tools/README.md.

- TypeScript and build configuration
  - Switched TypeScript to NodeNext, target ES2022, enabled declarations, and adjusted outDir/dist exclusions.
  - Recorded an ADR accepting devDependency decisions for ui-tools (accepted 2025-08-21).

- Toolchain and dependencies
  - Installed and committed dev/tooling dependencies (typescript; vitest@3.2.4; @vitest/coverage-v8; @types/node; postcss; autoprefixer; @testing-library/dom; jest-axe; markdownlint-cli2; later jsdom@^26.0.0 and @testing-library/jest-dom).
  - Ran npm audit across ~321 dependencies with zero reported vulnerabilities.

- Testing infrastructure and tests
  - Added Vitest tests (postcss, package-structure, smoke, vite-library) and adjusted imports for ESM resolution.
  - Implemented jsdom test environment setup (src/testing/setup.ts) that imports @testing-library/jest-dom, performs per-test cleanup, clears timers, and mocks matchMedia, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver.
  - Added tests/testing/setup.test.ts to assert the setup does not throw.
  - Implemented testing helpers (src/testing/helpers.ts) with utilities (renderComponent, waitForAnimation, waitForNextFrame, simulateClick, simulateKeypress) and added unit tests for them.

- Test/build runs and iterative fixes
  - Repeatedly ran and fixed issues across type-check, build, and tests until tsc --noEmit, full tsc builds, and vitest runs passed at various points.
  - Fixed a Vitest/Vite ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND caused by an optional Vite plugin in a generated vite.config.ts by replacing it with a guarded vite.config.ts that dynamically imports the optional plugin and exports an async Vite config with a safe plugins array.
  - Resolved TypeScript errors (e.g., TS2339, TS2367) using runtime guards/casts and targeted single-file test edits to satisfy tsc without broad structural changes.
  - After fixes, npm run build, npm run type-check, and vitest had passed in verification runs.

- Git hygiene and repository maintenance
  - Extensive stash/restore cycles, index adjustments, many add/commit/push actions.
  - Attempted to remove tracked dist/ files and persist/untrack .voder metadata; ran git rm --cached -r .voder and added .voder/ to .gitignore.
  - Made a repository hygiene commit (b2e7fb8) that set pretest to run build and attempted to untrack .voder/dist.

- Notable commits (examples)
  - dfac0ff — ignore .voder metadata
  - 8c0de2a — untrack .voder metadata from index
  - b2e7fb8 — repository hygiene
  - e31d0b9 — exposed createViteLibraryConfig in public barrel
  - f942847 — test: add jsdom test environment setup and unit test
  - 129f65d — docs: add README (packages/ui-tools/README.md)
  - acf418e — feat: add testing helpers (packages/ui-tools/src/testing/helpers.ts)
  - 5fb16ea — test: add testing helpers unit tests (packages/ui-tools/tests/testing/helpers.test.ts)

- Key files created/edited
  - src/build/vite-library.ts, src/build/postcss.ts
  - package-level tsconfig adjustments (NodeNext, ES2022, declarations)
  - guarded vite.config.ts
  - src/testing/setup.ts, tests/testing/setup.test.ts
  - src/index.ts (public barrel)
  - src/testing/helpers.ts
  - packages/ui-tools/README.md
  - packages/ui-tools/tests/testing/helpers.test.ts

- Branch and push status
  - Work performed on main; recent activity (including testing helpers) pushed to origin/main.

- Most recent verification run and result (recorded in .voder/history.md)
  - Command run: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test
  - Result: failed with exit code 2.
  - TypeScript errors reported (at that time):
    - src/testing/setup.ts(2,10): TS2305: Module '"@testing-library/dom"' has no exported member 'cleanup'.
    - tests/testing/helpers.test.ts(7,8): TS5097: An import path can only end with a '.ts' extension when 'allowImportingTsExtensions' is enabled.
    - tests/testing/setup.test.ts(2,43): TS5097: An import path can only end with a '.ts' extension when 'allowImportingTsExtensions' is enabled.

- Most recent file edits and staging
  - Updated src/testing/setup.ts to remove the named import cleanup from '@testing-library/dom' and replaced the cleanup() call with an explicit DOM cleanup loop that removes all children of document.body; retained vi.clearAllTimers() and existing mocks.
  - Staged the corrected jsdom setup file (git add src/testing/setup.ts).

- Most recent commit and push
  - Commit: [main f837923] fix: remove invalid cleanup import and use manual DOM cleanup in jsdom setup — 1 file changed, 7 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
  - git push origin main completed (remote synchronized).

- Most recent attempted action and result
  - Executed an in-place sed replacement intended to update an import path in tests/testing/helpers.test.ts; it failed with a sed error:
    - stderr: sed: 1: "tests/testing/helpers.t ...": undefined label 'ests/testing/helpers.test.ts'

- Most recent executed git commit
  - git commit -am "chore: persist intended .gitignore change" completed:
    - [main 714ddd1] chore: persist intended .gitignore change
    - 5 files changed, 322 insertions(+), 348 deletions(-)

- Most recent verification command output (final observed failure)
  - The command npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test failed with:
    - tsc --noEmit reporting TS5097 errors:
      - tests/testing/helpers.test.ts(7,8): import path ending with '.ts' extension error.
      - tests/testing/setup.test.ts(2,43): import path ending with '.ts' extension error.
  - The bash process exited with code 2; stdout/stderr from that run were recorded.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

<scratchpad>
We need to change a single import line in tests/testing/helpers.test.ts to remove the ".ts" extension so TypeScript tsc doesn't complain (TS5097). Only one file edit allowed. Provide exact patch. No commands to run.
</scratchpad>

Edit file: tests/testing/helpers.test.ts

Replace this import block:
import {
  renderComponent,
  simulateClick,
  waitForNextFrame,
  waitForAnimation
} from '../../src/testing/helpers.ts';

With this (removed ".ts"):
import {
  renderComponent,
  simulateClick,
  waitForNextFrame,
  waitForAnimation
} from '../../src/testing/helpers';

Make no other changes.
