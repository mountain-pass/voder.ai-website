Summary of work completed so far

- Repository ignores
  - Added a comprehensive .gitignore for Node build outputs/caches, temp/log files, editor/OS artifacts, .env secrets, and build/test variants.
  - Added .voderignore to keep large directories ignored while exposing selected artifacts to the LLM inspector (!dist/, !coverage/lcov-report/, !build/types/).

- Initial scaffold & metadata
  - Created initial scaffold commit on main (5234902) with package scaffolding, multiple .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs), docs/decisions (including symlinked decision docs), symlinked prompts/docs, and packages/ui-tools package files. (24 files changed, ~3,331 insertions.)

- package.json / scripts edits
  - Multiple commits adjusting package.json scripts, toggling prepare and restoring standard dev/test scripts while preserving prepare and voder fields (notably commit 6278399).

- .voder metadata lifecycle and workflow
  - Extensive local edits to .voder metadata using stashes and filtered stashes, resolving pathspec errors, and using git ls-files + git restore to idempotently restore tracked .voder paths.
  - Persisted .voder metadata across commits: 1802445; a large update da44748 (18 files changed, 853 insertions, 1,219 deletions); and 8b5bcc0 (7 files changed, 454 insertions, 347 deletions).

- Source additions & public exports
  - Added packages/ui-tools/src/build/postcss.ts implementing PostCSSConfigOptions and createPostCSSConfig (ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, default browsers list).
  - Added public export barrel at packages/ui-tools/src/index.ts exporting createPostCSSConfig and PostCSSConfigOptions (commit 8c4e390).

- TypeScript config & ADR
  - Added packages/ui-tools/tsconfig.json (ES2022/ESNext target, NodeNext resolution, strict settings, declaration output) (commit 4e74df7).
  - Added ADR documenting devDependency decisions at packages/ui-tools/docs/decisions/0002-add-dev-deps-for-ui-tools.md (accepted, 2025-08-21) (commit afbbe30).

- Repo state, pushes, and notable commits
  - Observed various working-tree states (unstaged/modified files, deleted/modified prompt files, untracked files); repo was at times ahead of origin/main by two commits.
  - Finalized staged package metadata in commit 207ad8a ("chore(ui-tools): finalize staged package metadata") — 2 files changed, 2,352 insertions, 272 deletions.
  - Executed pushes to origin/main after staging and committing package metadata and other changes.

- Developer toolchain installs
  - Ran non-interactive npm install adding devDependencies: typescript, vitest@3.2.4, @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4, @types/node, postcss, autoprefixer, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2 — added 152 packages and updated 2 packages.
  - Later installed jsdom@^26.0.0 with npm install --no-audit --no-fund --save-dev.

- Test creation and .gitignore conflict
  - Created packages/ui-tools/tests/build/postcss.test.ts (Vitest unit test for createPostCSSConfig).
  - Initial git add/commit failed because tests/build was ignored by .gitignore; the test was force-added and committed in commit 1d761f9 ("test(ui-tools): add PostCSS factory unit test") — 1 file changed, 11 insertions.

- Dependency / lockfile commit
  - Staged and committed root package.json and package-lock.json dependency/lockfile changes in commit 3943c9d ("chore(ui-tools): record dependency/lockfile changes") — 2 files changed, 49 insertions, 44 deletions.

- Most recent .voder persistence and push
  - Committed modified tracked .voder metadata files (commit 8b5bcc0) and pushed local commits to origin/main.
  - Most recent action produced commit df1fc64 ("chore(ui-tools): persist .voder metadata updates") — 7 files changed, 361 insertions, 373 deletions.

- Latest run and failure
  - Ran from repository root: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test
  - Command failed with exit code 2. tsc reported: tsconfig.json(4,15): error TS5110: Option 'module' must be set to 'NodeNext' when option 'moduleResolution' is set to 'NodeNext'.

- Fix applied to root tsconfig.json
  - Edited the root tsconfig.json to set compilerOptions.module to "NodeNext" using a non-interactive node command; staged the modified tsconfig.json with git add tsconfig.json.

- Most recent commit
  - Committed the staged tsconfig.json change:
    - git commit -m "fix(ui-tools): align tsconfig.module with moduleResolution (NodeNext)"
    - Result: [main 3f7cd75] fix(ui-tools): align tsconfig.module with moduleResolution (NodeNext) — 1 file changed, 6 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-).

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Run this command from the project root to push local commits and synchronize the main branch with the remote:

git push origin main

**This was the result:**
---
`git push origin main` completed.
