Summary of work completed so far

- Repository housekeeping and metadata
  - Added comprehensive .gitignore and .voderignore; deduplicated .gitignore in-place using awk.
  - Created initial scaffold on main with package scaffolding and multiple .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs).
  - Added docs/decisions (including symlinked decision docs), symlinked prompts/docs, and used stashes/filtered stashes and git-file restores to manage .voder edits.

- Package scaffold and package.json adjustments
  - Iteratively adjusted root and package package.json fields and scripts while preserving prepared and .voder fields.
  - Added top-level main/types/exports for @voder/ui-tools v1.0.0 (private, "type": "module").
  - Removed a nested "types" under "exports" to avoid exposing .d.ts files (commit: "fix: align package.json exports with dist artifacts (avoid .d.ts in exports)").

- packages/ui-tools implementation
  - Implemented packages/ui-tools/src/build/postcss.ts exporting createPostCSSConfig and PostCSSConfigOptions (ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, default browsers list).
  - Added public export barrel at packages/ui-tools/src/index.ts and packages/ui-tools/tsconfig.json (ES2022/ESNext, NodeNext resolution, strict, declarations).
  - Added a guarded packages/ui-tools/vite.config.ts to avoid optional plugin import failures during test startup.

- TypeScript configuration and ADR
  - Switched root tsconfig.json.module to "NodeNext" to resolve TS5110 and allow type-check/build to complete.
  - Added an ADR documenting devDependency decisions for ui-tools (accepted 2025-08-21).

- Toolchain and dependencies installed
  - Installed devDependencies non-interactively: typescript, vitest@3.2.4, @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4, @types/node, postcss, autoprefixer, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2 (152 packages added, 2 updated).
  - Later added jsdom@^26.0.0 and @testing-library/jest-dom (8 packages).
  - Committed package.json and package-lock.json changes.

- Tests and test infrastructure
  - Added Vitest tests:
    - packages/ui-tools/tests/build/postcss.test.ts.
    - packages/ui-tools/tests/package-structure.test.ts (validates package.json exports point to existing dist files and do not expose .ts/.d.ts paths).
  - package-structure.test.ts surfaced the exports/.d.ts exposure issue, which was fixed by editing package.json.

- Build, type-check, and test runs
  - Completed type-check and build after switching to NodeNext.
  - Repeatedly ran the verification pipeline (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) and resolved failures as they arose.
  - Fixed failing package-structure assertion by removing the nested "types" property under exports.

- Vitest startup issue and mitigation
  - Encountered Vitest startup failure (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for 'vite-plugin-inline-source') caused by a generated node_modules/.vite-temp/vite.config.ts referencing a plugin present only in .voder metadata.
  - Mitigated by adding a guarded vite.config.ts that dynamically attempts to import the optional plugin, swallows import/init errors, and exports an async Vite config with an empty-or-populated plugins array.

- Miscellaneous git operations
  - Repeated git index adjustments and add/commit/push cycles (including attempted git rm --cached -r dist/ where no tracked dist paths existed).
  - Installed @testing-library/jest-dom, stashed local .voder edits, and pushed local commits on main to origin.
  - Dedupe .gitignore committed; overall commit reported 10 files changed, 517 insertions(+), 379 deletions(-).

- Recent verification and test results
  - Last verification run (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test):
    - Type-check: tsc --noEmit completed.
    - Build: tsc -p tsconfig.json completed.
    - Tests (vitest v3.2.4) under packages/ui-tools: 2 test files, 2 tests — both passed (package-structure.test.ts and build/postcss.test.ts).
    - Test run duration ~410ms.

- Most recent commits and file additions
  - Committed deduplicated .gitignore.
  - Added and committed a PostCSS usage doc (symlinked) at packages/ui-tools/docs/libraries/usage/postcss.md (commit main 0713db7).

- Most recent actions and stash activity
  - git push origin main completed.
  - Ran: git stash push -m "wip: stash .voder metadata before verification" -- .voder — saved working directory and index state.

- Most recent shell commands and outcomes
  - Executed: git rm --cached -r dist/ || true — completed; no tracked dist paths were present.
  - Dedupe .gitignore with awk — completed successfully.

- Most recent commit attempt and result
  - Executed: git commit -m "chore: stop tracking built artifacts (dist/)" || true
  - Result: The command completed but reported no changes added to commit. Working tree showed several modified .voder files:
    - Modified (not staged): .voder/history.md, .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md, .voder/progress-chart.png, .voder/progress-log-areas.csv, .voder/progress-log.csv
  - Also showed untracked files outside the repository root (e.g., ../services/docs/libraries/usage/, ../services/package-lock.json, ../services/prompts/runtime-ui-testing.md, ../../prompts/development/ui-tools/).

This captures the history of what has been done so far, including recent verification, test results, git operations, and the latest commit attempt outcome.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Action: discard local edits in the workspace-internal metadata directory (.voder/) to clean the working tree.

Command (run from the project root):
git restore .voder/ || true
---

**This was the result:**
---
`git restore .voder/` completed.
Output:

---
