Summary of work completed so far

- Added a comprehensive .gitignore to exclude Node build outputs/caches, temp/log files, editor/tool and OS artifacts, secrets (.env), and build/test variants while keeping package.json and lockfiles tracked.

- Created .voderignore that exposes specific artifacts to the LLM inspector (!dist/, !coverage/lcov-report/, !build/types/) and keeps large dirs (e.g., node_modules/) ignored; the file was echoed into the repo.

- Made the initial scaffold commit on main (commit 5234902): added package scaffolding, many .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs, .voderignore), docs/decisions (including symlinked decision docs), symlinked prompts/docs, and packages/ui-tools/package.json and package-lock.json (24 files changed, ~3,331 insertions).

- Ran non-interactive Node one-liners to update package.json in-place in multiple steps, e.g., setting package.scripts.prepare to a no-op when ../../setup-package-docs.js did not exist and later replacing the root "scripts" section with standard type-check/build/test/clean scripts while preserving prepare and voder fields.

- Committed and pushed .voder tracking updates (example commit c7fe9bb) and recorded multiple additional .voder metadata commits (examples: ee49965, 76f67ed, abc228f).

- Implemented packages/ui-tools/src/build/postcss.ts: added PostCSSConfigOptions interface and createPostCSSConfig function with ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, default browsers list, and plugins array; the file was written to the repo.

- Added a minimal public export barrel at packages/ui-tools/src/index.ts exporting createPostCSSConfig and PostCSSConfigOptions from './build/postcss.js' (commit 8c4e390).

- Performed numerous stash operations and manipulations around .voder metadata: stashed local .voder changes, restored/applied stashes, attempted add/commit, dropped stashes, and handled the repo being ahead of origin/main by two commits at one point.

- Captured repo status showing unstaged modified files, deleted and modified prompt files, modified setup files, and several untracked files (including packages/services docs and package-lock.json).

- Created a filtered stash to save non-.voder changes (saving all changed files except .voder paths), encountered a pathspec error when restoring .voder metadata for packages/ui-tools/.voder/, and then performed an idempotent restore of tracked .voder paths via git ls-files and git restore.

- Persisted and pushed .voder metadata in commit 1802445 (added/updated .voder files, pushed to origin/main).

- Added packages/ui-tools/tsconfig.json via a POSIX heredoc with compilerOptions targeting ES2022/ESNext, NodeNext resolution, strict settings, declaration output to dist, and includes ["src","tests","prettier.config.ts"]; staged and committed in commit 4e74df7 ("chore(ui-tools): add tsconfig for build and tests").

- Created an ADR documenting devDependency decisions at packages/ui-tools/docs/decisions/0002-add-dev-deps-for-ui-tools.md (status: accepted, date: 2025-08-21); added, committed and pushed in commit afbbe30 ("chore(ui-tools): add ADR for devDependencies").

- Most recent file change and commit: staged and committed the modified package.json with the message "chore(ui-tools): restore dev/test scripts" (commit 6278399). Git output: "[main 6278399] chore(ui-tools): restore dev/test scripts â€” 1 file changed, 7 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)".
