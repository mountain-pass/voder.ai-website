Summary of work completed so far

- Repository & metadata
  - Created repository scaffold and multiple .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs).
  - Added and deduplicated .gitignore and .voderignore entries.
  - Added docs/decisions and symlinks for decision docs and prompts/docs.
  - Performed repeated stash/restore cycles for .voder files, created a dedicated stash for .voder metadata, and made multiple non-interactive metadata commits.
  - Persisted run history and verification output to packages/ui-tools/.voder/history.md.

- Package scaffolding & package.json
  - Iteratively adjusted root and package package.json fields and scripts while preserving prepared/.voder fields.
  - Added top-level main/types/exports for @voder/ui-tools v1.0.0 (private, "type": "module") and removed nested "types" under "exports".
  - Committed package.json and package-lock.json updates.

- packages/ui-tools implementation
  - Implemented src/build/postcss.ts (createPostCSSConfig, PostCSSConfigOptions) with ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, and a default browsers list.
  - Added public export barrel (src/index.ts).
  - Added package tsconfig.json and a guarded vite.config.ts to avoid optional-plugin import failures.
  - Added PostCSS usage documentation.

- TypeScript configuration & ADR
  - Switched root tsconfig.json.module to "NodeNext" to resolve TS5110 and enable type-check/build.
  - Updated target to ES2022, enabled declaration output, set outDir to dist, and excluded dist from compilation.
  - Added an ADR documenting devDependency decisions for ui-tools (accepted 2025-08-21).

- Toolchain & dependencies
  - Installed devDependencies non-interactively: typescript; vitest@3.2.4; @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4; @types/node; postcss; autoprefixer; @testing-library/dom; jest-axe; markdownlint-cli2; later jsdom@^26.0.0 and @testing-library/jest-dom.
  - Committed dependency changes.
  - Ran npm audit from project root: 321 total dependencies (14 prod, 261 dev, 48 optional) with zero reported vulnerabilities.

- Tests & test infrastructure
  - Added Vitest tests: tests/build/postcss.test.ts, tests/package-structure.test.ts, tests/smoke.test.ts.
  - Iteratively adjusted smoke test imports for ESM resolution (compiled entry → source → explicit .js extension).
  - Fixed an exports/.d.ts issue surfaced by package-structure.test.ts.

- Build, type-check & verification pipeline
  - Repeatedly ran verification pipeline (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test), addressed failures, and achieved successful runs: tsc --noEmit succeeded; full tsc build succeeded; Vitest tests passed.

- Vitest startup issue & mitigation
  - Encountered Vitest startup failure (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND) caused by an optional Vite plugin referenced by a generated vite.config.ts.
  - Mitigated by introducing a guarded vite.config.ts that dynamically imports the optional plugin and exports an async Vite config with a safe plugins array.

- Git activity & notable commits
  - Performed repeated git index adjustments, stash/restore cycles, add/commit/push activity, and removed tracked dist/ files where relevant.
  - Persisted .voder metadata updates across multiple commits.
  - Notable commits:
    - 05a04a6 — test: import from src in smoke test so type-check can resolve module
    - 4709f47 — test: use explicit .js extension for ESM import in smoke test
    - 9773bcf — chore: persist .voder metadata updates
    - ad437db — chore: persist .voder metadata updates (most recent recorded)

- Recent verification outcomes & final recorded actions
  - Most recent combined verification run completed successfully: tsc --noEmit succeeded; tsc build succeeded; vitest v3.2.4 ran 3 test files and all tests passed (package-structure, smoke, build/postcss).
  - Last staged action before final commit: git add .voder (staged .voder metadata).
  - Most recent Git commit: "chore: persist .voder metadata updates" -> [main ad437db].
  - Final git push to origin main executed after the most recent successful verification.

- Most recent executed action and its result
  - Attempted to untrack all files under dist/ with git rm --cached -r dist/; command failed with exit code 128 and stderr: "fatal: pathspec 'dist/' did not match any files".

- Recent commands & outputs
  - git status --porcelain (captured the working-tree lines above).
  - git diff -- packages/ui-tools/.voder || true (completed; no diff output).
  - Appended four ignore patterns to .gitignore and committed (commit [main 56a64a8] chore: ignore generated docs/scaffolding — reported as 8 files changed, 372 insertions(+), 305 deletions(-)).
  - git push origin main (push succeeded).

- Most recent executed action (unstage package-internal metadata)
  - Ran git restore --staged 'packages/ui-tools/.voder/*' || true; command completed with no additional output.

- Most recent executed action overall
  - Ran git add -A from project root to stage all current changes; git add -A completed.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Revert any working-tree edits to the package-internal .voder files so they match HEAD (no changes in working tree for packages/ui-tools/.voder/*):

git restore --source=HEAD 'packages/ui-tools/.voder/*' || true
---

**This was the result:**
---
`bash -lc git restore --source=HEAD 'packages/ui-tools/.voder/*' || true` completed.
Output:
