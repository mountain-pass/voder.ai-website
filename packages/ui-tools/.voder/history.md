Summary of work completed so far

- Repository ignore files
  - Added a comprehensive .gitignore for Node build outputs/caches, temp/log files, editor/tool and OS artifacts, secrets (.env), and build/test variants.
  - Added .voderignore to keep large directories ignored while exposing selected artifacts to the LLM inspector (!dist/, !coverage/lcov-report/, !build/types/).

- Initial scaffold and metadata
  - Created the initial scaffold commit on main (5234902) with package scaffolding, multiple .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs), docs/decisions (including symlinked decision docs), symlinked prompts/docs, and packages/ui-tools package files. (24 files changed, ~3,331 insertions.)

- package.json / scripts edits
  - Multiple commits adjusted package.json scripts, including temporarily toggling prepare and later restoring standard dev/test scripts while preserving prepare and voder fields. Notable commit: chore(ui-tools): restore dev/test scripts (6278399).

- .voder metadata lifecycle and stash workflows
  - Performed extensive local .voder metadata edits, stashed/restored .voder changes, created filtered stashes for non-.voder changes, resolved pathspec errors restoring .voder metadata, and used git ls-files + git restore to idempotently restore tracked .voder paths.
  - Persisted and pushed .voder metadata (commit 1802445).
  - Large .voder update in commit da44748 (18 files changed, 853 insertions, 1,219 deletions); deleted some prompt files and made setup-package-docs.js executable.

- Source additions and public exports
  - Added packages/ui-tools/src/build/postcss.ts implementing PostCSSConfigOptions and createPostCSSConfig (ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, default browsers list).
  - Added a public export barrel at packages/ui-tools/src/index.ts exporting createPostCSSConfig and PostCSSConfigOptions (commit 8c4e390).

- TypeScript config and documentation
  - Added packages/ui-tools/tsconfig.json (ES2022/ESNext target, NodeNext resolution, strict settings, declaration output) (commit 4e74df7).
  - Added an ADR documenting devDependency decisions at packages/ui-tools/docs/decisions/0002-add-dev-deps-for-ui-tools.md (accepted, 2025-08-21) in commit afbbe30.

- Repo state, pushes, and notable commits
  - Observed various working-tree states with unstaged/modified files, deleted/modified prompt files, and untracked files; repo was at one point ahead of origin/main by two commits.
  - Finalized staged package metadata in commit 207ad8a ("chore(ui-tools): finalize staged package metadata") — 2 files changed, 2,352 insertions, 272 deletions.
  - Executed a successful git push to origin/main after staging and committing the package metadata.

- Developer toolchain installs
  - Ran a non-interactive npm install adding devDependencies: typescript, vitest@3.2.4, @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4, @types/node, postcss, autoprefixer, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2 — added 152 packages and updated 2 packages.
  - Later installed jsdom@^26.0.0 with npm install --no-audit --no-fund --save-dev (completed, up to date).

- Test creation and git-ignore conflict
  - Created packages/ui-tools/tests/build/postcss.test.ts with a Vitest unit test importing createPostCSSConfig and asserting the returned config includes plugins.
  - Initial git add/commit failed because tests/build path was ignored by .gitignore; the test was later force-added and committed.

- Commits for tests and dependency lockfile
  - Force-added and committed the ignored test: commit 1d761f9 "test(ui-tools): add PostCSS factory unit test" — 1 file changed, 11 insertions.
  - Staged and committed root package.json and package-lock.json dependency/lockfile changes: commit 3943c9d "chore(ui-tools): record dependency/lockfile changes" — 2 files changed, 49 insertions, 44 deletions.

- Most recent action and result
  - Committed modified tracked .voder metadata files to persist local changes with:
    git commit -am "chore(ui-tools): persist local .voder metadata changes"
  - Result: [main 8b5bcc0] chore(ui-tools): persist local .voder metadata changes — 7 files changed, 454 insertions(+), 347 deletions(-).

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
<scratchpad>
Goal: synchronize local commits on branch main to remote 'origin' by pushing.
Preconditions: run from project root; git is configured with remote 'origin'; non-interactive push.
Effect: publishes local commits (branch is currently ahead by 3) to origin/main so remote matches local.
Command must be POSIX-safe and non-interactive: use git push origin main.
</scratchpad>

Run this from the project root to push local commits to the remote:

git push origin main
---

**This was the result:**
---
`git push origin main` completed.
Output:
