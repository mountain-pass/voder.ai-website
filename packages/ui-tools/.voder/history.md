Summary of work completed so far

- Repository & metadata
  - Created repository scaffold and multiple .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs).
  - Added and deduplicated .gitignore and .voderignore; added docs/decisions and symlinks for decision docs and prompts/docs.
  - Performed repeated .voder edits with stashes/restores; created a dedicated stash for .voder metadata and committed .voder metadata across multiple commits.

- package.json / package scaffolds
  - Iteratively adjusted root and package package.json fields and scripts while preserving prepared/.voder fields.
  - Added top-level main/types/exports for @voder/ui-tools v1.0.0 (private, "type": "module"); removed nested "types" under "exports".
  - Committed package.json and package-lock.json changes.

- packages/ui-tools implementation
  - Implemented src/build/postcss.ts (createPostCSSConfig, PostCSSConfigOptions) with ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, and default browsers list.
  - Added public export barrel (src/index.ts), tsconfig.json for the package, a guarded vite.config.ts to avoid optional-plugin import failures, and PostCSS usage documentation.

- TypeScript configuration & ADR
  - Switched root tsconfig.json.module to "NodeNext" to resolve TS5110 and enable type-check/build.
  - Updated root tsconfig.json (target ES2022, module NodeNext, declaration true, outDir dist) and later added "exclude": ["dist"].
  - Added an ADR documenting devDependency decisions for ui-tools (accepted 2025-08-21).

- Toolchain & dependencies
  - Installed devDependencies non-interactively: typescript; vitest@3.2.4; @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4; @types/node; postcss; autoprefixer; @testing-library/dom; jest-axe; markdownlint-cli2; later jsdom@^26.0.0 and @testing-library/jest-dom.
  - Committed dependency changes.

- Tests & test infrastructure
  - Added Vitest tests:
    - tests/build/postcss.test.ts
    - tests/package-structure.test.ts (validated exports point to existing dist files and do not expose .ts/.d.ts)
    - tests/smoke.test.ts (smoke test importing compiled package entry)
  - Fixed an exports/.d.ts issue revealed by package-structure.test.ts.

- Build, type-check & verification pipeline
  - Repeatedly ran verification (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test), iteratively fixing failures.
  - Achieved earlier successful verification runs: tsc --noEmit, full build, and Vitest tests passing (prior Vitest run reported vitest v3.2.4, 2 test files, 2 tests — both passed).

- Vitest startup issue & mitigation
  - Encountered Vitest startup failure (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for an optional Vite plugin referenced by a generated vite.config.ts).
  - Mitigated with a guarded vite.config.ts that dynamically imports the optional plugin and exports an async Vite config with a safe plugins array.

- Git activity & miscellaneous
  - Repeated git index adjustments, add/commit/push cycles; stashed/restored .voder edits as needed.
  - Removed tracked dist/ files from the index where relevant and committed that change.
  - Committed deduplicated .gitignore, PostCSS usage doc, tests, and .voder metadata updates.
  - Recorded commit messages including "chore: remove tracked build artifacts (dist/)" and "chore: record .voder metadata updates".

- Dependency audit
  - Ran npm audit --json from project root: report showed 321 total dependencies (14 prod, 261 dev, 48 optional) and zero reported vulnerabilities.

- Most recent verification attempt & failure
  - Ran the verification pipeline (type-check, build, tests); the run failed during the build step with TypeScript TS5055 errors: tsc attempted to overwrite files under dist/ that were being treated as inputs (notably packages/ui-tools/dist/src/build/postcss.d.ts and packages/ui-tools/dist/src/index.d.ts).
  - tsc --noEmit passed, but tsc -p tsconfig.json failed; the npm command exited with code 1.

- Actions immediately prior to current state
  - Added "exclude": ["dist"] to root tsconfig.json and committed the change.
  - Stashed .voder changes and committed .voder metadata updates.
  - Executed the verification pipeline (which failed as noted) and pushed changes to origin main.
  - Ran git rm --cached -r dist/; the command completed but returned: fatal: pathspec 'dist/' did not match any files (no tracked dist/ path to remove).

- Most recent executed action & result
  - Executed: git add .voder && git commit -m "chore: record .voder metadata changes" && git push origin main
  - Result: completed successfully. Commit: [main 8d4dbd7] chore: record .voder metadata changes — 7 files changed, 357 insertions(+), 389 deletions(-).

- Recorded failing command run (most recent)
  - Executed the combined verification command and captured output:
    npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr
  - Result: the combined command failed with the TS5055 errors shown above and exited with code 1. The build step produced:
    - error TS5055: Cannot write file '.../packages/ui-tools/dist/src/build/postcss.d.ts' because it would overwrite input file.
    - error TS5055: Cannot write file '.../packages/ui-tools/dist/src/index.d.ts' because it would overwrite input file.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Run this in the project root to run type-check, build, and tests and capture all console output:

npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr

Purpose: verify compilation and tests end-to-end and write console-first output (captured in .voder/history.md). Run the single command exactly as shown from the repository root.
---

**This was the result:**
---
`bash -lc npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr` failed.
Error:
bash process exited with code 1
stdout: 
> @voder/ui-tools@1.0.0 type-check
