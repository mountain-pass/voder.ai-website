Summary — work completed so far

- Repository housekeeping & metadata
  - Added comprehensive .gitignore and .voderignore, deduplicated .gitignore (commit main a909560).
  - Created initial scaffold and multiple .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs).
  - Added docs/decisions (including symlinked decision docs), symlinked prompts/docs, and managed .voder edits using stashes/filtered stashes and git-file restores.
  - Updated .voder metadata (commit main f1181e9).

- Package scaffold & package.json work
  - Iteratively adjusted root and package package.json fields and scripts while preserving prepared and .voder fields.
  - Added top-level main/types/exports for @voder/ui-tools v1.0.0 (private, "type": "module").
  - Removed a nested "types" under "exports" to avoid exposing .d.ts paths (fix committed).

- packages/ui-tools implementation
  - Implemented packages/ui-tools/src/build/postcss.ts exporting createPostCSSConfig and PostCSSConfigOptions (ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, default browsers list).
  - Added public export barrel (src/index.ts), tsconfig.json, and a guarded vite.config.ts to avoid optional plugin import failures during test startup.
  - Added PostCSS usage documentation (packages/ui-tools/docs/libraries/usage/postcss.md).

- TypeScript configuration & ADR
  - Switched root tsconfig.json.module to "NodeNext" to resolve TS5110 and allow type-check/build to complete.
  - Added an ADR documenting devDependency decisions for ui-tools (accepted 2025-08-21).

- Toolchain & dependency installs
  - Non-interactively installed devDependencies (typescript, vitest@3.2.4, @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4, @types/node, postcss, autoprefixer, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2 — 152 packages added/2 updated).
  - Later added jsdom@^26.0.0 and @testing-library/jest-dom (8 packages).
  - Committed package.json and package-lock.json changes.

- Tests & test infrastructure
  - Added Vitest tests:
    - packages/ui-tools/tests/build/postcss.test.ts
    - packages/ui-tools/tests/package-structure.test.ts (validates package.json exports point to existing dist files and do not expose .ts/.d.ts paths).
    - packages/ui-tools/tests/smoke.test.ts (smoke test importing compiled package entry asserting createPostCSSConfig is exported as a function).
  - package-structure.test.ts revealed the exports/.d.ts issue, which was fixed by editing package.json.

- Build, type-check & verification pipeline
  - Completed type-check and build after switching to NodeNext.
  - Repeatedly ran the verification pipeline (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) and resolved failures encountered.
  - Fixed package-structure assertion by removing nested "types" under exports.

- Vitest startup issue & mitigation
  - Encountered Vitest startup failure (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for 'vite-plugin-inline-source') caused by a generated temporary vite.config.ts referencing an optional plugin present only in .voder metadata.
  - Mitigated by adding a guarded vite.config.ts that dynamically attempts to import the optional plugin, swallows import/init errors, and exports an async Vite config with an empty-or-populated plugins array.

- Git activity & miscellaneous operations
  - Performed repeated git index adjustments and add/commit/push cycles, stashed local .voder edits, restored .voder metadata edits, and ran git rm --cached -r dist/ (no tracked dist paths existed).
  - Deduplicated .gitignore using housekeeping commands.

- Recent verification & test results
  - Last full verification run (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) completed successfully:
    - Type-check: tsc --noEmit completed.
    - Build: tsc -p tsconfig.json completed.
    - Tests (vitest v3.2.4) in packages/ui-tools: 2 test files, 2 tests — both passed (package-structure.test.ts and build/postcss.test.ts).
    - Test run duration ~410–566 ms.

- Most recent commits, stash & recorded actions
  - Committed deduplicated .gitignore and PostCSS usage doc; latest committed .voder metadata files (commit main f1181e9).
  - Created and committed packages/ui-tools/tests/smoke.test.ts (commit [main 4e13602] test: add smoke test).
  - Last recorded action before the stash was git push origin main; the push completed.
  - Most recently stashed only changes inside the .voder directory:
    - git stash push --include-untracked -m "wip: stash .voder metadata changes" -- .voder
    - Result: Saved working directory and index state On main: wip: stash .voder metadata changes

- Most recent executed verification command & result
  - Command: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr (run from project root)
  - Result: Completed successfully (tsc --noEmit; tsc -p tsconfig.json; vitest run — 2 test files, 2 tests passed).

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
<scratchpad>
Dist/ is currently tracked in the repository even though .gitignore includes dist/. We need to remove tracked build artifacts from the git index and commit that removal in a single non-interactive command.
</scratchpad>

Run this single command from the project root to remove tracked build artifacts under dist/ from the index and commit the removal (non-interactive):

git rm --cached -r dist/ && git commit -m "chore: remove tracked build artifacts (dist/)" || true
---

**This was the result:**
---
`bash -lc git rm --cached -r dist/ && git commit -m "chore: remove tracked build artifacts (dist/)" || true` completed.
Output:
