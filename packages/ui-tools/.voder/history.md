Summary of work completed so far

- Created and updated ignore files from the project root with a single POSIX command:
  - Added a .gitignore that excludes Node build outputs/caches (node_modules/, dist/, build/, .cache/, .vite/, .nyc_output/, *.tsbuildinfo), temporary/output/log files and directories (*.log, *.txt, *.out, *.tmp, logs/, temp/, tmp/, artifacts/, diagnostics/), editor/tool artifacts (.eslintcache, .vscode/, .idea/, *.suo, *.user, *.swp), OS artifacts (Thumbs.db, .DS_Store), secrets (.env), and some build/test variants (dist-*/, coverage-*/). package.json and lockfiles were intentionally not ignored. A note was recorded that already-tracked sensitive files (e.g., .env) should be removed from the git index before committing.
  - Created a .voderignore that exposes specific build artifacts to the LLM inspector via negations (!dist/, !coverage/lcov-report/, !build/types/), while intentionally not negating large runtime dirs like node_modules/.
  - The command completed successfully and echoed the created file contents.

- Committed the project scaffold and documentation in a single non-interactive commit:
  - Command run: git add . && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): initial docs and package scaffold"
  - Result: commit on branch main (5234902), 24 files changed, 3,331 insertions(+).
  - Files created in that commit included package scaffolding and many .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs, .voderignore), docs/decisions and several symlinked decision docs, symlinked prompts and docs, and packages/ui-tools/package.json and package-lock.json.

- Executed a Node one-liner to update package.json:
  - The script read package.json and, if ../../setup-package-docs.js did not exist, set package.scripts.prepare to a no-op ('echo "prepare skipped"') and wrote the modified package.json. The command executed and completed.

- Most recent commit and push involving .voder files:
  - Command run: git add .voder && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): update voder tracking files" && git push
  - Result: [main c7fe9bb] chore(ui-tools): update voder tracking files â€” 7 files changed, 409 insertions(+), 517 deletions(-).

- Added src/build/postcss.ts with a single POSIX command (mkdir -p && cat > ... <<'TS'):
  - The file implements and exports a TypeScript interface PostCSSConfigOptions and a function createPostCSSConfig.
  - Implementation details: uses ESM import of autoprefixer, provides JSDoc, defaults browsers to ['last 2 versions', '> 1%', 'not dead'], allows additional PostCSS plugins via an options.plugins array, and returns an object with a plugins array that starts with autoprefixer configured via overrideBrowserslist and then spreads any additional plugins.
  - The POSIX command completed and wrote the file successfully.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Stage and commit the modified .voder metadata files to produce a clean working tree. Run this from the project root:

git add .voder && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): record voder metadata changes"
---

**This was the result:**
---
`bash -lc git add .voder && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): record voder metadata changes"` completed.
Output:
