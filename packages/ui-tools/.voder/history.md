Summary of work completed so far

- Repository & metadata
  - Created the repository scaffold and multiple .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs).
  - Added and deduplicated .gitignore and .voderignore.
  - Added docs/decisions and symlinks for decision docs and prompts/docs.
  - Repeatedly edited .voder files using stashes/restores; created a dedicated stash for .voder metadata and made multiple non-interactive commits (notable metadata commits: bcb39f4, 937d12f).
  - Persisted .voder metadata updates in non-interactive metadata commits (notably [main 9773bcf] and [main ad437db]).
  - Wrote run history and recent verification output to .voder/history.md.

- package.json / package scaffolds
  - Iteratively adjusted root and package package.json fields and scripts while preserving prepared/.voder fields.
  - Added top-level main/types/exports for @voder/ui-tools v1.0.0 (private, "type": "module") and removed nested "types" under "exports".
  - Committed package.json and package-lock.json updates.

- packages/ui-tools implementation
  - Implemented src/build/postcss.ts (createPostCSSConfig, PostCSSConfigOptions) with ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, and a default browsers list.
  - Added public export barrel (src/index.ts).
  - Added package tsconfig.json and a guarded vite.config.ts to avoid optional-plugin import failures.
  - Added PostCSS usage documentation.

- TypeScript configuration & ADR
  - Switched root tsconfig.json.module to "NodeNext" to resolve TS5110 and enable type-check/build; updated target to ES2022, enabled declaration output, and set outDir to dist.
  - Added "exclude": ["dist"] to root tsconfig.json.
  - Added an ADR documenting devDependency decisions for ui-tools (accepted 2025-08-21).

- Toolchain & dependencies
  - Installed devDependencies non-interactively: typescript; vitest@3.2.4; @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4; @types/node; postcss; autoprefixer; @testing-library/dom; jest-axe; markdownlint-cli2; later jsdom@^26.0.0 and @testing-library/jest-dom.
  - Committed dependency changes.
  - Ran npm audit --json from project root: reported 321 total dependencies (14 prod, 261 dev, 48 optional) and zero reported vulnerabilities.

- Tests & test infrastructure
  - Added Vitest tests:
    - tests/build/postcss.test.ts
    - tests/package-structure.test.ts (validated exports point to existing dist files and do not expose .ts/.d.ts)
    - tests/smoke.test.ts (initially imported compiled package entry; later modified to import source)
  - Fixed an exports/.d.ts issue revealed by package-structure.test.ts.
  - Adjusted tests/smoke.test.ts to import from source and later to use explicit .js extension for the ESM import as required by TypeScript ESM resolution.

- Build, type-check & verification pipeline
  - Repeatedly ran the verification pipeline (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test), iteratively fixing failures.
  - Achieved successful tsc --noEmit runs, full builds, and Vitest tests at earlier points; used verification runs to detect and iterate on issues.

- Vitest startup issue & mitigation
  - Encountered a Vitest startup failure (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND) caused by an optional Vite plugin referenced by a generated vite.config.ts.
  - Mitigated by introducing a guarded vite.config.ts that dynamically imports the optional plugin and exports an async Vite config with a safe plugins array.

- Git activity & miscellaneous
  - Performed repeated git index adjustments, add/commit/push cycles; stashed/restored .voder edits as needed.
  - Removed tracked dist/ files from the index where relevant and committed that change ("chore: remove tracked build artifacts (dist/)"); ran rm -rf ./dist/ when needed.
  - Staged .voder metadata changes and recorded multiple metadata commits, most recently [main ad437db].

- Notable commits and edits
  - [main 05a04a6] test: import from src in smoke test so type-check can resolve module — modified tests/smoke.test.ts to import from ../src/index and assert createPostCSSConfig is a function.
  - [main 4709f47] test: use explicit .js extension for ESM import in smoke test — modified tests/smoke.test.ts to use ../src/index.js.
  - [main 9773bcf] chore: persist .voder metadata updates.
  - [main ad437db] chore: persist .voder metadata updates (7 files changed, 333 insertions(+), 392 deletions(-)).

- Recent verification attempts & outcomes
  - Observed earlier build failures where tsc attempted to overwrite files under dist/ (TS5055) and tests referenced missing compiled outputs; these were iteratively addressed.
  - Most recent combined verification run (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) completed with all steps passing:
    - tsc --noEmit succeeded.
    - tsc build succeeded.
    - vitest run (v3.2.4) ran 3 test files; all tests passed (3 passed).
    - Vitest output showed tests/package-structure.test.ts, tests/smoke.test.ts, and tests/build/postcss.test.ts all passed; total duration 454ms.

- Most recent executed and recorded actions
  - Last executed shell command before the final commit: git add .voder (staged .voder metadata).
  - Most recent Git commit recorded: git commit -m "chore: persist .voder metadata updates" -- .voder -> [main ad437db].
  - Most recently executed verification command: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test — completed successfully with all tests passing.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
<scratchpad>
We need to provide exactly one actionable command: git push origin main.
Must instruct to run from project root and explain goal: synchronize local main with remote.
Do not include any other commands or steps.
</scratchpad>

Run this from the project root to publish your local commits and synchronize with the remote branch:

git push origin main

**This was the result:**
---
`git push origin main` completed.
Output:
