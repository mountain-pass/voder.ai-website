Summary of work completed so far

- Created/updated ignore files with a single POSIX command:
  - Added a .gitignore that excludes Node build outputs/caches (node_modules/, dist/, build/, .cache/, .vite/, .nyc_output/, *.tsbuildinfo), temp/output/log files and dirs (*.log, *.txt, *.out, *.tmp, logs/, temp/, tmp/, artifacts/, diagnostics/), editor/tool artifacts (.eslintcache, .vscode/, .idea/, *.suo, *.user, *.swp), OS artifacts (Thumbs.db, .DS_Store), secrets (.env), and some build/test variants (dist-*/, coverage-*/). package.json and lockfiles were left tracked. A note was recorded to remove already-tracked sensitive files (e.g., .env) from the git index before committing.
  - Created .voderignore that exposes selected build artifacts to the LLM inspector via negations (!dist/, !coverage/lcov-report/, !build/types/) while intentionally not negating large runtime dirs like node_modules/.
  - The command completed and echoed the created file contents.

- Committed initial project scaffold and documentation in one non-interactive commit:
  - Command: git add . && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): initial docs and package scaffold"
  - Result: commit on main (5234902), 24 files changed, 3,331 insertions(+).
  - Files added included package scaffolding, many .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs, .voderignore), docs/decisions and several symlinked decision docs, symlinked prompts/docs, and packages/ui-tools/package.json and package-lock.json.

- Ran a Node one-liner to update package.json:
  - Script read package.json and, if ../../setup-package-docs.js did not exist, set package.scripts.prepare to a no-op ('echo "prepare skipped"') and wrote the modified package.json. The command executed successfully.

- Committed and pushed earlier .voder updates:
  - Command: git add .voder && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): update voder tracking files" && git push
  - Result: [main c7fe9bb] chore(ui-tools): update voder tracking files — 7 files changed, 409 insertions(+), 517 deletions(-).

- Added src/build/postcss.ts via a single POSIX command:
  - File implements and exports a TypeScript interface PostCSSConfigOptions and a function createPostCSSConfig.
  - Uses an ESM import of autoprefixer, includes JSDoc, defaults browsers to ['last 2 versions', '> 1%', 'not dead'], allows additional PostCSS plugins via options.plugins, and returns an object whose plugins array begins with autoprefixer configured with overrideBrowserslist and then spreads any additional plugins.
  - The POSIX command completed and wrote the file successfully.

- Staged and committed modified .voder metadata files:
  - Command: git add .voder && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): record voder metadata changes"
  - Result: [main ee49965] chore(ui-tools): record voder metadata changes — 7 files changed, 474 insertions(+), 380 deletions(-).

- Most recent action (staged and committed three .voder files):
  - Command run: git add .voder/history.md .voder/last-action.md .voder/plan.md && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): record voder metadata changes"
  - Result: [main 76f67ed] chore(ui-tools): record voder metadata changes — 3 files changed, 74 insertions(+), 282 deletions(-).
