Summary of work completed so far (history only)

- Repository housekeeping & metadata
  - Created repository scaffold and multiple .voder metadata files (.voder/file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs).
  - Added and deduplicated .gitignore and .voderignore; added docs/decisions and created symlinks for decision docs and prompts/docs.
  - Managed .voder edits with repeated stashes/restores and committed .voder metadata across multiple commits.

- Package scaffolds & package.json changes
  - Iteratively adjusted root and package package.json fields and scripts while preserving prepared/.voder fields.
  - Added top-level main/types/exports for @voder/ui-tools v1.0.0 (private, "type": "module"); removed nested "types" under "exports".

- packages/ui-tools implementation
  - Implemented src/build/postcss.ts (createPostCSSConfig, PostCSSConfigOptions) with ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, and default browsers list.
  - Added public export barrel (src/index.ts), tsconfig.json, guarded vite.config.ts to avoid optional-plugin import failures, and PostCSS usage documentation.

- TypeScript configuration & ADR
  - Switched root tsconfig.json.module to "NodeNext" to resolve TS5110 and allow type-check/build.
  - Updated root tsconfig.json to target ES2022, module NodeNext, declaration true, outDir dist; included src/tests/prettier.config.ts; later added "exclude": ["dist"].
  - Added an ADR documenting devDependency decisions for ui-tools (accepted 2025-08-21).

- Toolchain & dependencies
  - Installed devDependencies non-interactively (typescript; vitest@3.2.4; @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4; @types/node; postcss; autoprefixer; @testing-library/dom; jest-axe; markdownlint-cli2; later jsdom@^26.0.0 and @testing-library/jest-dom).
  - Committed package.json and package-lock.json changes.

- Tests & test infrastructure
  - Added Vitest tests:
    - tests/build/postcss.test.ts
    - tests/package-structure.test.ts (validated exports point to existing dist files and do not expose .ts/.d.ts)
    - tests/smoke.test.ts (smoke test importing compiled package entry)
  - Fixed an exports/.d.ts issue revealed by package-structure.test.ts.

- Build, type-check & verification pipeline
  - Repeatedly ran verification (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test), iteratively fixed failures until an earlier full verification run completed successfully (tsc --noEmit, tsc -p tsconfig.json, and Vitest tests passing).
  - Prior successful test run: vitest v3.2.4, 2 test files, 2 tests — both passed.

- Vitest startup issue & mitigation
  - Encountered Vitest startup failure (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for an optional Vite plugin referenced by a generated vite.config.ts).
  - Mitigated with a guarded vite.config.ts that dynamically imports the optional plugin and exports an async Vite config with a safe plugins array.

- Git activity & miscellaneous operations
  - Repeated git index adjustments, add/commit/push cycles; stashed and restored .voder edits as needed.
  - Removed tracked dist/ files from the index (git rm --cached -r dist/) and committed.
  - Committed deduplicated .gitignore, PostCSS usage doc, tests, and .voder metadata updates.
  - Recent commit messages include "chore: remove tracked build artifacts (dist/)" and "chore: record .voder metadata updates".
  - Created a stash for .voder metadata: git stash push -m "wip: stash .voder metadata changes" -- .voder.

- Dependency audit
  - Ran npm audit --json from project root; report: 321 total dependencies (14 prod, 261 dev, 48 optional) and zero reported vulnerabilities.

- Most recent verification attempt and failure
  - Executed: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr
  - Result: The run failed during the build step with TypeScript TS5055 errors — tsc attempted to overwrite files under dist/ that were being treated as inputs:
    - packages/ui-tools/dist/src/build/postcss.d.ts
    - packages/ui-tools/dist/src/index.d.ts
  - The npm command exited with code 1. Console excerpt shows tsc --noEmit passed, then tsc -p tsconfig.json failed with the TS5055 errors.

- Actions immediately prior to current state
  - Added "exclude": ["dist"] to repository root tsconfig.json and committed ("fix: exclude dist from tsconfig to avoid build overwriting inputs").
  - Stashed .voder changes and committed .voder metadata updates.
  - Executed the verification pipeline (which failed as noted).
  - Pushed changes to origin main; push completed.

- Most recent git commit & final recorded state
  - Most recent commit recorded: git commit -am "chore: record .voder metadata updates" (shown as [main 0d77a72], 7 files changed, 357 insertions(+), 425 deletions(-) in the final recorded commit sequence).
  - Repository history records work through the most recent failed verification run and the final tracked commit that recorded .voder metadata updates. The most recent git push completed successfully; the most recently executed verification command failed with TS5055 build errors as recorded above.

This summary reflects the completed work and repository state through the most recent recorded commit and verification attempt.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
git rm --cached -r dist/ 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr || true
---

**This was the result:**
---
`bash -lc git rm --cached -r dist/ 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr || true` completed.
Output:
fatal: pathspec 'dist/' did not match any files
