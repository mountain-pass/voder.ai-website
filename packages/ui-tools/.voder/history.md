Summary of work completed so far

- Repository ignores
  - Added a comprehensive .gitignore for Node build outputs/caches, temp/log files, editor/OS artifacts, .env secrets, and build/test variants.
  - Added .voderignore to exclude large directories while exposing selected artifacts to the LLM inspector.

- Initial scaffold & metadata
  - Created the initial scaffold commit on main with package scaffolding and multiple .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs).
  - Added docs/decisions (including symlinked decision docs), symlinked prompts/docs, and a packages/ui-tools package.

- package.json / scripts
  - Multiple commits adjusting package.json scripts, toggling prepare and restoring standard dev/test scripts while preserving prepare and voder fields (notable commit 6278399).

- .voder metadata lifecycle
  - Extensively edited and preserved .voder metadata across many local commits using stashes/filtered stashes and git-file restores to maintain idempotent tracked paths (examples: da44748, 8b5bcc0, and later 9a21545, 744170e).

- Source additions & public exports
  - Added packages/ui-tools/src/build/postcss.ts implementing PostCSSConfigOptions and createPostCSSConfig (ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, default browsers list).
  - Added public export barrel at packages/ui-tools/src/index.ts exporting createPostCSSConfig and PostCSSConfigOptions (commit 8c4e390).

- TypeScript config & ADR
  - Added packages/ui-tools/tsconfig.json (ES2022/ESNext target, NodeNext resolution, strict settings, declaration output).
  - Added an ADR documenting devDependency decisions for ui-tools (accepted 2025-08-21).
  - Edited root tsconfig.json to set compilerOptions.module to "NodeNext" to align with moduleResolution (commit [main 3f7cd75]).

- Repo state, notable commits, and pushes
  - Observed varying working-tree states (unstaged/modified files, deleted/modified prompt files, untracked files); repo was at times ahead of origin/main by two commits.
  - Finalized staged package metadata in commit 207ad8a.
  - Persisted and pushed multiple local commits to origin/main, including large metadata changes (da44748, 8b5bcc0, df1fc64).
  - Committed modified tracked .voder metadata files ([main 9a21545], [main 744170e]) and pushed them.

- Developer toolchain installs
  - Ran non-interactive npm installs adding devDependencies: typescript, vitest@3.2.4, @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4, @types/node, postcss, autoprefixer, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2 (152 packages added, 2 updated).
  - Later added jsdom@^26.0.0 as a devDependency.

- Tests and .gitignore conflict
  - Created packages/ui-tools/tests/build/postcss.test.ts (Vitest unit test for createPostCSSConfig).
  - Initial git add/commit failed because tests/build was ignored; the test file was force-added and later committed in commit 1d761f9 ("test(ui-tools): add PostCSS factory unit test").

- Dependency / lockfile commit
  - Staged and committed root package.json and package-lock.json dependency/lockfile changes in commit 3943c9d ("chore(ui-tools): record dependency/lockfile changes").

- Build run, failure, and fix
  - Ran the type-check/build/test pipeline which initially failed with a tsc error (TS5110: module must be set to NodeNext when moduleResolution is NodeNext).
  - Fixed root tsconfig.module to NodeNext and committed the change; type-check and build then completed.

- Most recent verification pipeline run
  - Executed npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test.
  - Type-check and build completed; Vitest startup then failed with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for package 'vite-plugin-inline-source' (imported from node_modules/.vite-temp/vite.config.ts), preventing tests from running to completion.

- Dependency inspection & repo search for missing plugin
  - Ran npm ls vite-plugin-inline-source --json || true; output showed the package is not listed in the local dependency tree.
  - Searched the repository for references to "vite-plugin-inline-source"; matches were found only inside .voder metadata files (history.md, implementation-progress.md, plan.md, last-action.md). No occurrences found in source files outside metadata.

- Attempts to inspect generated Vite temp config
  - Tried to view node_modules/.vite-temp/vite.config.ts and list the directory; commands produced no visible output.

- Most recent actions
  - Created a guarded vite.config.ts at the project root that dynamically attempts to import 'vite-plugin-inline-source', swallows import/init errors, and exports an async Vite config with the resulting plugins array.
  - Staged the generated vite.config.ts with: git add -- vite.config.ts (command completed).

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
git commit -m "fix(ui-tools): guard optional vite-plugin-inline-source import to avoid test startup error"
---

**This was the result:**
---
`git commit -m fix(ui-tools): guard optional vite-plugin-inline-source import to avoid test startup error` completed.
Output:
