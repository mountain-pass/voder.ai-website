Summary — history of completed work

- Repository housekeeping and metadata
  - Added comprehensive .gitignore and .voderignore.
  - Created initial scaffold on main with package scaffolding and multiple .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs).
  - Added docs/decisions (including symlinked decision docs), symlinked prompts/docs, and persisted multiple metadata commits while using stashes/filtered stashes and git-file restores to manage .voder edits.

- Package scaffold and package.json work
  - Iteratively adjusted root and package package.json fields and scripts, preserving prepared and .voder fields.
  - Added top-level main/types/exports fields for @voder/ui-tools v1.0.0 (private, "type": "module").
  - Removed a nested "types" under "exports" to avoid exposing .d.ts files; committed with message: "fix: align package.json exports with dist artifacts (avoid .d.ts in exports)".

- packages/ui-tools implementation
  - Implemented packages/ui-tools/src/build/postcss.ts exporting createPostCSSConfig and PostCSSConfigOptions (ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, default browsers list).
  - Added public export barrel at packages/ui-tools/src/index.ts and packages/ui-tools/tsconfig.json (ES2022/ESNext target, NodeNext resolution, strict, declarations).
  - Added a guarded packages/ui-tools/vite.config.ts to avoid optional plugin import failures during test startup.

- TypeScript configuration and ADR
  - Changed root tsconfig.json.module to "NodeNext" to resolve TS5110 and allow type-check/build to complete.
  - Added an ADR documenting devDependency decisions for ui-tools (accepted 2025-08-21).

- Toolchain and dependencies installed
  - Installed devDependencies non-interactively: typescript, vitest@3.2.4, @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4, @types/node, postcss, autoprefixer, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2 (152 packages added, 2 updated).
  - Later added jsdom@^26.0.0 and @testing-library/jest-dom (8 packages).
  - Committed package.json and package-lock.json changes.

- Tests and test infrastructure
  - Added Vitest tests:
    - packages/ui-tools/tests/build/postcss.test.ts (initially force-added; later committed).
    - packages/ui-tools/tests/package-structure.test.ts validating package.json exports point to existing dist files and do not expose .ts/.d.ts paths.
  - The package-structure test surfaced the exports/.d.ts exposure issue, which was fixed by editing package.json.

- Build, type-check, and test runs
  - Switched to "NodeNext" and completed type-check and build.
  - Ran the verification pipeline (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) multiple times.
  - Fixed a failing package-structure assertion by removing the nested "types" property under exports.

- Vitest startup issue and mitigation
  - Encountered Vitest startup failure (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for 'vite-plugin-inline-source') due to a generated node_modules/.vite-temp/vite.config.ts referencing a plugin present only in .voder metadata.
  - Added a guarded vite.config.ts in packages/ui-tools that dynamically attempts to import the optional plugin, swallows import/init errors, and exports an async Vite config with a plugins array to prevent optional-plugin import failures during test startup; change committed.

- Miscellaneous git operations
  - Repeated git index adjustments and add/commit/push cycles (including git rm --cached -r dist/ attempts where applicable) to persist metadata and dependency changes.
  - Installed @testing-library/jest-dom, stashed local .voder edits, and pushed local commits on main to origin.
  - Last committed change before the final verification run included creating packages/ui-tools/tests/package-structure.test.ts.

- Most recent verification run and result
  - Command: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test
  - Results:
    - Type-check: tsc --noEmit completed.
    - Build: tsc -p tsconfig.json completed.
    - Tests (vitest v3.2.4) under packages/ui-tools: 2 test files, 2 tests — both passed:
      - tests/package-structure.test.ts — passed.
      - tests/build/postcss.test.ts — passed.
    - Test run summary: 2 test files passed (2 tests), duration ~410ms.

- Most recent git action
  - Executed: git push (from repository root). Result: git push completed.

- Most recently executed command and result
  - Command: git rm --cached -r dist/
  - Result: failed with exit code 128; stderr: "fatal: pathspec 'dist/' did not match any files"

- Last executed check for tracked dist paths
  - Command: git ls-files -- 'dist' 'dist/*' || true
  - Result: completed with no output (no tracked dist paths).

- Most recent repository edit (single-file change)
  - Appended the line "prompt-assets/" to .gitignore to prevent prompt-assets/ from being tracked.
  - Result: patch applied successfully; .gitignore updated (the file now contains the appended "prompt-assets/" entries in multiple sections).

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Run this single command from the project root to remove duplicate lines (dedupe) in .gitignore and replace it in-place:

awk '!seen[$0]++' .gitignore > .gitignore.tmp && mv .gitignore.tmp .gitignore
---

**This was the result:**
---
`bash -lc awk '!seen[$0]++' .gitignore > .gitignore.tmp && mv .gitignore.tmp .gitignore` completed.
Output:

---
