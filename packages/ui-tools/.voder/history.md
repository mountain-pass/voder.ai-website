Summary of work completed so far

- Repository setup and hygiene
  - Initialized repo metadata, docs, progress logs, ADRs, symlinks; added .voder/ to .gitignore. Performed stash/restore cycles and hygiene commits to untrack distribution/tooling files. Ran a secrets scan (no secrets found).

- Package configuration and publishing metadata
  - Iteratively updated root and package package.json files and scripts, preserved prepared/.voder metadata where needed, and added top-level main/types/exports for @voder/ui-tools v1.0.0 (private, ESM). Committed package.json and package-lock.json changes and added lint/format/markdownlint and composite verify scripts to the root package.json.

- Implementations in packages/ui-tools
  - Implemented PostCSS helper (src/build/postcss.ts) using autoprefixer and a guarded Vite ESM-only library config helper (src/build/vite-library.ts) to handle optional plugins without ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND. Replaced src/index.ts with a public export barrel re-exporting build factories, testing & accessibility helpers, and the jsdom test environment. Added README for packages/ui-tools.

- Testing API and helpers
  - Created src/testing/index.ts public testing API barrel and "./testing" export subpath. Implemented accessibility/testing helpers (getAccessibilityViolations, expectAccessible, expectAriaAttributes, expectFocusable, accessibilityTests) and added testing setup, ambient types, and extended expect with jest-axe matchers.

- TypeScript and build configuration
  - Switched to NodeNext resolution, targeted ES2022, enabled declaration generation, adjusted outDir/dist exclusions, recorded an ADR for devDependency choices, and replaced vite.config.ts with a guarded async config for optional plugins.

- Toolchain and dependencies
  - Installed dev/tooling deps (TypeScript, Vitest, coverage tooling, @types/node, postcss, autoprefixer, testing-library, jsdom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2, eslint, prettier, etc.). Ran npm audit (no reported vulnerabilities at that time) and updated jest-axe and axe-core; inspected package-lock and npm ls outputs.

- Testing infrastructure and jsdom environment
  - Added Vitest tests (postcss, package-structure, smoke, vite-library) and adapted imports for NodeNext/ESM. Implemented jsdom test environment setup (src/testing/setup.ts) with per-test and manual DOM cleanup, timer clearing, mocks for matchMedia/IntersectionObserver/ResizeObserver, a guarded Canvas 2D mock, and a defensive TextEncoder.encode wrapper that emits a diagnostic when patched. Removed an invalid named cleanup import from @testing-library/dom and implemented manual DOM cleanup.

- Iterative build/test cycles and runtime fixes
  - Performed repeated tsc, build, and vitest cycles; applied runtime and type fixes until type-check, full build, and tests passed at multiple points. Fixed TypeScript and runtime errors with runtime guards and normalized test imports to .js for NodeNext compatibility.

- Public exports and package-structure tests
  - Added a smoke export test asserting ../src/index.js exposes core API functions and tests/package-exports.test.ts to enumerate package.json "exports", assert exported paths point into ./dist/, reject most .ts source files (with allowed exceptions), and verify target files exist in dist/. Adjusted tests to allow .d.ts files while rejecting other .ts sources.

- Commits and notable repo changes
  - Commit b46c57a added the testing public API barrel and related files. Commit 4a5cbd5 added .markdownlint.json, prettier re-export, deps alignment test, and touched build, test, and config files. Created a repository-root ESLint flat config importing rules from @voder/dev-config/eslint and staged a package-local ESLint config.

- Test runs and verification history
  - Standard verification: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test. Earlier full verifications succeeded; later runs showed failures (package-exports/structure mismatches and accessibility axe violations such as color-contrast, missing-label, landmarks/region), followed by fixes. Multiple test runs emitted the TextEncoder patch diagnostic. Canvas 2D mock initially produced jsdom "Not implemented: HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.getContext" traces; later logs indicated the mock installation succeeded.

- Most recent file edits
  - Finalized src/testing/setup.ts (TextEncoder patch, DOM cleanup, matchMedia/IntersectionObserver/ResizeObserver mocks, guarded Canvas 2D mock). Edited tests/testing/accessibility.test.ts to stop expecting a color-contrast violation in JSDOM while retaining label assertions.

- Most recent verification runs
  - A full pipeline run (tsc, build, vitest) produced: tsc/build succeeded; Vitest ran 10 test files (17 tests): 16 passed, 1 failed (test expecting a color-contrast violation that was not detected). Multiple tests emitted the TextEncoder patch diagnostic.
  - A subsequent npm test (build via tsc, then vitest) ran 11 test files (17 tests) and all tests passed.

- Environment
  - Node v22.17.1 and npm 10.9.2 used.

- Recent config and install actions
  - Generated .markdownlint.json at repo root and created ./prettier.config.js re-exporting @voder/dev-config/prettier. Ran npm ci from repo root and recorded install/prepare steps to .voder/history.md. Executed npm run verify; an earlier verify failed during lint:fix with "sh: eslint: command not found". Installed eslint@^9 and prettier@^3 at repo root, adding ~70 packages.

- ESLint runs, diagnostics, and fixes
  - Ran npm run lint:fix; it initially failed with 46 problems (44 errors, 2 warnings), largely due to parserOptions.project pointing at the repo tsconfig.json causing ESLint to attempt type-aware linting on generated/dist outputs (dist/*, compiled test artifacts, and several config files). ESLint emitted a deprecation warning that ".eslintignore" is no longer supported.
  - Committed a repository-root .eslintignore to ignore dist/, build/, coverage/. Generated tsconfig.eslint.json with include/exclude tailored for ESLint. Replaced eslint.config.js to include a top-level ignores entry excluding generated/build outputs and then compose imported layers from @voder/dev-config/eslint (base, dx, performance).

- Most recent attempted verify and failure
  - Executed npm run verify (type-check, lint:fix, lint:md:fix, format, build, test:ci); it failed with exit code 1 during eslint --fix, reporting 46 problems (44 errors, 2 warnings), primarily parsing errors from files not included in tsconfig.json. ESLint also repeated the ".eslintignore" deprecation warning and reported a deprecation and one unexpected console usage.

- Most recent staged and committed change
  - git add tsconfig.eslint.json was staged. The following commit completed:
    - git commit -m "chore(config): add tsconfig.eslint.json for type-aware ESLint"
    - Result: [main 2b283ea] chore(config): add tsconfig.eslint.json for type-aware ESLint â€” 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+), create mode 100644 packages/ui-tools/tsconfig.eslint.json.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
npx eslint "src/**" "tests/**" --ext .ts,.js --parser-options "project=./tsconfig.eslint.json" --fix || true
---

**This was the result:**
---
`bash -lc npx eslint "src/**" "tests/**" --ext .ts,.js --parser-options "project=./tsconfig.eslint.json" --fix || true` completed.
Output:
