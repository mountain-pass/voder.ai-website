Summary of work completed so far

- Repository & metadata
  - Created repository scaffold and multiple .voder metadata files (file-plan.md, history.md, implementation-progress.md, last-action.md, plan.md, progress-chart.png, progress logs).
  - Added and deduplicated .gitignore and .voderignore.
  - Added docs/decisions and symlinks for decision docs and prompts/docs.
  - Repeatedly edited .voder files using stashes/restores; created a dedicated stash for .voder metadata and made multiple non-interactive commits (notable metadata commits: bcb39f4, 937d12f).
  - Persisted .voder metadata updates in a non-interactive metadata commit [main 9773bcf].
  - Wrote run history and recent verification output to .voder/history.md.

- package.json / package scaffolds
  - Iteratively adjusted root and package package.json fields and scripts while preserving prepared/.voder fields.
  - Added top-level main/types/exports for @voder/ui-tools v1.0.0 (private, "type": "module") and removed nested "types" under "exports".
  - Committed package.json and package-lock.json updates.

- packages/ui-tools implementation
  - Implemented src/build/postcss.ts (createPostCSSConfig, PostCSSConfigOptions) with ESM autoprefixer import, JSDoc, and default browsers list.
  - Added public export barrel (src/index.ts).
  - Added package tsconfig.json and a guarded vite.config.ts to avoid optional-plugin import failures.
  - Added PostCSS usage documentation.

- TypeScript configuration & ADR
  - Switched root tsconfig.json.module to "NodeNext" to resolve TS5110 and enable type-check/build; updated target to ES2022, declaration true, outDir dist.
  - Added "exclude": ["dist"] to root tsconfig.json and committed the change.
  - Added an ADR documenting devDependency decisions for ui-tools (accepted 2025-08-21).

- Toolchain & dependencies
  - Installed devDependencies non-interactively: typescript; vitest@3.2.4; @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4; @types/node; postcss; autoprefixer; @testing-library/dom; jest-axe; markdownlint-cli2; later jsdom@^26.0.0 and @testing-library/jest-dom.
  - Committed dependency changes.
  - Ran npm audit --json from project root: reported 321 total dependencies (14 prod, 261 dev, 48 optional) and zero reported vulnerabilities.

- Tests & test infrastructure
  - Added Vitest tests:
    - tests/build/postcss.test.ts
    - tests/package-structure.test.ts (validated exports point to existing dist files and do not expose .ts/.d.ts)
    - tests/smoke.test.ts (initially imported compiled package entry; later modified to import source)
  - Fixed an exports/.d.ts issue revealed by package-structure.test.ts.
  - Earlier Vitest run reported vitest v3.2.4, 2 test files, 2 tests — both passed.

- Build, type-check & verification pipeline
  - Repeatedly ran the verification pipeline (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test), iteratively fixing failures.
  - Achieved successful tsc --noEmit runs, full builds, and Vitest tests at earlier points; used verification runs to detect and iterate on issues.

- Vitest startup issue & mitigation
  - Encountered a Vitest startup failure (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND) caused by an optional Vite plugin referenced by a generated vite.config.ts.
  - Mitigated with a guarded vite.config.ts that dynamically imported the optional plugin and exported an async Vite config with a safe plugins array.

- Git activity & miscellaneous
  - Performed repeated git index adjustments, add/commit/push cycles; stashed/restored .voder edits as needed.
  - Removed tracked dist/ files from the index where relevant and committed that change ("chore: remove tracked build artifacts (dist/)"); attempted git rm --cached -r dist/ (reported no tracked dist/ path).
  - Performed non-interactive commits for .voder metadata changes.
  - Deleted on-disk compiled outputs with rm -rf ./dist/ when needed.

- Notable recent commits and edits
  - [main 05a04a6] test: import from src in smoke test so type-check can resolve module — modified tests/smoke.test.ts to import from ../src/index and assert createPostCSSConfig is a function.
  - [main 9773bcf] chore: persist .voder metadata updates (most recent metadata commit before latest).
  - [main 4709f47] test: use explicit .js extension for ESM import in smoke test — 1 file changed (tests/smoke.test.ts), 1 insertion, 1 deletion.

- Recent verification attempts & failures
  - Observed earlier build failures where tsc attempted to overwrite files under dist/ (TS5055) referencing packages/ui-tools/dist/src/* declaration files; a combined run exited with code 2 and included a tests/smoke.test.ts TS2307 error about missing ../dist/src/index.js.
  - The most recent combined verification run (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) failed with exit code 2.
  - The latest failure reported TypeScript error TS2835 from tests/smoke.test.ts: relative import paths needed explicit file extensions for ECMAScript imports under the current module resolution (suggesting ../src/index.js).

- Most recent actions & results
  - Patched tests/smoke.test.ts to use an explicit .js extension for the ESM import (node one-liner replaced "../src/index" with "../src/index.js"); staged and committed the change: [main 4709f47].
  - Performed git push origin main from the project root; the push completed.

**Most recently we've executed the following action:**

---
Stage the modified .voder metadata files so they can be committed.

Run this command from the project root:
git add .voder
---

**This was the result:**
---
`git add .voder` completed.
Output:

---
