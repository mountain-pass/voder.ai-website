# Implementation Progress Assessment

**Generated:** 2025-08-21T08:17:56.243Z

![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 15.3

<scratchpad>
We must include thought process here per developer instructions. Plan: summarize current state, reference sub-assessment scores, then recommend prioritized next steps focusing on lowest-scoring areas: TESTING (5%), FUNCTIONALITY (12%), EXECUTION (10%), VERSION_CONTROL (25%). The user requested the exact format with IMPLEMENTATION STATUS, OVERALL ASSESSMENT, NEXT PRIORITY.

NEXT PRIORITY should be concrete and actionable, with small incremental steps that follow project's POSIX and console-first policies. We'll propose the minimal vertical slice steps (create src/build/postcss.ts, src/index.ts, tests, tsconfig.json, update package.json scripts, install devDependencies, run type-check and tests, commit and push). Also call out version-control: commit .voder modifications and push. Mention to keep changes small and test after each change. Also recommend moving autoprefixer/postcss into devDependencies for local testing (explain ADR requirement: add ADR later if making them direct dependencies). Mention to make prepare script safe if ../../setup-package-docs.js is missing.

Keep text concise. Provide commands optionally; but earlier guidance says when running commands must be non-interactive. We're not running them, so provide commands as recommended steps. Ensure we do not create files or run commands. Provide final percentages as given.
</scratchpad>

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (28% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What is complete
  - Strong documentation and governance scaffolding exists: ADRs, policy documents, .gitignore/.voderignore, and detailed implementation guides. (DOCUMENTATION: 40%)
  - Package metadata skeleton is present (package.json with name, type: "module", license, peerDependencies and a local dev-config link). (DEPENDENCIES: 40% / SECURITY: 60%)
  - Repository ignore rules and LLM visibility rules are correctly configured.

- What is missing or broken
  - No runnable implementation: core source modules (createPostCSSConfig and other factories), export barrel, templates, and runtime code are not present. This prevents the package from providing the features described in the guides. (FUNCTIONALITY: 12%)
  - No tests installed or runnable: Vitest suites and test configuration are not implemented; coverage and mandatory integration/smoke tests are absent. (TESTING: 5%)
  - Build and execution validation has not been performed: no tsconfig/build/test scripts in package.json and no devDependencies installed. (EXECUTION: 10%)
  - Version control is not clean: there are modified unstaged .voder files and at least one local commit not pushed to origin. Repository is not synchronized. (VERSION_CONTROL: 25%)
  - Dependency layout needs attention: several packages required to implement and test (postcss, autoprefixer, typescript, vitest, testing libraries) are currently only listed as peerDependencies or missing. Decide whether these are peer, dev, or runtime dependencies and record ADRs for any direct dependency changes. (DEPENDENCIES: 40%)
  - Security hygiene items to address (engines policy, audited lifecycle scripts, `.voder` history content scan), though no active exploit found yet. (SECURITY: 60%)

- Reference of the sub-assessment scores (already computed)
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 12%
  - CODE_QUALITY: 30%
  - TESTING: 5%
  - EXECUTION: 10%
  - DOCUMENTATION: 40%
  - DEPENDENCIES: 40%
  - SECURITY: 60%
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 25%

## NEXT PRIORITY
Highest-priority work: deliver a minimal, safe vertical slice so the package can be built, tested, and committed. This addresses the lowest-scoring areas (TESTING, FUNCTIONALITY, EXECUTION, VERSION_CONTROL) and produces immediate, verifiable progress.

Follow these incremental, non-interactive steps (one small change → test/type-check → commit → push):

1) Commit or stash current .voder modifications and push local commits
   - Rationale: Clean working tree and push outstanding commit so remote is synchronized before many changes are made.
   - Actions:
     - Review .voder/* changes for any sensitive content (redact if present).
     - git add .voder/* && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): update voder tracking files" (or revert if they shouldn't be committed).
     - git push
   - Why first: Version-control cleanliness reduces risk and meets project requirement that all changes are committed/pushed.

2) Implement the minimal vertical slice (small, testable feature: PostCSS factory)
   - Files to add (small, focused, one commit):
     - src/build/postcss.ts — implement createPostCSSConfig using autoprefixer (per guide).
     - src/index.ts — export the factory.
     - tests/build/postcss.test.ts — Vitest unit test verifying the config includes autoprefixer.
     - tsconfig.json — minimal TypeScript config including src and tests.
     - Update package.json scripts: add "type-check": "tsc --noEmit", "test": "vitest run", "build": "tsc -p tsconfig.json".
   - Rationale: Provides the simplest fully verifiable API and exercises dependency usage.

3) Add required devDependencies locally (for development/testing only)
   - Minimal set (install non-interactively): typescript, vitest, @types/node, postcss, autoprefixer, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe
   - Note on peer vs dev: For local testing, add postcss/autoprefixer to devDependencies so tests run. If they are intended as peer dependencies for consumers, add an ADR later documenting the decision when you change package.json permanently.

4) Run validation (console-first)
   - Commands to run locally (capture output to console):
     - npm run type-check
     - npm test
   - Iterate on any type or test failures with small fixes. Re-run until both succeed.

5) Commit the vertical slice and package-lock
   - git add src/ tests/ tsconfig.json package.json package-lock.json
   - git commit -m "feat(ui-tools): add minimal PostCSS factory + tests; add tsconfig and test scripts"
   - git push

6) After vertical slice is green, address secondary items in small increments:
   - Implement createViteLibraryConfig and tests.
   - Add testing utilities (jsdom vitest config and minimal helpers).
   - Add standardized scripts (clean, lint, lint:md, format, verify), and then add devDependencies for eslint/prettier/markdownlint-cli2 as required — add ADRs for new direct dependencies as mandated.
   - Add README.md and CHANGELOG.md (consumer-facing docs).
   - Add package-structure and export-equivalence tests (may require a minimal build to dist/).

7) Security/housekeeping steps (in parallel after vertical slice succeeds)
   - Add "engines": { "node": ">=22.6.0" } to package.json (per ADRs).
   - Run npm audit and incorporate audit step in verify script (fail on high/critical).
   - Audit `.voder/history.md` for secrets and redact if needed.
   - Make prepare script safe/no-op until ../../setup-package-docs.js is available or verified.

If you want, I can produce the exact minimal file contents and the precise non-interactive POSIX commands to create them (src/build/postcss.ts, src/index.ts, tests/build/postcss.test.ts, tsconfig.json) and the exact package.json edits. I can also provide the explicit npm install commands to add the minimal devDependencies. Tell me which step you want me to prepare next and I will create the required files and commands in small, testable increments.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (12% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- Implemented / present (what works now)
  - Package scaffold and metadata: package.json exists with name, version, type module, license, description, basic scripts (prepare, voder, build placeholder).
  - Governance and documentation: comprehensive ADRs, decision records, usage docs, prompts, .gitignore and .voderignore are in place and match the project policies.
  - Repository hygiene: .gitignore and .voderignore correctly configured for required patterns.
  - Peer dependency declarations: package.json lists expected peerDependencies for key tools (vite, vitest, jsdom, jest-axe, autoprefixer, postcss).
  - Dev-config linkage: devDependency referencing local @voder/dev-config exists (file:../dev-config), consistent with inherited docs.

- Missing / incomplete (blockers for functionality)
  - Core runtime code: The src/ implementation for the package is missing. None of the mandated source files (src/build/postcss.ts, vite-library.ts, src/testing/*, src/linting/*, utils, index.ts) exist in the tree. Without these, the package provides no usable API.
  - Tests: No Vitest test suites or test harness are present under tests/ — unit, integration, export-equivalence, package-structure, smoke tests required by the guide are not implemented.
  - TypeScript configuration and build: tsconfig.json is missing. No real build pipeline (tsc) or dist/ outputs exist. The package is not compile-able or distributable.
  - Scripts & verification pipeline: Required standardized scripts (type-check, test, test:ci, lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix, clean, verify, dev, etc.) are not implemented (only a build placeholder and prepare/voder stubs exist).
  - DevDependencies: Minimal dev tooling (typescript, vitest, testing libraries, postcss/autoprefixer, eslint, prettier, markdownlint-cli2, @vitest/coverage-v8, etc.) are not installed / declared. The package cannot run tests or type-check without them.
  - Export/packaging strategy: No dist/ outputs, no package.json exports mapping to compiled files, no dual export verification tests.
  - Templates and examples: templates/ directory and example configs (vite/vitest templates) are absent.
  - Mandatory README/CHANGELOG: No consumer-facing README.md or CHANGELOG.md (required per the guide).
  - ADR & dependency policy enforcement: While ADRs exist for many inherited decisions, adding new direct devDependencies would require ADRs as per the governance; current state hasn't added required devDependencies or ADRs for them.
  - Coverage and quality thresholds: Coverage, linting, formatting checks, and minimum thresholds are not in place or verifiable.

- Risk / consequences
  - The package is effectively a documentation scaffold. It does not expose any functional API, cannot be built, tested, or consumed, and therefore fails the core success criteria (implemented functionality, tests, type safety, exports, and tooling).
  - Many mandatory items in the Universal Guide (tests, scripts, exports, tsconfig, dist visibility, verify script) are missing, so automated CI-quality gates would fail.

- Summary judgement
  - The repository contains a thorough specification, ADRs, and scaffold, but virtually none of the actual runtime or test code required by the implementation guide has been created. Functionally, the package does not yet deliver the requested features (PostCSS factory, Vite factory, testing utilities, lint config factories, tests, and scripts).
  - I estimate ~12% complete: documentation and scaffolding are present (~10–15% of the work), but ~85–90% of functional implementation, tests, and verification scripts remain to be done.

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (30% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository currently contains comprehensive documentation and ADRs (good), and .gitignore/.voderignore are well‑formed. However the implementation surface is essentially missing or incomplete: there are no TypeScript source files, tests, or build artifacts present for the package API described in the guides. As a result the codebase is not in a working state and will not compile or run the described functionality.

Major issues and correctness problems
- Missing implementation: The package lacks the described src/ modules (build/postcss.ts, testing helpers, linting factories, etc.). Without those files the package has no runtime API and tests cannot exercise functionality.
- package.json inconsistencies:
  - Scripts required by the Universal Guide (type-check, test, lint, lint:md, format, verify, clean, etc.) are absent or incomplete. This prevents automated validation workflows.
  - devDependencies is just "file:../dev-config" — that local reference is fragile and insufficient for development. Standard dev tools (typescript, vitest, @types/node, eslint, prettier, markdownlint-cli2, etc.) are not present as devDependencies, despite ADRs requiring them.
  - Peer/dependency misplacement: postcss and autoprefixer (and jest-axe, jsdom, vitest) are declared as peerDependencies. If the package implementation will import and call autoprefixer/postcss at runtime (createPostCSSConfig), those packages should be regular dependencies (or at least devDependencies for local testing). Declaring them only as peerDependencies will cause runtime "Cannot find module" unless consumers install them — that contradicts the intended behavior of the package providing those utilities.
  - The prepare script references ../../setup-package-docs.js which may not exist; if run on npm install this will fail. Earlier history indicates a prepare replacement may have been applied but package.json currently shows the original reference.
- Missing TypeScript config and test infra: No tsconfig.json, Vitest configuration, or test scripts currently exist (the planned tsconfig/tests were not applied). That prevents type-checks and test runs.
- Export and packaging strategy not implemented: The repository does not yet implement the dual-export/dist strategy (no dist/ outputs, no package.json "exports" pointing to built files). This prevents package-structure tests and consumer import validation.
- Dependency governance gaps: ADRs say every new direct dependency needs an ADR. Current package.json already includes peerDependencies but no ADRs justifying them for this package; this will be a governance issue later.
- Linting/formatting tooling not present: ADRs and guides mandate Prettier, ESLint flat config, markdownlint-cli2, and scripts for lint:md; those are missing which means code-quality automation cannot run.

Coding standards and maintainability
- Documentation quality is excellent: ADRs and guides are thorough and LLM-friendly.
- package.json metadata uses "type": "module" and license "UNLICENSED" correctly per policy.
- Overall repository hygiene (gitignore, voderignore) conforms to the Universal Guide.
- But implementation-level coding standards (ESM imports with .js extensions in output, strict TypeScript settings, test coverage targets) are not yet applied because there is no source code to review for formatting, typing discipline, error handling patterns, or API surface.

Recommendations (what to fix next, small steps)
1. Add the minimal vertical slice as planned: create src/build/postcss.ts and its export barrel, tsconfig.json, and tests. This will immediately surface type/runtime issues.
2. Move autoprefixer/postcss into devDependencies (for local testing) and into dependencies if the package will import them at runtime — or document why they are peerDependencies with an ADR.
3. Add required devDependencies (typescript, vitest, @types/node, testing libs) and update package.json scripts (type-check, test, test:ci, build, clean, lint:md, lint:md:fix, prepare safe behavior).
4. Ensure prepare script is safe/non-failing or set to a no-op until setup-package-docs.js is present.
5. Implement small unit tests and run tsc/vitest to iterate on type/test fixes.
6. Add ADRs for any new direct dependencies per governance.

Summary
- The repository's documentation and governance artifacts are high quality, but the actual implementation is missing; as a result, the current code is not working and has multiple correctness and configuration issues. The overall code-quality readiness is low (about 30%), but this can be raised quickly by implementing the minimal vertical slice and addressing the package.json/dependency/script issues listed above.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (5% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- There are effectively no runnable tests present in the current repository state. The project contains extensive testing guidance and example test snippets inside documentation/prompts and ADRs, but I do not see actual test files (a tests/ tree with Vitest suites) nor test-related scripts or devDependencies installed that would allow running those examples. package.json currently only has "prepare", "voder", and a placeholder "build" script — no "test" / "test:ci" / "type-check" scripts are present, and there is no tsconfig or test runner configuration committed at the top level. The repo also lacks any coverage artifacts or coverage configuration. Because of that:
  - There is nothing to run, so no test results exist and no passing/failing status can be reported.
  - Coverage is nonexistent (the repo does not meet the documented minimum thresholds).
  - The required mandatory tests per the Universal Guide (smoke tests, export-structure tests, export-equivalence, package-installation integration tests) are absent.

Summary judgement: testing work is at an early placeholder stage (documentation + examples only). The practical testing completeness is near zero (I rate it 5% to reflect that design/examples exist), and coverage is currently not provided at all.

Next obvious step (for the testing track only): add a minimal vertical-slice test implementation (create src/ and tests/ files, add Vitest and typescript devDependencies, add "test" and "type-check" scripts, implement a small unit test and run it) so tests can be executed and coverage measured.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (10% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The package has NOT been run or validated end-to-end. Current package.json only contains a placeholder "build" script and no test/type-check scripts; there is no src/ or tests/ code present, no tsconfig, and required devDependencies have not been installed. No build or test commands have been executed successfully against source code. In short: no compilation, no tests, and the planned validation steps (tsc/vitest runs) have not been performed.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (40% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains useful decision records (ADRs) under docs/decisions/, including a package‑specific ADR (0001-ui-tools-css-preprocessing) and several inherited ADRs. This is a strong point: architectural rationale is well-documented and discoverable.
- There is a usage doc for @voder/dev-config (docs/libraries/usage/voder-dev-config.md) and comprehensive process-level guidance in prompts/universal-guide.md and prompts/development-ui-tools.md. These documents provide excellent high‑level and implementation guidance, but most of that content lives under prompts/ (and one usage doc targets dev-config, not ui-tools) rather than in a public package README or package docs folder.
- Missing a package-level README.md in the package root. There is no consumer-facing README for @voder/ui-tools that is self-contained, shows installation, quick start, API surface, examples, security posture, and licensing — this is required by the project's policies.
- No CHANGELOG.md present. The project template expects a CHANGELOG template and a maintained CHANGELOG in the package root for consumer‑facing release notes.
- No API reference or generated docs (e.g., TypeDoc output or an API.md). The src/ export barrel is defined in the implementation guide, but there is no published API surface documentation (function signatures, options, types) in docs/.
- No concrete usage examples for @voder/ui-tools in the docs/ tree (templates are described in prompts but template files under packages/src/templates are not present in docs). Consumers lack ready examples (vite.config, vitest.config snippets) in a public README or examples folder.
- Test documentation is lacking: there are clear testing requirements in the guides, but no docs describing how to run tests locally for this package (scripts in package.json are minimal). The "how to contribute / develop" steps are not packaged into a README for developers.
- The ADRs and universal guide document many mandatory scripts and linting/formatting requirements, but package.json does not yet reflect those scripts (so the documentation and package manifest are out of sync).
- Markdown linting and documentation standards are well-specified (mandatory rules, use of @voder/dev-config), but there is no generated .markdownlint.json in the repo and no example of the required prepare-script usage—documentation tells you what to do but there is no "runnable" documentation scaffold committed for consumers of this package.
- Good security and licensing guidance appear in the universal guide and ADRs (UNLICENSED requirement and security posture items), but the package lacks a README section that surfaces the security posture and license to consumers.

Summary recommendation (prioritized):
1. Add a self-contained README.md at package root for @voder/ui-tools (installation, quick start, API summary, examples, security, license). This is highest priority.
2. Add CHANGELOG.md (use the template) and a CONTRIBUTING/dev setup section (how to run type-check, tests, build).
3. Publish API reference (handwritten short API pages or generate TypeDoc output into docs/) describing exported factories and option types.
4. Provide concrete examples/templates in docs/ or examples/ (vite.config.ts, vitest.config.ts, test-setup).
5. Align package.json scripts with documented mandatory scripts and add a .markdownlint.json generation example and lint:md scripts.
6. Ensure docs reference only published/consumer-visible artifacts (README isolation rule) and include ADR references where appropriate.

Overall: the repository contains strong policy and ADR coverage (good for internal governance), but is missing the essential consumer‑facing README, CHANGELOG, API docs, and runnable examples — about 40% complete for documentation needs.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (40% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Current package.json lists only peerDependencies (vite, vitest, jsdom, jest-axe, autoprefixer, postcss) and a local devDependency (@voder/dev-config file:../dev-config). Because these are peerDependencies they are not installed in this package and therefore cannot be audited or resolved here — that limits how complete a security/freshness assessment can be.
- Freshness / compatibility observations:
  - autoprefixer ^10 and postcss ^8 are established, well-known versions (PostCSS v8 ecosystem is mature). They are likely compatible with the PostCSS factory described. However newer major releases may exist; caret ranges allow newer compatible minor/patch upgrades but will not pick up breaking major bumps.
  - vite ^6.0.0, vitest ^3.2.0, jsdom ^26.0.0, and jest-axe ^9.0.0 are pinned as caret ranges targeting relatively recent/future major versions. I cannot confirm whether those majors are the latest available or whether known breaking/secure versions exist without querying the registry. Notably ADRs mention exact alignment requirements for vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 — that should be followed when adding the provider to devDependencies.
  - The only devDependency present is a local file reference to @voder/dev-config; there are no networked devDependencies to audit in this package.json snapshot.
- Security vulnerabilities:
  - I cannot definitively say "no significant vulnerabilities" without running `npm audit` or consulting a vulnerability database for the resolved dependency tree. PeerDependencies are not installed here, so `npm audit` run in this package would not show consumer installs.
  - Risk areas to check when you run audit/resolution:
    - Transitive vulnerabilities in vite, postcss, autoprefixer and jsdom ecosystems (these have had advisories historically).
    - Ensure vitest and any coverage provider (@vitest/coverage-v8) are version-aligned per ADR-0005 to avoid runtime/peer errors.
- Practical recommendations (next steps you should run locally — console-first):
  1. Install concrete devDependencies (in a safe environment) or run `npm install` in a consumer project that will actually install the peers, then run:
     - npm audit --json (or npm audit) to list vulnerabilities
     - npm outdated to see newer versions available
  2. If you add @vitest/coverage-v8, follow ADR-0005: install vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 at matching versions and add a small test to validate provider loading.
  3. Consider whether caret ranges are appropriate for each peer: for tight toolchains (vitest/coverage provider) use exact alignment or narrow ranges; for other tools caret ranges are fine.
  4. Add automated SCA (npm audit or other) into the verify pipeline and fail the verify step on high/critical issues per ADR-0007.
- Summary judgment: With only peer ranges declared and no installed dependency tree here, I can only partially assess freshness and security. The declared dependencies appear plausible for the package responsibilities, but you MUST run `npm audit` and `npm outdated` in an environment that installs the peers/devDeps to get a definitive, actionable vulnerability and freshness report.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (60% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary
  - I inspected the repository metadata, documentation, and design/code snippets present in prompts and docs. No compiled code or runtime artifacts are present in the repository root beyond configuration and policy docs. Based on the available source/metadata, there are no confirmed exploitable vulnerabilities in code currently committed, but there are several security-relevant risks and best-practice gaps that should be addressed. My confidence is limited because I cannot (and was not asked to) run dependency analysis (npm audit), static analysis, or dynamic tests—those steps are required to move from an advisory assessment to a concrete vulnerability list.

- High‑priority risks
  1. prepare / voder npm scripts can execute arbitrary code
     - Risk: package.json defines "prepare": "node ../../setup-package-docs.js" and "voder": "node ../../../voder/apps/voder-cli/index.js". npm lifecycle scripts (prepare, preinstall, etc.) run during installs and can execute code on machines that run npm install. If those referenced scripts are added or modified by third parties (or come from a compromised workspace path), they can execute arbitrary code.
     - Recommendation: ensure these scripts point to audited/internal code only, or guard them. If setup script is optional, prefer to avoid running it automatically during `npm install`. Document and audit the referenced files. Add ADR or a check in scripts to ensure expected checksum or content before execution.

  2. No engines constraint (mismatch with ADRs)
     - Risk: multiple ADRs expect Node >= 22.6.0 (for native TypeScript config loading). Without an "engines" entry in package.json, contributors may use older Node versions that behave differently, which can cause tooling to fall back to alternative paths or fail in unexpected ways (potentially causing unsafe fallback behaviors).
     - Recommendation: add "engines": { "node": ">=22.6.0" } to package.json to make the runtime expectation explicit and enforced in CI and by contributors' tools.

  3. Unverified/unstable dependency versions and lack of SCA enforcement
     - Risk: peerDependencies and devDependencies are declared but versions are not locked in code-level (lockfile exists but depends on developer actions). Dependencies such as postcss/autoprefixer/jsdom/vitest can occasionally contain vulnerabilities or be targeted in supply-chain attacks. ADRs indicate a policy for supply-chain audits, but the repository currently lacks automated enforcement (no verify pipeline in the package.json to run audits).
     - Recommendation: run `npm audit` and integrate SCA (automated vulnerability scans) into the verify scripts; pin critical tooling (or use lockfile) and regularly update with ADRs. Consider using tools like `npm ci` in CI and adding verification steps that fail the verify pipeline on high/critical findings.

- Medium‑priority risks
  4. Console-first policy vs tracked .voder files containing historical data
     - Risk: `.voder/history.md` and other `.voder/*` files are tracked and have been modified. They may inadvertently contain sensitive or environment-specific information captured from console outputs (CLI output, command traces, versions, paths). Tracked history files can leak secrets if those were ever printed to console.
     - Recommendation: audit `.voder/history.md`, `.voder/*` and any tracked logs for secrets (API keys, tokens, file paths with credentials). If any sensitive data is present, rotate those secrets and remove/clean the history entries. Consider excluding sensitive artifacts from VCS or redacting before commit.

  5. Child process usage in docs/tests examples (execSync)
     - Risk: example/test snippets use `child_process.execSync` and similar shell commands (e.g., `npm pack`, `npm install` in temp dirs). Tests or helper scripts that build and execute shell commands must sanitize inputs and avoid executing untrusted content. If these tests are run against attacker-controlled input paths, they could execute arbitrary shell commands.
     - Recommendation: when implementing tests and helpers that run shell commands, avoid shell interpolation (use spawn with arg arrays), validate inputs, and keep the commands minimal and deterministic. Restrict the environment and use temp directories created via Node APIs.

  6. Use of external tooling and peerDependencies for consumers
     - Risk: The package relies on consumer-installed tools (eslint, prettier, vitest, markdownlint-cli2). Misalignment or malicious versions in consumers' environments could produce confusing behavior or security regressions.
     - Recommendation: clearly document required peer versions in README and in package.json (peerDependencies). Add automated tests that validate version alignment where critical (already mandated by ADRs) and fail fast if mismatches can cause incorrect behavior.

- Low‑priority / informational issues
  7. jsdom / testing environment limitations
     - Note: jsdom mimics browser APIs but is not a real browser; tests relying on security-sensitive behaviors (like CSP, real rendering) may not reveal real-world security issues. This is not a vulnerability per se but a limitation.
     - Recommendation: for security-critical rendering or behavior, consider supplementing with real browser testing (Playwright) in CI where appropriate.

  8. PostCSS/autoprefixer plugin chain considerations
     - Note: PostCSS and plugins execute code (plugins often export functions). While the provided factory only constructs plugin lists, consumers may pass extra plugins. Loading untrusted plugins is a supply-chain risk.
     - Recommendation: document plugin extension patterns and advise maintainers to vet third-party plugins before adding them. In CI, run audits on plugin packages and limit plugin scope where possible.

  9. No explicit CSP/telemetry/no network assurances in code
     - Note: docs say package should not perform network or telemetry operations at runtime. Ensure no scripts or setup helpers perform network calls during normal package runtime (only dev tooling should).
     - Recommendation: audit any scripts (prepare, voder, setup scripts) to ensure they do not issue network requests or exfiltrate data.

- Immediate actionable checklist (short list)
  - Add "engines": { "node": ">=22.6.0" } to package.json (per ADR).
  - Run `npm audit` and remediate any high/critical findings; add audit step in verify script.
  - Audit `.voder/` tracked history files for secrets; redact/remove sensitive content if any.
  - Avoid auto-running `prepare` unless the referenced file is audited and present; consider making prepare a no-op unless explicitly required.
  - Use lockfiles & enforce `npm ci` in CI; pin or document critical devDependency versions and include ADRs for significant tool changes.
  - Sanitize any inputs to child_process calls; prefer spawn with args arrays over shell interpolation.
  - Add SCA / supply-chain scanning to the `verify` pipeline and document practices for adding dependencies (already in ADRs).

- Coverage/confidence note
  - This assessment is based on repository files, docs, and planned code snippets. I did not run `npm audit`, static analyzers, or runtime tests, and I cannot inspect installed node_modules. For a higher-confidence security review:
    - Run `npm ci` then `npm audit --json` and analyze results.
    - Run static SAST tools and dependency-supply-chain scanners (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk).
    - Audit the contents of any tracked .voder history files for leaked secrets.
    - Verify the actual contents of referenced lifecycle scripts (../../setup-package-docs.js and the voder CLI path).
  - Given these limitations, I estimate this assessment is ~60% complete (±15%). Following the immediate actionable checklist and running automated scans will let us move toward a 90–100% confident security posture.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, synchronized state: there are unstaged/modified files and at least one local commit that hasn't been pushed, so the work is not fully captured or published.
- Uncommitted changes: 7 modified files are present (not staged), specifically several .voder/* files (.voder/history.md, .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md, .voder/progress-chart.png, .voder/progress-log-areas.csv, .voder/progress-log.csv). Because there are uncommitted modifications, the repository cannot be considered complete — this alone limits completeness to at most ~30%.
- Unpushed commits: the branch is ahead of origin/main by 1 commit (local commit not pushed). Unpushed commits mean the remote is out of sync with local work and reduces readiness for publishing/collaboration.
- File tracking and ignore patterns: .gitignore looks appropriate (node_modules/, dist/, build/, coverage/, temp/log patterns, etc. are ignored). There are no untracked important files reported (total untracked files: 0), which is good. Package metadata (package.json) is tracked as expected.
- Clean working state: not satisfied. To reach a high completeness level you must (a) stage and commit or revert the modified files as appropriate, and (b) push local commits to origin. Only after committing all changes and pushing will the repository be in a publishable/synchronized state.

Summary: 25% complete — repository has correct ignore rules and no untracked important files, but uncommitted changes and an unpushed local commit prevent a clean, synchronized version-controlled state.
