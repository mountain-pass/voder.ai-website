![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (55% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- Summary of what's complete
  - A minimal, working nucleus exists: the PostCSS configuration factory is implemented and exported (compiled artifacts in dist/), a small public barrel (src/index.ts) exposes the primary API, and two Vitest checks (package-structure and smoke) validate exports and the compiled entry. The toolchain and dependency choices are modern and aligned (TypeScript, Vitest, jsdom, PostCSS/autoprefixer), and security/supply-chain awareness is addressed by ADRs and audit history.
  - CODE_QUALITY and DEPENDENCIES are relatively strong: code follows ESM/TypeScript conventions and the dependency set is current with no reported vulnerabilities in the recent audit.

- Major things missing / preventing completion
  - Core features from the package spec are not implemented: Vite library config factory, jsdom testing utilities, linting configuration factories, templates, and the mandatory dual-export strategy and related scripts are absent. Tests are extremely limited and do not cover the bulk of required APIs or the 90% coverage requirement.
  - The test surface is sparse: only two small tests exist, and overall coverage is far below policy targets.
  - Execution pipeline is partially broken in the current working tree: the most recent full verification run failed during build with TS5055 overwrite errors (tied to tracked/overlapping dist files).
  - Version control state is not clean or synchronized: there are modified (unstaged) .voder files and at least one local commit ahead of origin/main.
  - Documentation is strong internally (ADRs, internal guides), but there is no consumer-facing README.md, CHANGELOG, nor the full markdown lint generation/scripts required by policy.

- Reference to sub-assessment numbers
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 30% — only a small, useful subset implemented (PostCSS export + minimal barrel).
  - CODE_QUALITY: 75% — good conventions, TypeScript strictness, defensive Vite config; some operational risks (tracked dist, possible missing source file).
  - TESTING: 20% — two small tests exist; coverage and required integration/unit tests are missing.
  - EXECUTION: 70% — previously ran successfully, but latest full verification currently fails due to build overwrite issues.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 60% — excellent internal docs and ADRs; missing README/CHANGELOG/API summary and markdown-lint wiring.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 90% — modern, aligned tool versions; audit reported zero vulnerabilities; minor peer/dev mismatch (jest-axe) to fix.
  - SECURITY: 80% — no direct code vulnerabilities; primary concern is supply-chain and build-time execution of devDependencies (mitigations and ADR exist).
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 15% — unstaged/modified files and an unpushed commit leave the repo unsynchronized and not publishable.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Because the repository must be clean and the verification pipeline repeatable before any feature work continues, the immediate highest-priority actions are:

1) Clean up VERSION CONTROL (urgent — lowest score)
   - Commit or intentionally stash the modified .voder metadata files, or undo them if they were accidental. Then push the pending local commit(s) so the branch is synchronized with origin/main.
   - Confirm working tree is clean (git status shows no modified/untracked project files).
   - Rationale: a clean, synchronized repository is prerequisite for reliable verification runs, reproducible CI behavior, and clear historical context in .voder/history.md.

2) Re-run the full verification pipeline and capture console output:
   - npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr
   - Rationale: this will confirm whether the TS5055 overwrite error still occurs and will populate .voder/history.md with current diagnostics.

3) If the build fails again with TS5055 (tsc attempting to write into dist/ inputs), perform a single focused corrective change (one of):
   - Untrack dist/ and commit that change:
     - git rm --cached -r dist/ && git commit -m "chore: remove tracked dist/ to avoid tsc overwrite"
   - Ensure tsconfig.json excludes dist (add "dist" to tsconfig.exclude) and commit tsconfig change:
     - Update tsconfig.json exclude and commit with a single focused commit.
   - Re-run the verification pipeline after that single change.
   - Rationale: fix the immediate build failure so tests can run from a fresh build.

4) Once the build/test pipeline runs cleanly, address TESTING and FUNCTIONALITY in small, test-driven increments:
   - Add a unit test for createPostCSSConfig (tests/build/postcss.test.ts) asserting autoprefixer presence and default browsers list, commit, then run verify.
   - Implement other missing source modules incrementally (vite-library factory, src/testing/*, src/linting/*) one vertical slice at a time, each time adding tests and re-running verification.
   - Rationale: improve coverage and implement missing features incrementally, ensuring the repository stays green.

5) Align metadata and docs:
   - Fix the jest-axe peer/dev mismatch (update peerDependencies.jest-axe to ^10.0.0) and commit an ADR documenting the change.
   - Add a consumer README.md (use the provided template), add .markdownlint.json generation script / lint:md scripts, and add a CHANGELOG.md.
   - Rationale: satisfy documentation and packaging policies and avoid consumer warnings.

Notes
- Follow the single-change loop: make one small change, commit it, and re-run the verification pipeline; repeat until the pipeline is green and the working tree is clean and pushed.
- Preserve console-first output (use tee) so .voder/history.md captures all diagnostics.
- Do not add features beyond what’s requested in a single change; prefer small, well-tested increments.

Final: Implementation is incomplete (55% ± 5%). The immediate priority is to fix version-control cleanliness and the build overwrite problem so the verification pipeline can run reliably; after that, focus on expanding tests and implementing the remaining package features incrementally.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (30% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Implemented / present
  - Core PostCSS implementation: src/build/postcss.ts is implemented and exported (createPostCSSConfig + types). The compiled dist version and types exist and are referenced by src/index.ts → dist/src/index.js, so the package exposes createPostCSSConfig.
  - Minimal public barrel: src/index.ts exports the PostCSS API; package.json points main/types to dist outputs and exports "." to ./dist/src/index.js — so a consumer can import the primary exposed API.
  - TypeScript build skeleton: tsconfig.json is present, with declaration output, and dist/ contains compiled artifacts for the implemented pieces.
  - Basic verification tests exist: tests/package-structure.test.ts and tests/smoke.test.ts (and compiled equivalents under dist/tests) that validate package.json exports and that the compiled entry exports createPostCSSConfig.
  - Dev tooling and dependency metadata: package.json contains relevant peer/devDependencies and basic scripts (type-check, build, test, clean, prepare).

- Partially implemented / plausible but not fully realized
  - Test infrastructure: Vitest tests for package-structure and smoke are present, but unit tests for the PostCSS transform, Vite factory, testing utils, linting configs, and many other components required by the spec are missing.
  - Build/config templates: vite.config.ts exists (guarded), but the Vite library config factory (createViteLibraryConfig) referenced in the design doc has not been implemented in src/build/vite-library.ts.
  - Dist visibility: compiled artifacts exist for currently implemented items, enabling export checks (good), but build/test cycle has recently hit TS overwrite issues (TS5055) in prior runs — indicates build/test reliability needs attention (not strictly a feature gap, but affects functionality verification).

- Missing / NOT implemented (critical gaps versus the specification)
  - Vite library config factory (createViteLibraryConfig) is not present in src/build; required by the package spec.
  - UI testing utilities: src/testing/* files (vitest-jsdom factory, helpers, accessibility, setup) are not implemented — these are core responsibilities per the package guide.
  - Linting config factories: src/linting/* (HTML/CSS/accessibility) are not implemented in source (only documented in prompts); consumers expect exports for these.
  - Templates: templates/ example config files are not present in the repository.
  - Markdown lint config generator + required lint:md and lint:md:fix scripts are not present in package.json; the mandatory markdown tooling integration is missing.
  - Dual-export strategy / dedicated export paths (./testing, ./prettier, ./eslint, etc.) are not implemented in package.json exports as required for configuration packages.
  - Mandatory scripts per the universal guide (verify, lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix, voder) are incomplete — verify and many lint/format scripts are missing.
  - Prettier configuration (prettier.config.ts) and ESLint configuration files required by the policy are not present.
  - Coverage and quality targets: the spec requires comprehensive tests (export equivalence, package-installation integration tests, smoke tests, package-structure tests) and >=90% coverage on public API — these are not satisfied (only minimal smoke and export-structure tests are present).
  - Documentation: README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and the mandatory ADRs for certain dependency changes expected by the governance are incomplete (some ADRs exist, but not all required by the later plan).
  - Security/packaging rules: dual-export testing and package-installation integration tests are missing, which are required to validate package.json export paths fully in practice.

- Summary judgment
  - The repository contains a correct, working minimal slice: PostCSS config factory is implemented and exported, and there are a couple of verification tests that exercise the compiled entry. This gives a runnable nucleus and proves the build + export pattern for that single feature.
  - However, the package is far from the full feature set described in the @voder/ui-tools specification. Major capabilities (Vite library factory, jsdom testing utilities, linting configurations, template files, mandatory scripts, test suites, and documentation) are still missing. The mandatory testing and packaging guarantees (dual exports, package-installation integration tests, comprehensive coverage) are not satisfied.
  - Functionality is therefore limited to a useful but very small subset of the target package; substantial implementation work and tests are required to reach the full specification.

Overall completion estimate: 30% (±15%).

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (75% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Overall the codebase is small, focused, and follows the project's ESM/TypeScript conventions (NodeNext module resolution, explicit .js extension in ESM import paths, strict TypeScript settings). The public API surface is intentionally minimal (src/index.ts re-exports), which reduces surface area for bugs.
- Strengths
  - Clear, simple public export barrel (no internal leaks).
  - TypeScript strict mode enabled and declarations produced (declaration: true).
  - Tests exist for the most important package-level concerns: package structure and a smoke test verifying the compiled entry export.
  - Vite config is defensive (dynamic optional import wrapped in try/catch) which avoids startup failures when optional plugins are missing.
  - Build/test patterns match the repo guidance (dist outputs, tests that validate exports point into dist/).
- Issues, risks, and potential bugs
  - Missing/unclear source presence for some exported functionality: the project references createPostCSSConfig (exported from './build/postcss.js') — the project documentation and dist outputs indicate an implementation exists, but the repository snapshot only shows src/index.ts (the actual src/build/postcss.ts file is not visible in the provided file list). If the source file is absent, tsc/type-check or rebuilding from source will fail. This is the single largest correctness risk.
  - Tests import compiled artifacts from dist/ (tests/smoke.test.ts imports ../dist/src/index.js). While this is intentional for package export validation, it couples test success to pre-existing compiled outputs being present in the workspace. That pattern is correct for the project's package-structure requirements but can mask issues in source that only surface when a fresh build occurs.
  - tsconfig.json includes prettier.config.ts in "include" but that file is not present in the repo listing; including non-existent files is harmless but indicates configuration drift.
  - vite.config.ts swallows plugin initialization errors silently. That avoids crashes but may make debugging plugin issues harder — errors are swallowed instead of being logged to stderr in a way that makes corrective action obvious.
  - There is no ESLint/prettier config or lint scripts present in package.json yet; coding-style enforcement is not visible in the snapshot. That reduces automated style consistency.
  - Minimal inline documentation and JSDoc on exported APIs — the code is small so this is acceptable, but it reduces discoverability for future maintainers.
  - Some exported/testing utilities described in the design doc (testing helpers, accessibility helpers, vite library factory, lint configs) are not present in src/ yet. This is not a bug per se, but the implementation is incomplete relative to the spec.
- Safety and correctness observations
  - The compiled dist/ test artifacts and smoke/package-structure tests show a previously successful verification run — that is a positive signal that a known-good build existed. However, recent history records TS5055 overwrite errors when tsc tried to write into tracked dist/ files; that is an operational problem (tracked build outputs) that can cause build failures. It appears a fix (exclude dist in tsconfig and removing tracked dist files) was applied, but care must be taken to ensure no residual tracked outputs remain.
  - The code uses ESM patterns consistently (explicit .js imports), which is correct for ESM distribution, but care must be taken that TypeScript sources and build outputs remain aligned.
- Recommendations to raise this assessment toward 90%:
  1. Verify presence of src/build/postcss.ts (and other planned source modules). If missing, restore/implement them so builds and type-checks are deterministic from source.
  2. Ensure dist/ outputs are untracked (git rm --cached -r dist/), tsconfig excludes dist, and tsc runs cleanly from source.
  3. Add ESLint/prettier configs and lint scripts to enforce style rules.
  4. Avoid silently swallowing errors in vite.config.ts — log initialization errors to stderr to aid debugging while keeping startup resilient.
  5. Add focused unit tests for createPostCSSConfig (and other core factory functions) that run against source-level behavior as well as integration tests against the compiled package for export validation.
  6. Add minimal JSDoc to exported APIs to improve clarity.
- Conclusion: The code is mostly well structured and follows project conventions; the principal issues are (a) a possible missing source file for the PostCSS implementation and (b) operational build hygiene (tracked dist files / tsc overwrite). Fixing those and adding linting/tests will address the main correctness and maintainability risks.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (20% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- There are two formal Vitest test files (package-structure and smoke) present and previously executed: both tests passed in the last *complete* verification run (2 tests total). The compiled/dist test artifacts (dist/tests/*.js) mirror those tests and the smoke test imports the compiled entry to validate the published export path.
- However, the test surface is extremely limited:
  - Tests only verify that package.json exports point to existing dist files and that the compiled entry exports createPostCSSConfig. They do not exercise the implementation of createPostCSSConfig itself, nor any other APIs described in the implementation guide (Vite factory, jsdom testing utilities, accessibility helpers, lint configs, template generation, etc.).
  - No unit tests exist for core logic (e.g., PostCSS config generation), no jsdom-based tests for DOM helpers, and no integration/package-installation tests that simulate consumer installs.
- Coverage: there is no coverage report checked into the repo and no evidence tests achieve the repository requirement (≥90%). Given only two small tests exist, measured coverage will be very low and far short of the stated target.
- Current runability: the most recent verification run failed during TypeScript build (TS5055 overwrite errors), so a fresh run of the full test pipeline is currently blocked until the build issue is resolved. When the build issue is fixed, the existing tests should run and likely pass (as before), but they will still be insufficient for coverage/requirements.
- Summary judgment:
  - Tests: present but sparse and narrowly scoped — adequate for a minimal smoke/package-structure sanity check but not for validating functionality or ensuring API correctness.
  - Passing state: historically green for the two tests, but the latest CI-like pipeline is failing at build time (so tests haven't just been re-run successfully).
  - Coverage: inadequate; does not meet the project's stated coverage requirements.

Recommendations (concise, focused on testing):
- Add unit tests for createPostCSSConfig that assert autoprefixer plugin presence and correct default browsers list.
- Add tests for any exported factories/utilities as they are implemented (vite factory, vitest jsdom factory, DOM helpers, accessibility helpers).
- Add integration/package-installation tests (pack + local install) and export-equivalence tests when dual-exports are implemented.
- Fix the TypeScript build overwrite (exclude dist or untrack dist) so the full test pipeline can be run reliably and coverage can be measured.
- Run test:coverage/test:ci after expanding tests to obtain a real coverage number and iterate until coverage meets policy.

Overall: testing is at an early stage — functional but minimal (estimated 20% complete ±10%).

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (70% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Partially: earlier verification runs completed (tsc type-check and a previous tsc build passed, and Vitest smoke/package-structure tests passed), but the most recent full verification failed during the build step with TypeScript TS5055 "overwrite" errors (tsc attempted to write into files under dist/ that are being treated as inputs). As a result the full pipeline (type-check → build → test) is not currently passing end-to-end. The build/test scripts themselves are implemented and have worked, but repository state (tracked/placed dist artifacts or tsconfig/build overlap) is preventing a successful, repeatable run now.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (60% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains a strong set of internal documentation for design and decisions: MADR-style ADRs are present under docs/decisions (both local and inherited), and those ADRs are thorough and well‑formatted. There are focused “library usage” pages (docs/libraries/usage/*) and a comprehensive implementation guide in prompts/development-ui-tools.md that documents API intent, examples, tests, and rationale — excellent for maintainers and LLM-driven development.
- What’s good (strengths)
  - Clear, well-written ADRs capturing architecture and dependency decisions.
  - Topic-specific docs (PostCSS, dev-config usage) with usage examples.
  - Detailed internal implementation guide (prompts/development-ui-tools.md) that includes API examples, test guidance, and templates.
  - Tests and examples in the repo that serve as implicit documentation of expected behavior.
- Missing / weak areas (gaps)
  - No public README.md at the package root. A consumer-facing README is required (installation, quick start, API summary, security posture, license notice). Current docs are internal and reference internal paths; README must be self-contained and only reference published artifacts.
  - No CHANGELOG.md. A changelog following the project template is expected for releases and auditability.
  - No formal API reference or generated docs for exported functions/types (e.g., createPostCSSConfig, types). Consumers need a concise API surface summary in README or a docs/api.md.
  - No .markdownlint.json (or script to generate it) committed — required by the universal guide and ADRs that mandate markdown linting setup and lint:md scripts.
  - Missing contributor/dev setup doc (short README section or CONTRIBUTING.md) that explains how to run verify, tests, build, and the Node engine requirements referenced in docs.
  - No published examples catalogue (small demo snippets are scattered in prompts/docs but not consolidated into a consumer-facing how‑to).
  - Some internal docs (prompts/*) are very large and developer/LLM-focused — useful internally but not suitable as the package’s external docs.
- Recommended next steps to reach “complete” state
  1. Add a package README.md (public-facing) using the provided README template: Purpose, install, quick start, API surface (summary of exports), security posture, license (UNLICENSED), and basic troubleshooting. Ensure it contains only published/public references (no internal relative links).
  2. Add CHANGELOG.md using the provided template.
  3. Add a short API reference (docs/api.md or README section) that lists exported factories, options, and return shapes (or links to small example snippets).
  4. Commit a .markdownlint.json (or generate script) and add lint:md / lint:md:fix scripts in package.json per the mandatory policy.
  5. Add a short CONTRIBUTING.md or “Developer setup” section in README explaining verify/script usage, Node engine requirement, and how to run tests locally.
  6. Consolidate and surface a small “Examples” doc with the most important usage snippets (vite.config, vitest setup, renderComponent example) taken from prompts — trimmed for consumers.
  7. Ensure docs do not reference internal prompt files and comply with "README ISOLATION" rules.
- Overall assessment
  - The internal engineering documentation (decisions, design guides) is excellent and largely complete for maintainers and LLM agents. However, consumer‑facing and packaging documentation is incomplete: missing README, CHANGELOG, and a concise API reference plus markdown-lint setup. Addressing those gaps should move the repo into the 85–95% documentation-complete range.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (90% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall: The project’s dependencies appear current and well-aligned for a modern TypeScript + Vitest UI tooling package. An earlier audit run reported zero vulnerabilities (npm audit output referenced in the history), and the key toolchain pieces (TypeScript, Vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, jsdom) are pinned to recent major/minor releases in devDependencies.
- Freshness:
  - TypeScript is pinned at ^5.9.2 — very recent and appropriate for ES2022/NodeNext usage.
  - Vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 are at ^3.2.4 and aligned to one another (good — avoids provider peer-compat issues).
  - jsdom is at ^26.x and @testing-library packages are recent; PostCSS (8.x) and Autoprefixer (10.x) are typical and stable for current UI pipelines.
  - markdownlint-cli2 and other tooling are present at plausible recent versions.
- Security: The repository’s dependency audit (reported in the history) shows zero reported vulnerabilities. That indicates no immediate high/critical issues were found by npm audit at last check.
- Compatibility / Risk notes:
  - Peer vs dev mismatch: package.json lists jest-axe as a peerDependency at ^9.0.0 while devDependencies include jest-axe ^10.0.0. This is a metadata mismatch that can cause confusing peer warnings for consumers — it should be aligned (either waive the peer or update the peer range to match the dev version).
  - There are no runtime "dependencies" (only peerDependencies and devDependencies). Ensure consumers will have required peer tools documented and consistent (the ADRs discuss this).
  - The package does not declare an engines/node requirement in package.json even though docs expect Node ≥22.6.0; this is not a dependency vulnerability but a compatibility signal consumers may need.
- Recommendations (small, non-invasive):
  - Align peerDependencies.jest-axe with the devDependency (update peer to ^10.0.0) to remove consumer warnings (the project’s plan already contemplates this).
  - Periodically re-run npm audit and keep Vitest/coverage provider aligned on updates.
  - Optionally add an "engines" field documenting Node ≥22.6.0 to reduce surprises when consumers import TypeScript-based configs.
- Conclusion: No significant security problems reported and core tool versions are modern and compatible. The only actionable compatibility issue I see is the jest-axe peer/dev mismatch and general peerDependency hygiene for consumer tooling.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary
  - There are no obvious direct code-level vulnerabilities (no use of eval, no uncontrolled file writes into the repo, no network calls in runtime code, no credential secrets checked into source). The source is largely configuration factories, test helpers and small utilities; they operate locally and do not perform I/O outside tests and normal Node APIs.
  - The primary security exposure is supply‑chain / build-time: many development tools and optional plugins are loaded dynamically or executed in build/test scripts. That creates the usual risk that a compromised dependency or malicious package in node_modules (or a compromised npm registry mirror) could execute at build/test/prepare time.
  - No runtime web-facing code is present, so there are no immediate XSS/SQL/SSRF/CSRF type issues in package code itself.

- Items found and risk level
  1. Supply‑chain / build-time execution (Medium)
     - Dynamic import in vite.config.ts: the code dynamically imports an optional plugin ('vite-plugin-inline-source') and executes it if present. That means arbitrary module code could run during local builds if an attacker manages to replace or compromise that package.
     - package.json scripts (prepare, build, test, etc.) will execute JS/shell commands during local development and CI. The `prepare` script runs node ../../setup-package-docs.js — arbitrary JS run automatically during install can be a vector if contributors install packages from an untrusted source or a compromised mirror.
     - Many devDependencies and peerDependencies (vitest, postcss, autoprefixer, markdownlint-cli2, jsdom, etc.) expand the attack surface. Although they are devDependencies, they still run on developer machines and CI (where code execution occurs).
     - Recommendation: ensure lockfile integrity, run supply-chain audits, pin or exact-version critical tools (or use deterministic lockfiles), and restrict/monitor prepare scripts. (An ADR about supply‑chain auditing exists in docs — follow it.)

  2. Dependency versioning / update policy (Low → Medium)
     - package.json uses caret ranges for many deps (devDependencies and peerDependencies). This allows installs to pull newer semver-compatible versions that may introduce breaking changes or, in rare cases, malicious code if a package is compromised.
     - Recommendation: use lockfile (package-lock.json/pnpm-lock) in CI, consider pinning critical tooling versions, enable CI dependency scanning, and add automated tests that detect breaking toolchain behavior.

  3. Execution of shell commands in documentation/tests examples (Low)
     - Docs and proposed tests (in guidance) show usage of execSync and child_process for integration tests. While not present in source code here, running these tests in CI or locally will execute commands. Tests that run npm pack, npm install or spawn node in temp dirs should be run in isolated environments (CI runners) and not on untrusted machines.
     - Recommendation: run such integration tests in CI sandboxes and ensure they run with least privilege.

  4. No sensitive data leakage observed (Low)
     - No secrets, credentials, or .env contents checked into repo. .gitignore includes .env and other outputs.
     - Recommendation: continue enforcing secret scanning and keep .gitignore up to date.

  5. Test environment / jsdom usage (Low)
     - Tests rely on jsdom and jest-axe. These packages parse HTML and may execute some DOM logic in Node. This is normal for unit tests but should not be run on untrusted inputs. No direct injection/vulnerable patterns observed in helpers (they avoid innerHTML usage).
     - Recommendation: avoid using innerHTML with untrusted test fixtures; sanitize inputs if tests load external HTML.

  6. File system protections (Low)
     - Code examples and utilities use existsSync/readFileSync in tests; no unguarded writes into the repository are present in source files. The repo policy forbids creating output files in repo; temporary files are to be used in OS temp dirs. Current code complies with that pattern.
     - Recommendation: continue to follow the console-first and temp-directory patterns.

- Practical mitigations (recommended, prioritized)
  1. Enforce lockfile use in CI and run regular automated supply‑chain audits (npm audit, SCA tools). (High priority)
  2. Pin or align exact versions for critical test/build tooling (vitest + coverage provider, vite-plugin families) or at least enforce lockfile immutability in CI. (High)
  3. Avoid or restrict running `prepare` scripts from untrusted contexts; review any code referenced by package.json `prepare` and `voder` scripts. Consider gating `prepare` execution in contributor onboarding or documenting its behavior. (High)
  4. Add dependency integrity checks (npm ci with lockfile verification, or use checksum/integrity verification in CI). (Medium)
  5. Limit dynamic imports of optional plugins where possible, or validate plugin module identity (e.g., require trusted install sources). If dynamic import is necessary, log a clear warning and fail-safe to avoid silent execution of unknown code. (Medium)
  6. Continue to avoid committing build artifacts and keep .gitignore and .voderignore accurate. (Low)
  7. Run continuous dependency scanning (Snyk/Dependabot) and ensure ADRs for dependency additions are produced (this repo already records ADRs). (Low→Medium)

- Verdict
  - No immediate exploitable code-level vulnerabilities were found in the repository code itself. The dominant security concern is supply-chain and build-time code execution via many dev dependencies, dynamic plugin loading, and lifecycle scripts. These are common and manageable risks if mitigations above are applied and CI enforces lockfile and audit discipline.

Notes on assessment confidence: 80% ±10% complete — assessment focuses on code present in repository and the declared scripts/dependencies. I have not executed the code or performed an automated dependency scan; those steps would increase coverage and may surface additional issues (e.g., vulnerable transitive deps).

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (15% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, fully-synchronized state: there are unstaged/modified files in the working tree and at least one local commit that has not been pushed to origin. Because uncommitted changes exist the project cannot be considered well-managed under version control — this alone caps completeness very low. The additional presence of an unpushed commit and imperfect file-tracking further reduce confidence.
- Specific findings:
  - Uncommitted (modified, unstaged) files: .voder/history.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md — these must be staged/committed or intentionally stashed/ignored before the repo is clean.
  - Unpushed commit: branch main is ahead of origin/main by 1 commit (local commit(s) not yet synchronized with remote).
  - File tracking: summary shows "Project files tracked: 22/28" (some project files are not tracked), and total tracked files vs expected indicates the workspace is not fully tracked. .gitignore correctly covers build artifacts (dist/, coverage/, etc.), which is good, but the tracked vs expected ratio suggests important files remain untracked.
  - Working tree status: not clean — both uncommitted changes and unpushed commits present, so the repository is not in a publishable state.
  
Overall, version-control management requires: commit or stash the modified files, push outstanding commits to origin, and review any untracked project files to decide whether they should be added or intentionally ignored. Until those steps are done the repository is far from fully compliant with the "clean, synchronized" criteria.
