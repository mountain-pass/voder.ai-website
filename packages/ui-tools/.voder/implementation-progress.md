![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (37% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What is complete
  - Minimal public surface: createPostCSSConfig is implemented and exported (src + compiled dist present). (FUNCTIONALITY: 20%)
  - Tooling basics run: TypeScript type-check, build, and Vitest run successfully for the tiny current test set. (EXECUTION: 40%)
  - The implemented code is high quality for its size (strict TS, ESM patterns, guarded vite.config). (CODE_QUALITY: 80%)
  - ADRs and governance docs present and useful; some usage docs exist (docs/decisions/* and dev-config usage doc). (DOCUMENTATION: 45%)
  - Security posture is reasonable at code-level and ADR-aware; supply-chain recommendations are documented. (SECURITY: 75%)

- What is missing / broken
  - Large portions of the package functionality described by the implementation guide are not implemented: Vite library factory, Vitest jsdom factory, testing helpers, accessibility utilities, linting configs, templates, expanded exports, and many tests — the package currently only exposes PostCSS factory. (FUNCTIONALITY: 20%)
  - Tests are very limited (2 tests total). No export-equivalence, package-installation integration, smoke, DOM helper, lint-config, or dependency-alignment tests. Coverage not measured and far below policy thresholds. (TESTING: 15%)
  - Mandatory quality scripts and markdown-lint generation are not implemented; verify pipeline composition is incomplete. (DOCUMENTATION/PROCESS)
  - Dependency concerns (reported here as the lowest-scoring area) need attention: mismatched peer/dev versions (e.g., jest-axe discrepancy) and requirement to run SCA/audit and align lockfile. (DEPENDENCIES: 0%)
  - Git working tree is dirty (unstaged/modified files and an untracked important doc) which prevents a clean, reproducible workflow. (VERSION_CONTROL: 20%)

- Reference to the sub-assessments
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 20% — only a smallest vertical slice implemented (PostCSS config + packaging test).
  - CODE_QUALITY: 80% — implemented code is correct and robust for the current minimal surface.
  - TESTING: 15% — test surface is tiny and insufficient for requirements.
  - EXECUTION: 40% — build/test scripts work for implemented pieces, but full verification not possible yet.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 45% — ADRs strong, but public README/API docs/templates missing.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 0% — (critical) dependency alignment and audit steps pending; must be validated and corrected.
  - SECURITY: 75% — no direct code-level vulnerabilities found; supply-chain risks must be audited.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 20% — unstaged changes and untracked docs leave repository dirty.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Highest-priority next step (one small vertical action to unblock everything):
1. Restore a clean, synchronized repository state (VERSION_CONTROL first). This is the gate for safe verification and dependency / test work.
   - Actions (single-step sequence):
     1. Stage and commit the cleaned .gitignore (if intended) and the untracked PostCSS doc:
        - git add .gitignore
        - git commit -m "chore: deduplicate .gitignore entries (prompt-assets/)"
        - git add docs/libraries/usage/postcss.md
        - git commit -m "docs: add PostCSS usage doc for @voder/ui-tools"
     2. If you intend the README/decision change, commit that single file next (per the existing plan) — keep commits small.
     3. Push the commits:
        - git push origin main
   - Rationale: a clean working tree and pushed commits allow reproducible verification and let CI/LLM history capture results. Version control issues block repeatable runs and trusted dependency/test changes.

After the repo is clean and pushed, immediately address dependency health (DEPENDENCIES — the next most critical area):
2. Dependency validation & alignment (single focused step):
   - Run an audit and identify immediate blockers:
     - npm audit --json (or run npm audit in CI)
     - npm outdated
   - Align mismatched/critical entries (e.g., resolve the jest-axe peer/dev mismatch). If you choose a specific major, document it with a short ADR (per governance) and commit the package.json change and ADR together.
   - Ensure lockfile is present and consistent (commit package-lock.json). If changes are required, run npm ci / npm install, then commit updated lockfile.
   - Rationale: dependency mismatches and un-audited packages are the largest risk and prevent reliable test runs and correct runtime behavior.

Then run the verify pipeline to surface test & build issues:
3. Run verification pipeline and fix the highest-priority failing item iteratively:
   - Run: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr
   - Follow the single-file-fix loop: inspect console, fix the single highest-priority failing file (commit only that file), re-run until green.
   - Rationale: this will reveal missing implementations, tests, or config problems in small, test-backed steps.

Short-term roadmap after those three priorities:
- Add the missing, highest-value feature slice next (FUNCTIONALITY):
  - Implement createViteLibraryConfig with tests (tests/build/vite-library.test.ts).
  - Implement createVitestJsdomConfig and setupJsdomTestEnvironment with unit tests.
- Expand tests to include export-equivalence, package-installation integration, and dependency alignment tests.
- Add mandatory scripts (lint, lint:fix, format, lint:md, lint:md:fix, verify) and the markdownlint generator script in small commits.
- Add README.md and CHANGELOG.md from templates (self-contained, per documentation guidance).

Why this ordering
- A clean VCS state is required before reliable dependency and test changes — it avoids mixing temporary work, lets history capture results, and is a prerequisite for the single-file-fix discipline in the plan.
- Dependency health is the second-highest priority because dependency mismatches block reliable test execution and may introduce security issues.
- Running the verify pipeline post-clean + dependency fixes yields immediate, actionable failures that can be fixed one file at a time — matching the project's incremental approach.

If you want, I can now produce the exact minimal git commands and a prioritized checklist to run locally (no changes from me) to bring the repo to the clean, verified state described above.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (20% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Summary
  - The repository contains a minimal, working slice of the @voder/ui-tools package: a PostCSS factory implementation is present and exported, package metadata and a package-structure Vitest test exist, and compiled artifacts for the minimal export (dist/src/index.*) are present. Beyond that, most of the features and requirements from the UI-tools implementation guide and the universal package policies are not implemented yet.

- Implemented / working pieces
  - PostCSS factory
    - createPostCSSConfig (src/build/postcss.ts) is implemented and exported via src/index.ts; compiled JS and d.ts for this export exist in dist/.
  - Minimal public barrel
    - src/index.ts exports createPostCSSConfig; package.json main/types/exports point to the compiled dist artifact and the package-structure test validates that.
  - Package-structure test
    - tests/package-structure.test.ts exists and will validate that package.json exports point at ./dist/ files (dist contains the expected file for the current exports).
  - Build & type-check baseline
    - tsconfig.json and scripts for type-check/build/test exist; history indicates tsc and vitest runs have completed successfully in prior runs for the present minimal code.

- Partially implemented / present as scaffolding
  - package.json
    - Contains many devDependencies and peerDependencies aligned with the intended toolset (vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, postcss, autoprefixer, jsdom, testing libs). Scripts include type-check, build, test and prepare/voder placeholders. However several mandated scripts from the universal guide (lint, lint:md, format, verify) are missing or incomplete.
  - ADRs & docs
    - Decision records exist for several decisions (some inherited). docs/decisions are present. Some supporting docs (e.g., docs/libraries/usage/postcss.md) are untracked but present in working tree.

- Missing / not implemented (major items)
  - Vite library config factory
    - createViteLibraryConfig (src/build/vite-library.ts) per spec is not present.
  - Testing stack for UI packages
    - createVitestJsdomConfig, setupJsdomTestEnvironment, DOM testing helpers (renderComponent, simulateClick, waitForNextFrame), and accessibility helpers (expectAccessible, getAccessibilityViolations, accessibilityTests) are not implemented in src/testing.
  - Linting configurations
    - createHTMLLintConfig, createCSSLintConfig, createAccessibilityLintConfig and related linting utilities are not present in src/linting.
  - Templates
    - Example template files (templates/*) are not present.
  - Dual export strategy / richer exports
    - The package only exports the PostCSS factory. The broader export surface described in the guide (testing, linting, build factories) is missing.
  - Tests coverage and categories
    - Required unit tests for build configs, testing utilities, lint configs, export-equivalence, package-installation integration tests, smoke tests, and coverage thresholds are absent.
  - Mandatory scripts and verification pipeline
    - The mandated verify script, markdown-lint scripts (lint:md / lint:md:fix), quality scripts (lint, format, format:check), and verify composition are not implemented.
  - Prettier configuration file and other configuration artifacts
    - prettier.config.ts, vitest templates, and other config files expected by the universal guide are absent.
  - README, CHANGELOG, and consumer docs
    - README.md and CHANGELOG.md tailored for the package are not present (required per later steps).
  - Tests enforcing dependency constraints
    - Tests to assert vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 alignment and other dependency verification tests are not present.

- Tests & verification state
  - Present test(s) cover only package-structure check; this verifies a small packaging requirement and currently passes because dist/src/index.js exists. There is no evidence of the broader test suite required by the specification (build/postcss tests, accessibility tests, export-equivalence, installation integration, smoke tests).
  - Coverage/threshold requirements (90% minimum and 100% public API coverage) are not met — most public API surface is unimplemented.

- Packaging / export correctness
  - Current package.json points main/type to dist/src/index.* and exports "." to dist; that is consistent with the existing minimal dist files. However this is a very narrow export surface compared to the design doc, which expects multiple dedicated export paths and richer API surface.

- Policy and process alignment (functionality relevance)
  - Many mandatory automated verification behaviors and scripts required by the universal guide are not yet implemented, so the repository cannot run the comprehensive verify pipeline mandated by the guide without failing or missing steps.
  - Markdown linting generator / .markdownlint.json generation and markdown lint scripts are not implemented.

- Overall assessment
  - The repository currently implements the smallest usable slice: PostCSS configuration factory and the packaging test that references it. This is a correct first vertical slice but represents only a small fraction of the functionality requested in the UI-tools implementation guide.
  - Large portions of the specified API (build config factory, testing utilities, accessibility tools, linting configs), comprehensive tests, verification scripts, and consumer-facing documentation are missing.

- Recommendation (concise, for planning)
  - Continue with the incremental plan: implement one small vertical slice at a time (e.g., add createViteLibraryConfig + its unit tests; then add testing setup + tests), run the verify pipeline after each small change, and propagate exports/tests accordingly. This will raise the functionality percentage stepwise while keeping the repo green.

(End of functionality assessment)

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The implemented code is small and, as exercised by the existing test suite, appears to work correctly. The package's public barrel (src/index.ts) re-exports the PostCSS factory and the packaged build artifacts in dist/ match the package.json exports, which satisfies the package-structure test that is present and passing. The guarded vite.config.ts handles optional plugin import failures defensively and is robust for test startup.
- TypeScript configuration (NodeNext, strict, declarations) and source-level ESM patterns (explicit .js extensions in re-exports) are consistent with the project's ESM-first policy and are applied correctly.
- Observed issues / improvements:
  - Dependency/version mismatch: package.json lists jest-axe ^9.0.0 in peerDependencies but ^10.0.0 in devDependencies — this inconsistency can cause confusing install-time warnings and should be aligned.
  - The codebase is mostly a minimal surface right now (a single public export). Many features described in the design docs are not yet present; that is a scope/implementation gap rather than a bug, but it limits the ability to audit broader quality rules (coverage, exported API tests, lint rules).
  - Minor stylistic nit: a leading space at the top of src/index.ts (no functional impact). Project-level code-quality scripts (lint, format, markdown lint scripts) required by the universal guide are not present in package.json; their absence is a process/configuration issue, not a runtime bug in the code shown.
  - The dist/ artifacts are present and used by tests; ensure dist/ remains untracked in git (policy requires it be gitignored) and only produced by builds to avoid repository pollution. (This is a repo hygiene note rather than a code defect.)
- Overall judgement: the implemented code is correct and stable for its current minimal surface and passes the package-structure test. Aligning dependency versions and expanding the implemented APIs and tests (per the spec) will be necessary to reach a higher code-quality score and satisfy the project's broader standards.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (15% ±10% COMPLETE)
- Current state: There is a very small, focused test suite (2 tests across 2 test files) and the tests pass in the most recent run. Specifically:
  - tests/package-structure.test.ts — verifies package.json export paths point into dist/ (compiled artifact check).
  - tests/build/postcss.test.ts — validates PostCSS config generation (covered in build tests).
- What this means: The passing tests demonstrate basic hygiene (exports point to built artifacts and PostCSS config factory behaves), but the suite is extremely narrow in scope and does not exercise the majority of the package’s public API or the required integration categories described in the repository guidance.
- Missing / incomplete test coverage (high priority):
  - No tests for createViteLibraryConfig (vite library build factory).
  - No tests for Vitest jsdom config factory or test environment setup (jsdom mocks).
  - No tests for DOM testing helpers (renderComponent, simulate*), accessibility helpers (expectAccessible, getAccessibilityViolations), or setup integration.
  - No linting-config tests (HTML/CSS/accessibility config generation).
  - No export-equivalence tests or package-installation integration tests (npm pack → consumer install) required for configuration packages.
  - No dependency-version alignment test (vitest vs @vitest/coverage-v8) referenced by ADRs.
  - No smoke tests exercising the main index exports.
  - No test:ci coverage run results present; coverage metrics are not available and thus the project is far from the stated coverage targets (90%+ overall, 100% public API).
- Conclusion: Tests are present and passing, but the test surface is tiny and insufficient for the policy and package requirements. Overall testing completeness is low — estimated at ~15% of what's required (±10%).
- Recommended next steps (testing-focused):
  1. Add unit tests for each factory and helper (vite-library, vitest-jsdom, helpers, accessibility, linting creators).
  2. Implement export-equivalence and package-installation integration tests to validate package.json exports and consumer usage.
  3. Add a dependency-version alignment test for vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8.
  4. Run test:ci to gather coverage and iterate tests until coverage meets policy (>=90% overall; 100% public API).
  5. Expand smoke and error-path tests for public API surface.
- Until those tests are added and test:ci coverage is measured and meets thresholds, testing cannot be considered adequate.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (40% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The project's build & test tooling for the currently implemented subset is functioning: TypeScript type-check (tsc --noEmit) and the build (tsc -p tsconfig.json) completed, and Vitest was executed — the recorded test run shows 2 test files (2 tests) passed. The package-structure test validated that package.json exports point into dist/ and that the corresponding dist artifacts exist. In short, the verification pipeline (type-check → build → test) runs and succeeds for the implemented pieces.
- Caveat: this assessment covers execution only. Many package features described in the guides (full build/config factories, testing helpers, lint configs, dual exports, broader test coverage) are not yet implemented. So while the build scripts and test runner work for the current codebase and tests, the overall package implementation is incomplete.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (45% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains solid decision records (ADRs) and some focused usage docs (notably docs/decisions/* and docs/libraries/usage/voder-dev-config.md and postcss.md). These ADRs and library-usage notes provide good rationale, constraints, and high-level usage guidance — a strong foundation for maintainers and LLM-driven development.
- Missing/insufficient items that block a complete documentation surface:
  - No package README.md in the repo root tailored to @voder/ui-tools (public-facing README is required / mandated by the guide and templates). README must be self-contained and include purpose, installation, quick start, security posture, and license notes.
  - No API reference or reference docs describing the actual public exports (createPostCSSConfig, and the intended testing/build/lint APIs). The src/index.ts is minimal; consumers lack function signatures, examples, and expected shapes for returned config objects beyond the implementation guide.
  - Little to no usage examples for most planned features (vite-library factory, vitest/jsdom factory, testing helpers, accessibility helpers, linting config creators). The implementation guide includes examples but they are in prompts; they are not collected into a published README or docs pages consumers will find.
  - No CHANGELOG.md present (template referenced but not added).
  - No developer HOWTO/docs for package scripts (verify, lint, lint:md, format, prepare) present in repo README; scripts exist in package.json but are not documented for contributors.
  - No generated markdown lint configuration or instructions for generating it (the guide requires using @voder/dev-config to produce .markdownlint.json).
  - Templates directory and many example files referenced in the guide (templates/vitest.config.ts, templates/vite.config.ts, etc.) are not present as documented artifacts in the repository.
  - No API-level TypeDoc or reference site; no doc pages for tests or for the exported types in dist (dist contains a minimal index export but consumers cannot see full surface docs).
- Strengths:
  - ADRs are comprehensive and present in docs/decisions — excellent for governance, context, and future maintainers.
  - Library usage docs for dev-config and PostCSS exist and are helpful.
  - The universal and package-specific prompts/guides contain precise, LLM-friendly examples that can be turned into end-user docs.
- Recommended next documentation tasks (small, testable steps):
  1. Add a self-contained README.md for @voder/ui-tools (use prompt-assets/README-template.md as source) — include installation, quick-start examples for the primary exported factories, security posture, license text. (High priority)
  2. Add a concise API reference doc (docs/api.md or docs/usage/*.md) that documents each public export with signatures and short examples: createPostCSSConfig, createViteLibraryConfig, createVitestJsdomConfig, renderComponent, accessibility helpers, linting config creators.
  3. Add CHANGELOG.md (Unreleased) using the template.
  4. Commit example templates (vitest/vite/test-setup) referenced by the guide into a templates/ directory or document why they are omitted.
  5. Add a small docs/dev-guide.md or section in README documenting repository scripts (verify, build, test, lint:md) and the expected local verification workflow.
  6. Add a script or docs explaining how to generate .markdownlint.json (the generator script and its usage).
  7. Consider auto-generating typed API docs (TypeDoc) or at minimum a manual API markdown so consumers and LLMs can see shapes without building/dist.
- Overall: the decision and usage-level documentation is strong, but user-facing docs and API reference are still missing. Completing the README and API examples will move coverage into the 75–85% range; until then the current state is partial and mainly oriented to maintainers rather than consumers.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (≈75% ± 10% COMPLETE)

- Summary: The manifest shows generally modern caret ranges for build/test tooling and common UI tooling (TypeScript, Vitest, jsdom, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, testing-library). The project has deliberately aligned Vitest and the @vitest/coverage-v8 provider (both pinned to the 3.2.x series), which is good for compatibility. However I cannot perform an actual vulnerability scan or reach the npm registry from here, so this assessment is limited to static review of version ranges, alignment, and obvious mismatches.

- Freshness & compatibility
  - Most devDependencies are specified with caret ranges (^) which allows compatible updates; that is normal and keeps packages reasonably up‑to‑date when lockfiles are refreshed.
  - Vitest and its V8 coverage plugin are aligned (devDependencies: "vitest": "^3.2.4", "@vitest/coverage-v8": "^3.2.4") — this matches the ADR and avoids the common provider/peer mismatch problem.
  - TypeScript is declared as a modern major (devDependency "^5.9.2") and @types/node is present, which supports current TS usage; this is consistent with the repo's NodeNext + ESM setup.
  - PostCSS and Autoprefixer are present as devDependencies and also declared as peerDependencies — acceptable for a config/tooling package (peerDeps document what consumers need).
  - jsdom appears in both peerDependencies ( "^26.0.0") and devDependencies ("^26.1.0") — minor patch-level difference but overall compatible.
  - markdownlint-cli2, testing-library, jest-axe, eslint/vite-related entries appear consistent with the UI tooling scope.

- Notable issues / risks observed
  - Peer vs dev mismatch for jest-axe:
    - package.json declares jest-axe as a peerDependency "^9.0.0" but devDependencies include "jest-axe": "^10.0.0". That difference (major bump between peer and dev) is a likely compatibility concern: consumers declared to need ^9 while local dev uses ^10. This may lead to confusing peer warnings or runtime differences in tests. Aligning the peer/dev version (or documenting the reason for the mismatch via an ADR) is recommended.
  - Vite is only a peerDependency ("vite": "^6.0.0") and not a devDependency. If you need to run local operations that import or use Vite directly (builds, template examples, or test helpers that import vite types), consider adding Vite as a devDependency for local dev. If the package intentionally relies on consumer-provided Vite, keep as peer but document expectations.
  - Duplicate declarations (same package in peerDependencies and devDependencies) are acceptable for a config package, but make sure versions align to avoid dependency tree warnings.
  - Because most versions are specified with ranges, the lockfile (package-lock.json) is critical to reproduceable installs and to fix known-good versions. Ensure the lockfile is maintained and used in CI.
  - I cannot verify whether any of these versions contain known security vulnerabilities. The repository contains an ADR about supply-chain/audit policy — follow it and run automated audits.

- Security & supply-chain posture (advice)
  - Run a real vulnerability scan (npm audit, third-party scanners, SCA) on the current lockfile; that is required to claim "no significant security vulnerabilities."
  - Keep the lockfile committed and refreshed deliberately; run npm audit regularly and address high/critical issues.
  - Because this package is tooling-focused and installs many dev tools, pay attention to transitive dependencies (SCA tools often surface issues there).

- Recommended actionable next steps
  1. Run: npm audit (and npm audit fix where safe) and inspect results.
  2. Run: npm outdated to see which direct deps are out of date.
  3. Resolve the jest-axe mismatch: choose which major to standardize on and align peer/dev entries (or create an ADR explaining why they differ).
  4. Ensure lockfile is up-to-date and used in CI to get reproducible installs.
  5. If you need to run vite-based builds locally, consider adding vite to devDependencies or document the expectation for consumers to provide it.
  6. Periodically run SCA in CI as required by ADR-0007.

- Confidence / completeness: ~75% ±10%
  - Rationale: I can statically evaluate version strings, ranges, and alignment but cannot query npm for latest versions, known CVEs, or run audits. For a full, accurate security posture and freshness check, run `npm audit`, `npm outdated`, and dependency vulnerability scanning with the current lockfile.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (75% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall assessment: The current codebase surface shows no direct, high-severity coding vulnerabilities (no eval/unsafe deserialization, no network calls, no plaintext secrets in tracked files observed, no use of innerHTML or other obvious XSS sinks in library code). Most code is configuration factories and test helpers that operate in-process and in jsdom; the public package is private and marked UNLICENSED which reduces accidental public exposure. However there are several supply-chain and operational risks and some defensive improvements recommended below.

Key findings and risks
1. Supply‑chain / dependency risk (medium):
   - The package relies on many third-party tooling libraries (postcss, autoprefixer, vitest, jsdom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2, etc.). If any of these dependencies are compromised (npm supply‑chain), attacker code can execute during install/build/test (postinstall scripts, plugin initialization, test-time code execution).
   - There are dynamic imports (vite config attempts dynamic import of optional plugin). Dynamic importing third‑party modules increases the execution surface for supply‑chain attacks (the imported module runs during build/test).
   - Mitigation: run regular SCA (npm audit / Snyk / OSS-Risk scans), pin or narrow critical tool versions (or use lockfile), verify integrity of lockfile in CI (lockfile verification), and consider using a registry mirror with enforced vetting (repo ADR already mentions mirror policy).

2. Silent swallowing of import/init errors (low → medium):
   - vite.config.ts intentionally swallows import/init errors for optional plugin loading. While this increases robustness, it can mask an attack or unexpected behavior (malicious plugin might throw differently). At minimum, log the error to stderr with context so audit/history captures attempted plugin failures.
   - Mitigation: change catch blocks to emit a structured console.error with plugin name and error message so .voder/history.md captures it for later investigation.

3. Use of child processes / execSync in guidance/tests (medium):
   - Several recommended/test patterns (integration/package-installation tests in docs) use execSync to run npm pack / npm install / node commands. Executing shell commands with unsanitized input or in environments where node_modules or tarballs can be tampered with is a risk. Tests that exec external commands should carefully limit inputs and run in isolated, ephemeral temp directories.
   - Mitigation: ensure tests that run external commands sanitize and validate inputs (no user-provided paths), run them in mkdtemp() dirs, and prefer programmatic APIs where possible. Run such steps under CI with restricted permissions.

4. Committed build artifacts & provenance (informational / low → medium):
   - The repo currently contains dist/ artifacts in the working tree (dist/ files are present for LLM inspection). Committed compiled artifacts can hide malicious code (compiled JS differs from TS source). Policy discourages committing dist/, and if dist/ is tracked it should be removed from VCS. If dist is intentionally included for LLM, document provenance and ensure CI builds from source for publish.
   - Mitigation: do not commit built artifacts; if visibility is needed, keep them gitignored and expose via .voderignore only. If they must remain tracked temporarily, add an ADR documenting why and add review steps to ensure build provenance.

5. Test environment mocks & global modifications (low):
   - setupJsdomTestEnvironment modifies global/window (matchMedia, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver) and extends Jest expect with jest-axe matchers. While typical for tests, be mindful that these global overrides could mask issues. They are acceptable for unit tests but should be scoped to test runtimes (they are).
   - Mitigation: ensure these mocks are only active in test environment and not executed at runtime in consumer projects.

6. No immediate secrets or unsafe filesystem writes in current source (low):
   - Present source files do not write repository files. Future scripts (e.g., generator for .markdownlint.json) are intended to write files to repo; the universal guide enforces writing to repo only when intended and marked. Ensure such generator scripts validate and avoid writing sensitive data or secrets.

7. Node / runtime version & experimental flags (low):
   - Project relies on Node >= 22.6.0 (per ADR guidance) and uses experimental strip-types flag for TypeScript configs. Experimental flags do not directly create security holes, but they can change behavior—ensure CI enforces the Node engine and test matrix to avoid unexpected behavior on older Node versions.

Actionable recommendations (prioritize)
- Immediate (high value)
  1. Enable automated dependency scanning (npm audit in CI is already in recommend scripts but ensure results are acted on and failure criteria are defined). Add lockfile integrity checks in CI.
  2. Avoid swallowing dynamic import errors silently — at minimum log errors with structured context to stderr.
  3. Do not commit compiled artifacts (dist/) to VCS; if dist must be visible for LLM, keep it gitignored and visible only via .voderignore or ensure builds are reproducible and provenance is documented.
  4. Run an interactive npm audit / SCA scan locally and in CI; triage high/severe vulnerabilities promptly.

- Medium term
  1. Consider pinning critical dev tooling (vitest & coverage provider already aligned) or add test(s) verifying version alignment (per plan). Keep a documented ADR for any exact pins.
  2. Limit dynamic plugin execution surface: prefer a whitelist or explicit plugin list rather than arbitrary dynamic imports where feasible.
  3. For tests invoking shell/execSync, ensure inputs are sanitized, use ephemeral temp dirs, and log outputs. Prefer programmatic APIs over shell where possible.

- Long term
  1. Adopt reproducible builds (lockfile, lockfile verification), SLSA/attestation where appropriate, and enforce registry mirrors/trusted sources in CI (ADR already suggests this).
  2. Formalize a dependency upgrade & review process with ADRs for new/major devDependencies that expand runtime/test execution surfaces.

Confidence & completeness note:
- This assessment is based on the repository snapshots and source files present. I have not run `npm audit`, `npm test`, or static analyzers in this environment — such scans would materially improve the confidence and surface additional, concrete vulnerabilities (hence the ±10% on completeness). Running automated SCA and threat scans in CI or locally is the next recommended step to move from observability-based assessment to evidence-based remediation.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (20% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, publishable VCS state. Although the branch is synchronized with origin (no unpushed local commits), there are multiple unstaged/modified files and at least one untracked repository‑important file. Because uncommitted modifications exist the repo cannot be considered properly managed: until those changes are intentionally committed (or reverted) the working tree is dirty and not ready for release or stable work.
- Specifics:
  - Uncommitted changes (modified, not staged): .gitignore and several .voder metadata files (.voder/history.md, .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md, .voder/progress-chart.png, .voder/progress-log-areas.csv, .voder/progress-log.csv) plus docs/decisions/README.md. Presence of these unstaged modifications alone forces the score down (any unstaged/modified files → MAX 30%).
  - Untracked file: docs/libraries/usage/postcss.md is present but not added; untracked important project documentation reduces confidence further (apply an additional ~10–20% penalty).
  - Unpushed commits: None — branch is up to date with origin/main (good).
  - File tracking / ignore hygiene: .gitignore contains build artifacts (dist/, coverage/, etc.) which is correct; .voderignore negates dist/ for LLM visibility as intended. However, the working tree still contains changed metadata and an untracked docs file that need explicit VCS actions.
  
Summary: synchronization is fine (no unpushed commits), but the dirty working tree and untracked important file mean version control completeness is low — approximately 20% complete. Commit or revert the unstaged changes and either add or intentionally ignore the untracked docs file to move the project into a properly managed state.
