# Implementation Progress Assessment

**Generated:** 2025-08-21T16:47:28.934Z

![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (49% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What’s complete
  - Scaffolding and metadata exist: package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, ADRs, and various docs/decision records are present.
  - Core PostCSS feature implemented and exported: src/build/postcss.ts and src/index.ts expose createPostCSSConfig. This is the main implemented functional piece.
  - Basic build/test scripts defined (tsc & vitest) and dependencies largely modern and intentionally aligned (vitest ↔ @vitest/coverage-v8).
  - Static checks (type-check) succeed in parts; vitest runs have succeeded previously in isolated runs.

- What’s missing or blocking
  - Functional completeness is low (FUNCTIONALITY 20%): most required modules and factories listed in the UI-tools guide (vite-library, testing/*, linting/*, helpers, templates, utils) are not implemented. package.json exports point at dist/ files that are not produced until a successful build.
  - Test integration is broken (TESTING 15%): tests are fragile and currently block verification — tests/smoke.test.ts imports ../dist/src/index.js, causing tsc TS2307 during type-check because dist/ is not present at that stage. package-structure.test.ts also requires built files to exist. Coverage is effectively non-existent and far below required thresholds.
  - Version control is not clean (VERSION_CONTROL 25%): there are unstaged/modified tracked files (.voder/*) in the working tree; that violates the "ALL CHANGES COMMITTED" requirement and prevents a clean publishable state.
  - Code quality is moderate (CODE_QUALITY 60%): implemented code is small, focused, and typed, but repository coupling between tests and dist/ is a correctness/design smell. Missing lint/format scripts and config reduce process consistency.
  - Execution pipeline is partially working (EXECUTION 65%): tsc and vitest can run in isolation but the combined verify pipeline fails due to test import/build interactions and prior TS5055 overwrite conflicts that were mitigated partially.
  - Documentation is incomplete (DOCUMENTATION 45%): good ADRs and internal docs exist, but public README, API examples, CHANGELOG, and markdown-lint generator/instructions are missing.
  - Dependencies are in good shape (DEPENDENCIES 85%): modern versions and an earlier npm audit reported zero vulnerabilities; minor peer/dev version mismatch (jest-axe) should be reconciled.
  - Security posture is reasonable (SECURITY 80%): no obvious runtime security issues in current code; supply-chain and prepare-script risks should be audited/mitigated.

- Specific numeric references (from sub-assessments):
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 20% — core PostCSS implemented; majority of package features not yet implemented.
  - CODE_QUALITY: 60% — clean small code, but tests coupled to dist and missing lint/format infra.
  - TESTING: 15% — tests exist but block the pipeline and coverage is inadequate.
  - EXECUTION: 65% — individual tools run; combined verify fails due to test/build coupling.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 45% — ADRs good, consumer README/API missing.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 85% — modern and audited earlier; address minor version mismatch.
  - SECURITY: 80% — no high-risk code paths, but supply-chain and script execution require controls.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 25% — unstaged tracked changes in .voder/ files; working tree not clean.

## NEXT PRIORITY
- Immediate highest-priority actions (minimal, focused, order-sensitive):
  1. Clean the working tree so version control is sound (required before other validation):
     - Either commit or stash the modified .voder/* files so the repository is in a clean state. This addresses the VERSION_CONTROL assessment (25%) and prevents noise in verification runs.
  2. Fix the test that blocks verification (the single focused remediation that will unblock the verify pipeline):
     - Edit tests/smoke.test.ts to import the source module instead of the built artifact (change import '../dist/src/index.js' → import '../src/index' or equivalent TS source import).
     - Commit and push that single focused change.
  3. Re-run the combined verification pipeline and capture output:
     - npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test 2>&1 | tee .voder/history.md /dev/stderr
     - Inspect .voder/history.md. If the build fails with TS5055 overwrite conflicts again, follow the pre-existing remediation for build artifact conflicts (untrack any problematic tracked dist files or remove the offending file on disk before rebuild).
- Why these are top priority
  - The test import-from-dist issue is the immediate single point of failure that prevents the verify pipeline from completing and thus blocks all further incremental work (TESTING and EXECUTION are the critical gating concerns).
  - A clean git working tree is required by the project's version-control policy and avoids committing temporary metadata or causing inconsistent CI runs.
- After the immediate unblock (once verify runs):
  - Add a unit test for createPostCSSConfig (tests/build/postcss.test.ts).
  - Incrementally implement missing modules from the guide (one small feature + tests + commit + verify each).
  - Add README.md and minimal API examples.
  - Reconcile the minor dependency version mismatch (jest-axe) and document via ADR if changed.

Notes: Keep each change minimal and test-backed. Follow the previously prepared plan: one focused remediation per iteration, always run the combined verification pipeline and capture console output to .voder/history.md after each change.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (20% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Implemented / working elements
  - Package scaffolding exists: package.json (scripts, deps), tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts.
  - PostCSS factory implemented (src/build/postcss.ts) and exported from the public barrel (src/index.ts) as createPostCSSConfig — this core feature is present and type-checked.
  - Some repository documentation and ADRs present (decision records that guide implementation).
  - Basic build/test scripts defined in package.json (type-check, build, test, test:ci, clean, prepare, voder).

- Partially implemented / inconsistent areas that block functionality
  - Tests exist (tests/package-structure.test.ts and tests/smoke.test.ts) but are currently inconsistent with the repository state:
    - smoke.test.ts imports ../dist/src/index.js (expects compiled output). No dist/ outputs are present in the repo (and dist/ is gitignored), so the smoke test cannot pass until build artifacts are produced during the pipeline.
    - package-structure.test.ts validates package.json exports point to files under ./dist/ — again this depends on a successful build producing dist/*. The current repository lacks those artifacts; earlier build runs failed.
  - The public API and package.json exports point at compiled files under dist/ (main/exports reference ./dist/src/index.js), but most of the source modules that should compile to those dist files are missing:
    - The implementation guide and prompts list many modules (vite-library.ts, testing/*, linting/*, helpers, accessibility, setup, templates, utilities), but only the PostCSS source and index barrel are present.
  - Mandatory package features from the guides are not implemented:
    - jsdom testing utilities, accessibility helpers, Vitest jsdom config factory, component test helpers — not present in src.
    - Linting configuration factories (html/css/accessibility) are referenced in docs but not present in src exports.
    - Mandatory markdown-lint scripts (lint:md, lint:md:fix) and other quality scripts required by the universal guide are missing from package.json.
    - Dual export strategy (dedicated export paths like ./testing, ./prettier, etc.) is not implemented in package.json exports.
  - Build pipeline is not reliable: previous full verification runs produced TS build errors (TS5055) and tests reported missing modules during type-check. Until the build/test pipeline can produce dist outputs and tests import the right modules, integration and smoke tests will fail.

- Missing items preventing package to meet requirements
  - Many required source files and factories are unimplemented (testing, build/vite-library, linting, utils).
  - Tests that validate package structure and exports rely on compiled output; build step must succeed and produce the expected dist layout.
  - Scripts, tests, and ADR-enforced behaviors (markdown linting, type-safe Prettier config, coverage provider alignment tests) are not yet fully implemented/verified.
  - README and consumer-facing docs required by the spec are missing.

- Overall assessment
  - The repository contains correct scaffolding and one functional feature (PostCSS config), but the large majority of required features (testing utilities, linting config factories, export paths, tests that exercise compiled output, mandatory scripts) are unimplemented or not wired together.
  - At current state the package cannot satisfy its own tests or the "package export / structure" requirements because dist/ artifacts are not produced or present, and many source modules are missing.
  - Rough completion estimate: ~20% (±10%). The core PostCSS piece and scaffolding exist, but most functional surface area required by the implementation guide remains to be implemented and validated.

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (60% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The implemented code is small, focused, and follows several good practices:
  - TypeScript strict mode is enabled and NodeNext module resolution is used (appropriate for ESM).
  - The PostCSS factory is implemented in a simple, testable way and source imports use explicit .js extensions where appropriate for ESM output.
  - Small public API (src/index.ts) keeps a single responsibility and is easy to reason about.
- Immediate correctness issues that block a verification run:
  - tests/smoke.test.ts imports the compiled dist JS (../dist/src/index.js) from a TypeScript test. That causes TS2307 during type-check because TypeScript cannot find type declarations for that JS module while doing --noEmit type-checks. Tests should not require pre-built artifacts to type-check; they should import source modules (or use proper declaration files). This is the actual failing symptom in the last verification run.
  - The test suite and package design currently couple tests to build artifacts (dist/) which makes the developer/CI verification fragile and order-dependent.
- Other quality / maintainability problems and risks:
  - package.json has both peerDependencies and devDependencies containing overlapping items (e.g., autoprefixer listed in peers and devs). That is confusing and should be clarified (peer vs dev semantics).
  - package.json is missing many of the "mandatory" scripts and config entries required by the project's universal guide (lint, lint:fix, format, lint:md, lint:md:fix, verify, etc.). That’s a process/quality gap even if not a runtime bug.
  - Tests are sparse: only a package-structure and smoke test are present; unit tests for createPostCSSConfig and other planned utilities are missing. Coverage and edge-case testing requirements in the guide are not met.
  - Several package-level requirements from the universal guide (ESLint config file, Prettier config export, markdown lint glue, README/CHANGELOG templates) are not implemented. This reduces consistency and increases onboarding friction.
  - The package.json exports and types point into dist/src/ (i.e., "./dist/src/index.js") — unusual but consistent with current tsc outDir layout; however, it amplifies the fragile dist-dependency for tests and consumers unless build/test order is enforced.
  - There are some duplication/maintenance smells (e.g., optional guarded plugin code in vite.config.ts is defensive but adds indirection; also dependency version alignment ADRs indicate care is needed when changing test tooling).
- Minor code-style observations:
  - Source files use clear names and small responsibilities.
  - JSDoc and typed interfaces are used in the guide snippets — good for readability.
  - Lints/formatting are not yet enforced (no eslint/prettier config files in repo), so style consistency cannot be guaranteed.
- Overall assessment:
  - The implemented portion (PostCSS factory and minimal export barrel) is implemented cleanly and is low-risk.
  - The repository/test scaffold has a small but critical correctness issue (tests importing dist) and several process/consistency gaps that reduce overall quality and maintainability.
  - With a single focused fix to tests (import source in smoke test) and addition of basic lint/format script/configs and a unit test for createPostCSSConfig, the project would be in a much healthier state.

Summary: code is functionally simple and mostly correct for what has been implemented, but repository/test coupling to dist and missing tool/script infra reduce overall quality — estimate 60% complete for code quality (±15%).

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (15% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- There are a small number of Vitest suites present (tests/package-structure.test.ts and tests/smoke.test.ts). These cover two important concerns: package structure and a minimal smoke import, but they are extremely limited in scope.
- Tests are currently failing at the type‑check step: tsc reports TS2307 in tests/smoke.test.ts because that test imports ../dist/src/index.js (compiled output) even though dist/ is not present at type-check time. Because type-check runs before build in the verification pipeline, this causes the whole verification to fail before tests run.
- The package-structure test is also fragile: it asserts that package.json exports point to files under dist/ and that those files exist. That is a valid test but requires a prior build; as currently wired in the pipeline (type-check → build → tests), the smoke test's stale dist import blocks progression and will prevent the structure test from being meaningfully executed until build succeeds.
- Coverage: effectively no numeric coverage data is being produced / collected for the package yet. The test surface is tiny (a couple of simple assertions) and nowhere near the project’s stated thresholds (90%+ overall, 100% public API). Many mandatory test categories from the guide are missing (export-equivalence, package-installation integration, build configuration tests, accessibility helpers, linting config tests, etc.).
- Test configuration: Vitest is present and configured via package.json scripts, but there is no package-local vitest config in the repo yet (the guide expects createVitestJsdomConfig exports etc.), and tests rely on compiled outputs in ways that make local type-checking and incremental verification brittle.
- Overall: tests exist but are minimal, currently blocking the verification pipeline due to an import-from-dist issue, and coverage is far below the stated project requirements.

Summary:
- Passing? No — the current verification run fails at type-check due to tests/smoke.test.ts importing dist files.
- Coverage adequacy? No — effectively zero measured coverage and far below required thresholds.
- Motionable shortcoming: tests import compiled artifacts (dist) during type-check; this should be adjusted (e.g., import source files during type-check / author tests that work pre-build, or arrange the pipeline so build occurs before type-check of tests that import dist).
- Estimated completion toward required testing state: 15% ±10%.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (65% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The package is partially validated but not fully runnable end-to-end. Type checking (tsc --noEmit) succeeds in the current tree, and several pieces (PostCSS factory, export barrel, guard in vite.config) are implemented and earlier test runs reported passing Vitest runs. However the combined verification pipeline (type-check → build → test) is not passing right now:
  - A recent verification run failed during TypeScript resolution for tests: tests/smoke.test.ts imports ../dist/src/index.js but dist/ is not present (and is intentionally gitignored), causing TS2307 "Cannot find module" during tsc.
  - Earlier there were TS5055 build overwrite conflicts from compiled artifacts under dist/, which required adjusting tsconfig and cleaning outputs; those issues were partially addressed but the smoke test still blocks the full pipeline.
  - package.json scripts exist for build/test workflows, and tsc/vitest run in isolation, but the required end-to-end "verify" sequence is failing due to the test import and previous build artifact interactions.

Summary: key tooling runs (tsc, vitest) work individually in parts, but the standardized verification pipeline does not currently complete. Remaining single-point failures (smoke test importing dist, and earlier dist-related build conflicts) must be resolved before the build/test pipeline is fully validated.

<scratchpad>
Files present relevant to documentation:
- docs/decisions/* (several ADRs + README listing) — good ADR coverage
- docs/libraries/usage/postcss.md and voder-dev-config.md — useful library usage docs
- prompts/... contains implementation guides but these are internal prompts (not user-facing)
- No README.md at repo root or package README.md in package root
- No CHANGELOG.md
- No .markdownlint.json (required pattern: generated from @voder/dev-config)
- No API reference docs for the package exports (only in implementation guides)
- README isolation requirement: README must be self-contained and reference published content only
- Tests and code exist but public API surface is minimal (only createPostCSSConfig exported)
- package.json has description, license, but no README or consumer docs

Strengths:
- Strong ADR coverage and decision documentation (many accepted ADRs, decision README)
- Some usage docs (PostCSS writeup and voder-dev-config usage)
- Implementation guides provide in-depth developer-oriented docs (prompts/development-ui-tools.md)

Gaps / Risks:
- Missing public-facing README.md for package — blocks consumer onboarding and violates README isolation guidance
- No API reference documenting exported functions/types (e.g., createPostCSSConfig signature, examples)
- No CHANGELOG.md or release notes template present
- No generated .markdownlint.json or script/notes to generate it (required by standards)
- Documentation mixed: extensive internal docs/prompts are present but these are internal and must not be referenced by README
- No "Security posture" section in a public README (policy requires one)
- No docs for running package-level scripts (lint:md, format, verify) as required

Priority next-doc actions (minimal, focused):
1. Add a self-contained README.md at repo root (package README) using the provided template: purpose, install, quick usage, API example, security posture, license (UNLICENSED) — avoid internal links.
2. Add minimal API docs for exported API (short section in README or docs/api.md) showing usage examples for createPostCSSConfig.
3. Add CHANGELOG.md (template file) and mention where to find ADRs (but do not link to internal, only summarize).
4. Add a small script or instructions to generate .markdownlint.json from @voder/dev-config (or include generated config committed if allowed).
5. Add a short "Contributing / Developer setup" section that references npm scripts (verify, test, build) — keep it consumer-safe and self-contained.

Estimated completeness: low–moderate. ADRs and some library usage docs are good, but the missing README and API docs are significant blockers for consumers.
</scratchpad>

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (45% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository has very strong decision-level documentation (ADRs) and a couple of useful library-usage pages, plus comprehensive internal implementation guides — excellent for maintainers and LLM agents. However, it is missing essential consumer-facing documentation: there is no package README.md, no concise public API reference for exported functions/types, no CHANGELOG, and no generated markdown-lint configuration or explicit developer onboarding README that follows the project's README-isolation policy. To be consumer-ready and meet the project's mandatory documentation standards, add a self-contained README (with install, usage, API examples, security posture, and license), short API docs (or an API section in the README), a CHANGELOG template, and the markdownlint generation/instructions as high priority.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Summary: Overall the package dev- and peer-dependencies look modern and intentionally aligned (notably vitest ↔ @vitest/coverage-v8 are version-aligned). An earlier non-interactive npm audit (run during setup) reported zero vulnerabilities for the dependency tree, which supports the claim that there are no known critical security issues at that time. Based on the static manifest and repository history, there are no obvious stale or highly vulnerable packages, but this assessment is limited because I cannot run live audits or fetch the latest registry metadata here.

- Freshness / currency:
  - TypeScript (^5.9.2), Vitest (^3.2.4), @vitest/coverage-v8 (^3.2.4), jsdom (^26.x), and @testing-library packages are on modern major versions appropriate for a 2025 codebase — these look up-to-date.
  - PostCSS v8 + Autoprefixer v10 are widely used and appropriate for the PostCSS ecosystem; Vite peer ^6.0.0 is also a recent major.
  - markdownlint-cli2 ^0.18.1 and other tooling are recent.

- Security vulnerabilities:
  - Project history indicates an `npm audit` run reported zero vulnerabilities. That is a good sign, but security state can change rapidly; periodic audits are recommended.
  - No obvious high‑risk packages (native binary installers, unmaintained tiny libs) stand out from the manifest alone.

- Compatibility / alignment issues to address:
  - Peer vs dev mismatch: jest-axe appears in devDependencies as ^10.0.0, while peerDependencies lists jest-axe ^9.0.0. This is a potential compatibility/version-alignment problem that can cause confusing peer warnings for consumers or runtime mismatch. Decide whether the package should require jest-axe@^9 (change devDep) or update the peer range to accept ^10 if compatible — and document the decision (ADR).
  - Peer ranges are generally permissive (caret ranges) which is good, but ensure critical tooling that requires exact alignment (e.g., coverage provider → vitest) remains aligned; the repository already enforces vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 alignment.
  - Ensure Node engine compatibility: docs indicate Node >= 22.6.0 for TypeScript config loading; confirm any consumers meet that constraint (not a dependency issue in this package, but relevant for dev-tooling).

- Recommendations (minimal, prioritized):
  1. Fix the jest-axe version mismatch: either relax the peerDependencies entry to allow ^10 or pin the devDependency to ^9 if that is the supported runtime. Add a brief ADR documenting the choice if you change package.json.
  2. Re-run npm audit and npm outdated in CI / locally periodically: `npm audit --json` and `npm outdated --json` to detect new vulnerabilities or updated packages.
  3. Keep vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 updated together (the repo already follows this policy).

- Confidence: medium-high (85% ±10%). The manifest and project history (including an earlier audit with zero vulnerabilities) indicate a healthy dependency set, but this assessment cannot detect issues introduced after that audit or hidden transitive vulnerabilities without running live tooling.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary
  - The codebase as-present contains no obvious high‑severity application-layer vulnerabilities (no network calls, no credential handling, no external API keys) and most risky operations (tests / tooling) are restricted to devDependencies. However, there are several supply‑chain and operational risks to mitigate; some patterns (execSync usage in examples, prepare script, dynamic imports, test behaviors) require attention to avoid introduction or exploitation of vulnerabilities. This assessment is based on repository contents and static inspection only (no dynamic scans or dependency vulnerability database checks performed).

- Supply-chain and dependency risks
  - Many tools are declared as devDependencies and peerDependencies (vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, postcss, autoprefixer, jsdom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2, etc.). These packages, if compromised, can affect developer machines and CI. Mitigation:
    - Ensure a lockfile (package-lock.json / pnpm-lock.yaml) is committed and used in CI; verify integrity before install.
    - Run automated SCA (npm audit / Snyk / Dependabot) and follow ADR-0007 guidance for registry mirrors / audits.
    - Prefer pinned or vetted versions for high‑risk tooling (coverage providers, test runners) and document reasoning in ADRs when using caret ranges.
  - prepare script risk: package.json defines "prepare": "node ../../setup-package-docs.js". npm runs prepare on install; executing a local script can run arbitrary JS code on developers' machines or CI during install. Mitigation:
    - Restrict prepare to safe, well-reviewed scripts. Document and audit the referenced script. Consider requiring manual invocation or gating it behind an env var in CI if not strictly required.

- Execution of shell/child processes
  - Some examples/docs/tests (in guides) use execSync to run npm pack / npm install / node. ExecSync with interpolated inputs can be a command‑injection vector if any part of the command is influenced by untrusted input. In this repo, examples appear to use static commands, but tests that create temp directories and run pack/install should:
    - Avoid interpolating untrusted data into shell commands.
    - Use argument arrays or spawnSync with execFile when possible.
    - Validate and sanitize any string used in shell invocation.
  - Tests or scripts that run arbitrary commands should be run in CI with least‑privilege and in isolated environments.

- Test/runtime module loading risks
  - tests/smoke.test.ts imports compiled output via import('../dist/src/index.js') which executes module initialization code. Importing modules during tests runs any top‑level code in the module — if future modules include side effects or network/file operations at top-level, tests could cause unexpected behavior. Mitigation:
    - Keep top-level module code side‑effect free; prefer factory functions/classes to explicit side effects.
    - If module initialization must perform actions, ensure they are guarded and safe in test environments.

- File system writes and repo cleanliness
  - The project has a strict "console-first / no output files in repo" policy; ensure no code writes logs or artifacts into the repository (tests, scripts, utilities). Any temporary files must be in OS temp dirs and cleaned up. Mitigation:
    - Code review for any fs.writeFileSync/writeFile usage (including third‑party tooling invoked during prepare) to ensure outputs go to temp dirs or are gitignored.
    - Enforce pre-commit or CI checks scanning for writes to forbidden paths (the repository's .gitignore patterns are present and appropriate).

- Dynamic imports and optional plugin handling
  - vite.config.ts dynamically imports an optional plugin with try/catch; this is safe in general but if a plugin is loaded from an untrusted source or an attacker can influence module resolution, it could execute code. Mitigation:
    - Only rely on dependencies from trusted registries and validate package integrity.
    - Avoid loading plugins from user-supplied module paths.

- jsdom and DOM sanitization
  - Testing utilities use jsdom and helpers that operate on DOM elements. Risk is mainly XSS-like issues if untrusted HTML is inserted with innerHTML. Current helpers append created containers and call component.mount; ensure consumers and internal helpers use textContent or sanitized insertion. Mitigation:
    - Document that render helpers operate in jsdom and that components should not use unsafe innerHTML without sanitization.
    - Add unit tests for any helpers that could expose unsafe content handling.

- Use of experimental Node flags (TypeScript config loading)
  - ADRs reference using NODE_OPTIONS="--experimental-strip-types" for TS config files. Experimental flags may change behavior; avoid relying on them for security‑sensitive config loading. Mitigation:
    - Keep such usage documented and gated; prefer stable mechanisms for production CI.
    - Ensure TypeScript config files do not contain secrets or execute code with side effects.

- Secrets & sensitive data
  - Repository .gitignore excludes .env; ensure no secrets are committed. Mitigation:
    - Scan the repo for accidental secrets (git history) and rotate any exposed credentials.
    - Add a pre-commit or CI secret-scan step.

- Least-privilege and sandboxing
  - Developer and CI operations that run tests or scripts should use least privilege (no unnecessary network/file access) and run in isolated containers/VMs to limit blast radius from compromised dev tooling.

- Recommendations / prioritized actions
  1. Verify and commit lockfile(s) and enable SCA scans (npm audit, GitHub Dependabot/Snyk) in CI. Ensure ADR-0007 supply-chain practices are followed.
  2. Audit and lock/validate the prepare script (../../setup-package-docs.js). If it must run on npm install, ensure its behavior is idempotent and secure; otherwise, require manual invocation.
  3. Avoid executing shell commands with interpolated inputs; review all uses of execSync/child_process in tests and docs and harden them or use safer APIs.
  4. Ensure all top-level modules are side-effect free; tests that import modules should not trigger I/O or network actions.
  5. Add checks in CI to enforce no writes to repository root (only allow temp dir writes) and to verify .gitignore covers generated artifacts.
  6. Periodically review devDependencies for critical vulnerabilities and apply pinned/upgraded versions per ADRs; add automated dependency alignment tests where required (e.g., vitest ↔ coverage provider).
  7. Document and enforce developer guidance around sandboxed test execution and running npm install only from verified registries.

- Limitations of this assessment
  - This is a static review of repository contents only. No dynamic dependency vulnerability scan, runtime execution, or SCA database lookup was performed. The percentage score reflects confidence based on file inspection, not on live scanning results. Run automated audits and dynamic tests to obtain a more complete security posture.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, publishable state: there are unstaged/modified files in the working tree. Because any uncommitted changes immediately violate the "ALL CHANGES COMMITTED" requirement, the overall version-control completeness is low.
- Specifics:
  - Uncommitted modifications: 7 modified files shown by `git status` (all under .voder/): .voder/history.md, .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md, .voder/progress-chart.png, .voder/progress-log-areas.csv, .voder/progress-log.csv. These are tracked files with local modifications that have not been staged/committed.
  - No unpushed commits: the branch is reported as "up to date with 'origin/main'", so there are no local commits waiting to be pushed.
  - No untracked important files: file-tracking summary reports zero untracked files; .gitignore appears to cover build artifacts (dist/, node_modules/, coverage/, etc.), which is correct.
  - Build artifacts and temp files appear properly ignored; .voderignore intentionally exposes dist/ for LLM inspection—this is consistent with policy.
- Consequence: Because uncommitted changes exist, this repository cannot be considered fully managed under version control (fails requirements 1 and 4). Until those changes are either committed (or deliberately reverted/cleaned), the repository should be treated as in-flight and not publishable.
- Recommended immediate actions (not executed here): stage & commit or stash/revert the modified .voder files as appropriate so the working tree is clean; then re-run verification and push any new commits if created.
