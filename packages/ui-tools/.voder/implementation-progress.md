![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (77.13% ± 8% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The package implements the core UI tooling features and tests well, but code-quality enforcement and repository hygiene require attention. Key gaps are ESLint/format enforcement, some uncommitted lint fixes, and branch synchronization risk which currently prevent completion.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Apply and commit ESLint autofix results, install dev tools, then run npm run verify and resolve remaining lint/type failures until the pipeline is green.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (88% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Core UI tooling features are largely implemented: PostCSS/autoprefixer factory, Vite ESM library config, Vitest jsdom config, DOM testing helpers, accessibility/assertion helpers, and a hardened jsdom test setup are present and well-tested. A few non-functional gaps remain (linting config exports and optional template artifacts) that prevent 100% compliance with the implementation guide.
- Implemented features: createPostCSSConfig (autoprefixer), createViteLibraryConfig (ESM-only Vite factory), createVitestJsdomConfig (jsdom + coverage), DOM helpers (renderComponent, simulateClick, wait helpers), accessibility helpers (expectAccessible, getAccessibilityViolations, expectAriaAttributes, expectFocusable, accessibilityTests), and robust test environment setup with Canvas/TextEncoder shims and common browser mocks.
- Distribution artifacts exist under dist/ (compiled .js and .d.ts), and package.json exports point at dist/ paths that match files in the repository — package-structure and package-exports tests are provided to validate this.
- Comprehensive Vitest tests exist for build factories, testing helpers, accessibility utilities, and jsdom setup; historical runs indicate tests have been made to pass (noting earlier iterations fixed color-contrast expectations in JSDOM).
- Accessibility behavior is explicit about JSDOM limitations (color-contrast) and tests correctly exclude that rule where appropriate; the package documents and codifies this limitation in helpers and tests.
- Missing or incomplete items vs the guide: linting configuration factories (html/css/accessibility) and template example files described in the implementation guide are not exported from src/index and appear absent from src — the guide expected these to be part of the package API.
- Some repository hygiene and tooling work remains (ESLint autofix changes staged/uncommitted, .eslintignore present as untracked), but these are process/quality issues rather than functional regressions in runtime API.
- The package includes verification scripts in package.json and devDependencies for required tooling; however full 'verify' runs previously encountered lint-related failures (addressable) — again affecting dev workflow rather than core runtime functionality.

**Next Steps:**
- Export and implement the linting configuration factories (createHTMLLintConfig, createCSSLintConfig, createAccessibilityLintConfig) from src and add their unit tests so the package fulfills the 'linting configurations' responsibility described in the guide.
- Add the template/example files (vitest.config.ts, vite.config.ts, test-setup.jsdom.ts) to the repository templates/ directory or confirm they are intentionally omitted; update README and package exports accordingly.
- Run a full local verification (npm ci && npm run verify) and address any remaining test or build regressions; commit ESLint autofix changes and ensure tsconfig.eslint.json scope prevents analysis of generated artifacts.
- Add a small unit test validating the Vitest guard behavior in setup (ensuring test-only patches run only under Vitest) as planned, to make the test environment behavior explicit and covered by tests.
- Once changes are made, re-run the test suite and ensure the package-structure and package-exports tests pass against the dist/ files, then commit and push the verified changes.

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (45% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Overall the codebase has most of the required quality tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, markdown lint scripts, verify script) and test suites, but several mandatory project guidance items are not fully implemented or consistently enforced (TypeScript config does not extend @voder/dev-config, a custom .markdownlint.json is present instead of using the dev-config generator, there are uncommitted lint fixes and an extra .eslintignore). Because the project guidance mandates specific configurations and use of dev-config sources, the score is capped and reduced for incomplete compliance and partial enforcement.
- Core tooling is present: ESLint (eslint.config.js), Prettier (prettier.config.js re-export), Vitest (vitest.config.ts + tests), and npm scripts (lint, lint:fix, format, test, test:ci, verify) exist and align with guidance.
- ESLint: package-local eslint.config.js imports @voder/dev-config layers and adds ignores; tsconfig.eslint.json was added to limit scope — good. However lint autofix produced uncommitted changes and there is an untracked .eslintignore file (deprecated) that suggests ignore handling is inconsistent.
- Prettier: prettier.config.js correctly re-exports @voder/dev-config/prettier as required by guidance.
- TypeScript config: tsconfig.json does NOT extend '@voder/dev-config/typescript/base' as mandated by the guidance; this is a direct deviation from the project's required standard.
- Markdown linting: .markdownlint.json exists in repo root with custom rules instead of being generated from @voder/dev-config as the docs require (guidance mandates using dev-config's markdown rules and generator).
- Verify pipeline: a comprehensive 'verify' script exists (type-check, lint:fix, lint:md:fix, format, build, test:ci), so enforcement is available, but earlier runs showed lint failures and manual intervention — enforcement is present but not yet consistently green/automated.
- Tests and coverage: Vitest configuration factories and many tests are implemented and organized per guidance. Coverage thresholds are configured. This demonstrates strong testing practices.
- Repository hygiene: .gitignore includes dist/ and other artifacts; .voderignore negates dist/ for LLM visibility as expected. Some build artifacts (dist/) exist in workspace (visible to LLM) but are gitignored as required.
- Documentation and ADRs: ADRs and README are present and align with project policies, demonstrating documentation-driven decisions.

**Next Steps:**
- Update tsconfig.json to extend '@voder/dev-config/typescript/base' (per guidance) and ensure include/exclude entries match the dev-config expectations; run type-check and tests.
- Regenerate .markdownlint.json using @voder/dev-config's markdown linter helper (or remove the custom .markdownlint.json) and ensure lint:md and lint:md:fix use that generated config.
- Apply and commit any remaining ESLint autofix changes (git add -A && git commit -m "fix(lint): apply eslint fixes to src and tests"); remove or consolidate the untracked .eslintignore (if redundant) and commit the change.
- Run a clean local verification: npm ci && npm run verify, fix any infra or lint failures until verify completes successfully and consistently.
- Consider adding a small automated check (CI or local pre-push script invoked by the dev workflow) that runs npm run verify or at least lint/type-check before pushing to ensure enforcement is consistent.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (88% ± 16% COMPLETE)
- The test suite is well-populated, exercises core build, testing and accessibility helpers, and a recent full run completed green; however there were recent intermittent failures and coverage metrics are not visible here, so some risk remains.
- Recent history shows a full green run: a verification run executed tsc/build/vitest and reported all tests passing (11 test files, 17 tests).
- Test coverage targets are declared (Vitest coverage thresholds 90% across categories) but no consolidated coverage report or numeric coverage percentage is visible in the repository snapshot.
- Test categories present and exercised: build/postcss, vite library config, testing helpers, testing setup, vitest-jsdom config, accessibility helpers, smoke/package-structure/package-exports validations.
- There were prior failures (color-contrast expectation, ESLint-driven test iterations) which were addressed; this indicates previous flakiness that has recently been resolved but may still represent risk until CI consistently reproduces green runs.
- Package-structure and package-exports tests validate dist/ artifacts and package.json exports — these rely on built artifacts and the presence of package-lock.json which can make runs environment-sensitive.
- No package-installation integration test (pack + install into a temp consumer) is present despite being recommended for configuration packages; that reduces end-to-end packaging confidence.
- Some tests depend on environment state (canvas/TextEncoder mocks, jsdom behavior). The code includes guarded patches but these environment-sensitive patches can still cause variability across runtimes.

**Next Steps:**
- Run the full verify pipeline locally (npm run verify) and capture/save the coverage report to confirm actual coverage numbers meet the declared thresholds.
- Add an isolated package-installation integration test (pack + install into a temp consumer) to validate real consumer import/install experience.
- Add a small unit test asserting the jsdom setup guard behavior to ensure test-only patches only run under Vitest and to reduce flakiness across runtimes.
- Ensure the project CI executes npm run verify on a clean environment and confirm repeated green runs to raise confidence above current levels.
- If coverage falls short, add targeted tests to public API surfaces to reach the declared coverage thresholds (especially public exports and error scenarios).

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (78% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- TypeScript build and Vitest test suites have run successfully in recent executions, and compiled artifacts exist in dist/. However the full verification pipeline (npm run verify) is not consistently green due to ESLint/parser and lint-fix issues and there are uncommitted working-tree changes. Overall the core build+test steps work, but repository-level verification (linting + automated fixes) still requires attention.
- TypeScript compilation (tsc) and Vitest runs succeeded in recent recorded runs: a later run reported 11 test files (17 tests) with all tests passing.
- Dist/ contains compiled JS and type declarations; package.json exports point to ./dist/ and tests validate those paths (package-structure/package-exports tests exist and were exercised).
- A prior full `npm run verify` failed on eslint --fix with ~46 problems (parser/type issues); this indicates ESLint configuration / project scope (parserOptions.project) issues rather than runtime code failures.
- Console-first diagnostics (TextEncoder patch messages) were emitted during tests — informational and guarded in setup; not a fatal runtime error.
- Git working tree currently has many modified files (22) and several untracked files; these changes are not all staged/committed which means the repository is not in a fully validated committed state.
- Dev tooling availability was intermittent (earlier 'eslint: command not found'); devDependencies were installed subsequently but lint-related failures still block the end-to-end verify step.

**Next Steps:**
- Install dev tooling reproducibly: run `npm ci --silent --no-audit --no-fund` from the package root to ensure eslint, vitest and other tools are present.
- Run core validation locally step-by-step to reproduce and capture output: `npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test` and confirm tests pass.
- Run ESLint in the restricted project scope using the ESLint tsconfig: `npx eslint "src/**" "tests/**" --ext .ts,.js --parser-options "project=./tsconfig.eslint.json" --fix` and inspect remaining errors.
- If ESLint autofix changed files, `git add -A` and commit (`git commit -m "fix(lint): apply eslint fixes to src and tests"`) then re-run `npm run verify` to validate the full pipeline.
- If `npm run verify` still fails due to parser/project scope, adjust `tsconfig.eslint.json` to include only `src` and `tests` and exclude `dist`, `build`, `coverage`, `node_modules`, then re-run ESLint and verify.
- Once verify is green, stage & push the commits: `git push origin main` to publish the validated state.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (82% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Documentation is strong and mostly complete: clear README with examples, ADRs and decision records, usage docs for key libraries, and good testing/verification guidance. Missing a formal API reference, CONTRIBUTING and CHANGELOG files, and a concise developer onboarding doc.
- README.md: well-written, includes purpose, quick start, examples (vite, vitest, postcss), scripts/verification sequence, security posture, and license. Node version requirement is explicit.
- ADRs: comprehensive decision records are present in docs/decisions/, documenting rationale for key architectural choices and dependency decisions.
- Usage docs: docs/libraries/usage contains helpful writeups for axe-core, PostCSS, and dev-config; templates/ directory and examples are present in source for vite/vitest/test-setup usage.
- Testing guidance: repository contains detailed testing strategy and examples (JSDOM limitations, color-contrast caveats) both in prompts and in tests, useful for consumers and maintainers.
- Markdown linting: policy and generation workflow are documented (generate .markdownlint.json via dev-config); .markdownlint.json exists at repo root.
- Type information: TypeScript sources and dist .d.ts files exist, which could be used to generate API docs, but no generated API reference site or dedicated API markdown present.
- Developer onboarding gap: there is no CONTRIBUTING.md or short developer quick-start that consolidates commands (install, verify, lint, test) and explains peer dependency installation for consumers.
- CHANGELOG / release notes: no CHANGELOG.md present (templates referenced in guides but not instantiated), which would help consumers track changes.
- Some documentation is split across many files (prompts/universal-guide, prompts/development-ui-tools, docs/decisions) which is rich but might be overwhelming; a concise 'what to read first' developer overview would help.
- Examples are practical but could be expanded into a small API reference (function signatures, parameter descriptions, return types) for exported factories and testing helpers to reduce friction for consumers.

**Next Steps:**
- Add a generated API reference (markdown) for public exports: create docs/api/*.md or a single API.md summarizing exported factories, helpers, types, and example usage for each (createViteLibraryConfig, createPostCSSConfig, createVitestJsdomConfig, renderComponent, expectAccessible, setupJsdomTestEnvironment).
- Add CONTRIBUTING.md with quick local setup steps (npm ci, Node version, running npm run verify, lint with tsconfig.eslint.json) and guidance for adding ADRs and dependency changes.
- Create CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog style) and add a small workflow note on when/where to update it (per ADR or release process).
- Add a short developer 'onboarding' README or section in README (Getting started for contributors) that consolidates common commands, where to find ADRs, and how to run tests locally.
- Add a brief peer-dependencies section in README (or docs/usage) listing required peer deps and install commands so consumers can quickly satisfy runtime/tool peers.
- Consider generating API docs from TypeScript declarations (typedoc or similar) and either commit markdown or add a simple script to emit markdown into docs/api/ as part of the prepare/build documentation step.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (90% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Dependencies present a healthy state: no runtime dependencies (zero attack surface at runtime), peerDependencies and devDependencies are reasonably recent and compatible with each other (Vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 alignment, jsdom, jest-axe, postcss/autoprefixer). Regular audits and lockfile verification are still recommended.
- There are no "dependencies" (runtime deps) declared — package is dev/config-focused which reduces runtime attack surface.
- Peer dependencies are declared for runtime/tooling consumers: autoprefixer:^10, jest-axe:^9, jsdom:^26, postcss:^8, vite:^6, vitest:^3.2.0 — these align with devDependencies present.
- DevDependencies are recent and largely compatible: vitest ^3.2.4, @vitest/coverage-v8 ^3.2.4 (provider alignment present), jsdom ^26.1.0, jest-axe ^9.0.0, axe-core ^4.10.3, postcss ^8.5.6, autoprefixer ^10.4.21, typescript ^5.9.2, eslint ^9.33.0, prettier ^3.6.2.
- The repository includes a package-lock.json and tests that assert version alignment for key packages (version-alignment test), which is a good practice for reproducibility.
- No obvious mismatches detected between peerDependencies and devDependencies in package.json that would immediately break consumer expectations, but peer vs dev duplication should be reviewed periodically.
- Security posture cannot be guaranteed without running `npm audit` or SCA tooling; presence of relatively recent versions reduces risk but does not eliminate it.

**Next Steps:**
- Run `npm ci` (or `npm install`) followed by `npm audit` and review any high/critical findings; address via upgrades or ADRs as needed.
- Run `npm outdated` (or use your preferred dependency management tool) to identify available updates, prioritizing security and compatibility patches for vitest/jsdom/axe-core/jest-axe.
- Keep the lockfile (package-lock.json) committed and ensure the CI runs regular dependency audits and the existing version-alignment test to detect drift.
- Consider pinning exact versions for tightly-coupled tool pairs (e.g., vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8) if reproducibility issues arise; document those pins with ADRs as required by policy.
- Automate periodic dependency checks (weekly/monthly) and integrate SCA results into the verification workflow before commits are pushed.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (86% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Overall the codebase follows good secure-by-default patterns for a development tooling package: no network calls at runtime, test-only patches are gated, no file writes into the repository, and the repo documents supply-chain checks. The main residual risks are supply-chain (devDependency) exposure, a small attack surface in test helpers that execute external commands in example code, and test-environment patches that could leak into non-test runtimes if environment detection is misconfigured.
- No runtime network or telemetry code in library exports: package functions build/test configuration and DOM helpers operate in-memory and do not perform network I/O.
- Test environment patches (TextEncoder, Canvas 2D shim, global mocks) are guarded by an `isVitest` check, reducing the chance of leaking into production, but rely on environment variables/global markers; misconfiguration could cause unintended patching.
- No code in src writes files into the repository. Project policy enforces console-first diagnostics and .gitignore for build outputs which reduces risk of sensitive data being committed.
- Dev/test tooling and scripts (prepare, examples) can run npm/child-process commands (examples reference npm pack / npm install via execSync in docs/examples). If executed in CI or a malicious environment, those commands could fetch and run untrusted code — tests that perform packing/installing should run in isolated environments and be audited.
- Package.json contains many devDependencies/peerDependencies. This surface increases supply-chain risk; audit & lockfile hygiene are required (project has ADRs and tests referencing package-lock.json but running `npm audit` regularly is recommended).
- Accessibility helpers call into jest-axe/axe-core on DOM nodes. This is safe for trusted test fixtures, but the code and README correctly document that helpers should not be used with untrusted HTML (XSS risk if consumers hand untrusted markup to helpers).
- Dynamic optional imports (vite plugin) and shallow-merging of user-provided config are implemented safely (no eval/new Function). However merging consumer-supplied plugin arrays means consumers can inject arbitrary plugin objects — acceptable for config libraries but should be documented and validated by consumers.

**Next Steps:**
- Run a full supply-chain assessment: `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` and review package-lock.json; consider pinning especially critical testing/coverage tooling and document rationale in ADRs.
- Ensure any tests or examples that run `npm pack`, `npm install` or other child_process operations are executed only in isolated CI runners or gated environments; add explicit warnings in test code and/or limit such tests to opt-in (or skip by default).
- Harden test-environment guard: prefer checking `typeof globalThis.__vitest__ === 'boolean'` or use a small internal marker set by setup rather than relying solely on process.env.VITEST, and add a unit test that verifies the guard does not apply when not under Vitest.
- Add an automated periodic dependency-scan job (external to repo per policy) and include an ADR documenting dependency update policy and emergency rollback procedures for critical vulnerabilities.
- Document and enforce a policy that no package scripts or prepare steps execute unreviewed external code during casual `npm install` (e.g., require maintainers to run `npm ci` at repo root in a controlled environment).

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (60% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- Repository is healthy and actively developed but version-control posture needs tightening: no conflicts or corruption, core sources and configs are tracked and ignores are correct, but the branch is 13 commits ahead and there are many local modifications/untracked helper files which increases risk for collaboration.
- No merge conflicts or repository corruption reported in git status; working tree is usable.
- Critical source files (src/, tests/, configs like package.json, tsconfig.json, README.md) are tracked.
- .gitignore contains appropriate rules for node_modules/, dist/, build/, coverage/, and temporary outputs; .voderignore intentionally negates dist/ for agent visibility.
- There are 22 modified files not staged and 3 untracked files (including .eslintignore and a docs markdown) — active work in progress but these should be committed soon.
- Branch is ahead of origin/main by 13 commits. Being this far ahead poses collaboration/merge risk in trunk-based workflows.
- No indication of large numbers of build artifacts being accidentally tracked (dist/ is listed as ignored).
- Pipeline/scripts and ADRs are present; many small, iterative commits indicate healthy active development.

**Next Steps:**
- Commit or stash the current local changes (run the planned eslint autofix commit) to keep working tree clean before further work.
- Run the full verify pipeline locally (npm run verify) and fix any failures, then push commits to origin to reduce divergence from remote.
- Remove or consolidate .eslintignore if redundant with eslint.config.js (commit removal), and ensure tsconfig.eslint.json only includes src/tests to avoid linting generated outputs.
- Avoid accumulating an 8+ commit local-only backlog; push incremental validated commits to remote frequently to reduce merge risk.
- Before pushing, run a quick sanity check to ensure no build artifacts (dist/, coverage/) are staged/tracked.
