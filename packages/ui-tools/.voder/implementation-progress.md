# Implementation Progress Assessment

**Generated:** 2025-08-21T15:26:22.072Z

![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (54% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What’s complete
  - Core scaffolding and metadata: package.json, tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts, ADRs (docs/decisions/) and developer guidance exist and are high quality.
  - One implemented public API: createPostCSSConfig is implemented and exported (src + compiled dist). Dist contains compiled artifacts and compiled tests, and smoke + package-structure tests that import dist exist and have run successfully in prior verification.
  - Dev dependency management and supply-chain checks: devDependencies/peerDependencies are present and your previous audit reported zero vulnerabilities.
  - Build/test scripts exist (type-check, build, test, test:ci), and the build + tests have passed previously (before the most recent TS overwrite error).

- What’s missing or incomplete (major gaps)
  - Functionality: Only a small slice of the promised feature set is implemented (PostCSS factory). Major package responsibilities are unimplemented: Vite library factory, Vitest jsdom factory, testing helpers, accessibility utilities, HTML/CSS linting factories, templates, and the complete export surface (dual-export strategy). (FUNCTIONALITY: 25%)
  - Testing: Tests are minimal and focused on packaging and a single smoke assertion. No unit tests for createPostCSSConfig, no integration/package-installation tests, no export-equivalence tests, and no meaningful coverage. Current tests will not meet the project’s coverage policy (required ≥90%). (TESTING: 10%)
  - Version control cleanliness: Working tree has uncommitted modifications (several .voder files). That prevents a clean, publishable state and must be resolved. (VERSION_CONTROL: 25%)
  - Documentation: Strong internal docs (ADRs, prompts) but lacking consumer‑facing docs: README.md, CHANGELOG, concise API documentation, and .markdownlint.json are missing. (DOCUMENTATION: 55%)
  - Code quality & execution risks: Code quality for the narrow implemented surface is reasonable, but the repository relies on compiled artifacts in dist which masks missing source files and caused build friction (TS5055). The recent TS5055 build failure shows build configuration fragility that needs confirmation-fixed. (CODE_QUALITY: 65%, EXECUTION: 70%)
  - Security & dependencies: Good — private package, lockfile, zero audit findings; follow-up recommendations remain (untracked/committed build artifacts, lifecycle scripts, SCA monitoring). (DEPENDENCIES: 100%, SECURITY: 85%)

- Sub-assessment references (for traceability)
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 25%
  - CODE_QUALITY: 65%
  - TESTING: 10%
  - EXECUTION: 70%
  - DOCUMENTATION: 55%
  - DEPENDENCIES: 100%
  - SECURITY: 85%
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 25%

## NEXT PRIORITY
Immediate next steps (ordered by priority — address the lowest-scoring areas first):

1. Clean and synchronize version control (critical, low friction)
   - Commit or intentionally stash the .voder metadata edits so working tree is clean:
     - If the .voder changes are meant to be kept, stage and commit them with a clear message.
     - If they are transient, stash or discard as appropriate.
   - Ensure there are no unstaged or uncommitted changes before continuing.
   - Verify no local commits are unpushed (git status / git log); push if any.
   - Rationale: a clean, committed working tree is required before repeatable verification runs and prevents ambiguity about what was tested.

2. Re-run the verification pipeline now that VC is clean
   - Run: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr
   - Capture the full console output (use tee) so results are recorded in .voder/history.md.
   - If the build still fails with TS5055 (overwrite errors), do one minimal fix and re-run (example: confirm tsconfig.exclude includes "dist", ensure dist is not in "include", and remove any tracked dist files from the index with git rm --cached -r dist/ if they remain tracked).

3. Add a focused unit test for PostCSS behavior (quick win for TESTING & FUNCTIONALITY)
   - Implement tests/tests/build/postcss.test.ts asserting:
     - createPostCSSConfig returns an object with plugins array
     - autoprefixer is included or the returned config includes expected structure/options
   - Run tests and confirm they pass; this proves functional behavior rather than just presence.
   - Rationale: raises testing from 10% by verifying actual functionality and starts satisfying test requirements.

4. Stop relying on committed compiled outputs
   - Ensure dist/ is listed in .gitignore and not tracked in the index:
     - If dist files are tracked, remove them from the index (git rm --cached -r dist/) and commit that change.
   - This avoids TS write/overwrite issues (TS5055) and ensures builds are done from source.

5. Add minimal consumer-facing docs (README.md) and a short API section
   - Create README.md that includes purpose, install, quick start (how to import createPostCSSConfig), scripts to run tests/build, and security/license blurb.
   - This addresses documentation gaps quickly and improves consumer experience.

6. Plan medium-term work (after immediate verification & unit test pass)
   - Implement remaining required modules incrementally (one vertical slice per commit):
     - src/build/vite-library.ts + tests
     - src/testing/* (vitest-jsdom, setup, helpers, accessibility) + tests
     - src/linting/* factories + tests
     - scripts to generate .markdownlint.json and add lint:md scripts
     - Add dual export paths in package.json and corresponding export-equivalence and installation integration tests
   - Each change should be small, committed independently, and validated by the verify pipeline.

Summary: Clean VC and re-run verification immediately. If the build fails due to TS artifacts, remove tracked dist and ensure tsconfig excludes dist. Add a minimal unit test for createPostCSSConfig and add README.md. After those fixes, proceed incrementally to implement the remaining modules and the comprehensive test suite. Once tests and verification are green, push and iterate further.

If you want, I can:
- produce the exact git and npm commands to run next (non-interactive),
- create the unit test file for createPostCSSConfig and the README.md as minimal patches,
- or run the verification loop (if you want me to perform the next code changes step-by-step).



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (25% ±10% COMPLETE)
- Implemented / present:
  - PostCSS configuration factory (createPostCSSConfig) implemented and exported from the package entry (src and compiled dist present).
  - Minimal public export barrel (src/index.ts) exposing createPostCSSConfig; matching compiled dist entry exists and smoke test imports it.
  - TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json) is present and set to emit declarations to dist; build/test/type-check scripts exist in package.json.
  - A guarded vite.config.ts exists to avoid optional-plugin startup failures (robustness).
  - Basic Vitest tests exist for package-structure and a smoke test that imports dist; compiled test artifacts are present under dist/tests/.
  - ADRs and package-local documentation for several design decisions are present in docs/decisions/.
  - package.json contains main/types/exports and peer/devDependency entries aligned with several ADRs.

- Partial / limited implementations:
  - Tests: there are basic smoke and package-structure tests, but the test surface is very small and focuses only on the compiled entry and exports presence (does not exercise PostCSS behavior or any UI testing utilities).
  - Packaging/exports: main export (".") to dist is implemented and validated by tests; however the fuller dual-export strategy (dedicated subpaths such as ./testing, ./prettier, ./eslint) described in the guide is not implemented.
  - Build pipeline: basic build/type-check/test scripts exist and have been run, though the earlier TS overwrite issue indicates the build setup required an adjustment; the core build for current implemented artifacts appears present.

- Missing / NOT implemented (major gaps relative to requirements):
  - Vite library configuration factory (createViteLibraryConfig) — referenced in the guide but not present in the repo source.
  - UI testing stack: Vitest jsdom configuration factory (createVitestJsdomConfig), test environment setup (setupJsdomTestEnvironment), DOM testing helpers (renderComponent, simulateClick, etc.), and accessibility utilities (expectAccessible, getAccessibilityViolations, etc.) are not implemented in src (only exist in the spec doc).
  - Linting configurations: html, css, and accessibility lint config factories are not present in src (spec provides them, but implementation files are absent).
  - Template files and example configs (templates/), and many of the outlined module files in src (build/vite-library.ts, testing/*, linting/*, utils/*) are missing.
  - Required package scripts from the universal guide are missing or incomplete: mandatory markdown lint scripts (lint:md, lint:md:fix), format/format:check, lint/lint:fix, and the canonical verify script are not present in package.json.
  - Markdown lint integration (generation of .markdownlint.json from @voder/dev-config) is not implemented / no script present.
  - Dual export strategy: dedicated export paths and equivalence tests are not implemented.
  - Integration/package-installation tests and export-equivalence tests (required for configuration packages) are missing.
  - Coverage and quality gates: no evidence of meeting the high coverage thresholds (90%+), and there are no tests that exercise the public API beyond the single-postcss export.
  - README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and many of the public-facing documentation items required by the guide are not present or not completed.
  - Many of the "Primary Responsibilities" (Vite library configs, CSS processing beyond the PostCSS factory, jsdom testing utilities, accessibility testing, HTML/CSS linting, component test utilities) are unimplemented beyond the PostCSS factory.

- Risk / completeness notes:
  - The repository has a clear and thorough specification; however the actual implemented surface is a small subset (primarily PostCSS factory + minimal packaging/test scaffolding). For a package intended to provide a full suite of UI tooling (build configs, testing factories, lint rules, utilities, templates, and a complete set of tests and scripts), the current implementation meets only the foundational starting point.
  - Tests and exports currently present validate only packaging and the presence of the single PostCSS API; they do not validate the broader functional promises made in the package guide.

Summary: The codebase implements an important core piece (PostCSS + autoprefixer factory) and minimal packaging/tests, but the majority of the package responsibilities and required features (Vite library factory, jsdom testing utilities, accessibility helpers, linting configs, templates, mandatory scripts, comprehensive tests, and dual export strategy) remain unimplemented. Overall functionality completion is low — roughly 25% of the targeted feature set is implemented.

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (65% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository currently contains a small, working surface: the compiled dist exports, a minimal source export barrel (src/index.ts), and Vitest smoke + package‑structure tests that exercise the compiled output. Those tests (which import dist/*) are consistent with the current state and — per your history — have passed previously. The TypeScript target (ES2022 / NodeNext) and the exported .js extension usage are aligned for ESM output, and the build/test scripts are present and reasonably formed.

  However there are several code‑quality gaps and risks that reduce the score:
  - Incomplete source surface: the source-level implementation for many advertised APIs (eg. src/build/postcss.ts, testing helpers, linting factories) is either missing from the tracked src tree or not visible in the current file list. The package currently relies on compiled artifacts in dist, which hides missing/unsynced source files and increases risk of drift. A source-first implementation is preferable.
  - Fragile build assumptions: some source files import with .js extensions (correct for ESM output), but if source files referenced by those imports are missing, type-check / runtime authoring workflows and some toolchains can break. The recent TS5055 overwrite issue you saw is symptomatic of build/output path confusion (dist tracked or referenced as inputs). The tsconfig exclusion fix was required — this indicates the build configuration and repo state need hardening.
  - Minimal test coverage: tests are currently smoke & structure checks against compiled output. There are no unit tests for core factories/utilities (PostCSS config, Vite factory, DOM helpers) in source form. The test surface is insufficient to meet the package's described guarantees.
  - No lint/format enforcement or configs present in the package root (eslint/prettier/markdown lint scripts & configs required by the guides are missing). That reduces maintainability and makes style/consistency ad hoc.
  - Missing documentation and README for consumers; docs exist in docs/ but README.md and other package metadata guidance are not present/incomplete relative to the spec.
  - Error handling and API documentation are sparse (the single source barrel has no JSDoc, public types are minimal).
  - Some dependencies (dev & peer) are present but the package doesn't yet demonstrate the expected dual-export patterns or full integration tests required by the guide.

  Summary: The code is in an intermediate but working state for the narrow, compiled-output-driven tests that exist today. It is not yet robust, well-tested at source level, or conformant with the broader repository standards (linting, docs, dual exports, complete source implementations). To raise quality toward 90–100% would require: restoring/adding missing source modules, adding unit tests for each public API, adding package-local lint/format configs and scripts, removing reliance on committed/visible dist as a crutch, and improving API docs and error handling.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (10% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- There are only two formal Vitest test files in the package source:
  - tests/package-structure.test.ts — validates that package.json exports point to files under ./dist and do not reference .ts sources.
  - tests/smoke.test.ts — smoke test that imports the compiled dist entry and asserts createPostCSSConfig exists and is a function.
- Compiled equivalents exist under dist/tests/*.js indicating prior successful builds and test runs; historical notes indicate these two tests passed previously after a successful build.
- Coverage: there is no coverage report checked here and the existing test surface is extremely small. The tests exercise only:
  - export path correctness (packaging surface)
  - a minimal smoke assertion that the compiled export exists
  They do NOT exercise functional behavior of createPostCSSConfig, PostCSS plugin composition, Vite config factory, testing helpers, linting config factories, accessibility helpers, or any error/edge cases.
- Missing required test categories per the project’s own Universal Testing Standards:
  - No unit tests for createPostCSSConfig or other config factories (build/postcss.ts is untested).
  - No export-equivalence tests (dual-export pattern) or package-installation integration tests to validate consumer experience.
  - No smoke tests covering broader API surface (only createPostCSSConfig is asserted).
  - No tests verifying version-alignment or dependency constraint behaviors (e.g., vitest / coverage provider).
- Coverage thresholds (project policy: ≥90% overall, 100% public API) are not met and cannot be met with current tests; current test set will produce extremely low coverage.
- Passing status: based on project history, the tests passed in a prior successful verification run; however the most recent verification run failed at build time (TS build errors) so tests could not be executed in that run. Assuming the build is fixed, the two tests should pass, but that does not imply adequate test coverage.

Summary judgement:
- Tests exist and are minimal / focused on packaging/smoke assertions — they are valuable as a starting point but insufficient.
- Many mandatory test categories and detailed unit/integration tests are missing; current coverage will be far below the project's required thresholds.

Recommendations (short):
- Add unit tests for createPostCSSConfig (behavioral assertions for autoprefixer plugin inclusion and options).
- Add tests for the Vite library config factory and linting config factories.
- Add export-equivalence and package-installation integration tests.
- Run coverage and incrementally expand tests until policy thresholds (90%+ / 100% public API) are met.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (70% ±10% COMPLETE)
- The package has been exercised successfully in the past: there is clear evidence that tsc (type-check), tsc -p (build) and Vitest tests completed successfully in an earlier full verification run — compiled outputs exist in dist/ and the smoke/package-structure tests target those compiled files.
- However, the most recently executed verification command (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) failed with TypeScript TS5055 errors (tsc attempted to overwrite files under dist/ that were treated as inputs). That run exited with code 1, so the current repository state is not fully validated end-to-end.
- A corrective change (adding "exclude": ["dist"] to tsconfig.json) was made in the working tree to address the overwrite problem, but there is no evidence the verification pipeline has been re-run and succeeded since that fix.
- Conclusion: build & test scripts are mostly implemented and have worked previously, but at present the verification pipeline is failing (build-stage) until the TS5055 issue is confirmed resolved by re-running the verification. Overall execution is partially successful but not fully validated.

<scratchpad>
Observations from repo:
- Strong: docs/decisions/ (many ADRs, good coverage), docs/libraries/usage (postcss + dev-config), prompts provide long implementation guides and API-like examples, tsdoc/JSDoc present in prompt examples, dist has compiled entry and d.ts for exported symbol createPostCSSConfig.
- Missing or incomplete: no package README.md at repo root or package root; no CHANGELOG.md; no concise API reference for exported functions/types (only examples in prompts and small dist type file with one export); no .markdownlint.json (generation referenced but not present); no SECURITY.md or explicit security posture in README; no user-facing docs for scripts (how to run verify/build/test) beyond package.json; no CONTRIBUTING.md; no examples directory or code samples shipped in repo (prompts contain examples but are internal).
- Quality: ADRs and decision docs are excellent and thorough. The implementation/usage guidance inside prompts/development-ui-tools.md is comprehensive but those files are in prompts/ (internal) rather than a published README. Consumers and humans visiting the package root (npm/GitHub) will miss essential public-facing docs.
- Impact: For maintainers/LLM agents the documentation is rich; for consumers and humans (README/API surface/usage) the package is missing the standard, expected docs that appear on package pages.

Estimate scoring rationale:
- ADRs and design docs: near complete → strong positive.
- User-facing README/API/CHANGELOG/SECURITY/usage examples at package root: missing → major negative.
- Tests and examples exist but not documented in a central README; package.json has scripts but no docs explaining them.

Decision: overall documentation completeness moderate but with critical gaps (README + API reference + CHANGELOG + security posture). Score ~55% with ±10% confidence.
</scratchpad>

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (55% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Strengths:
  - Thorough decision records (docs/decisions/) — ADRs are well‑written, date stamped, and cover architecture, dependency, and policy choices.
  - Developer-oriented reference material exists in prompts/development-ui-tools.md and prompts/universal-guide.md; these contain detailed API examples, configuration guides, test requirements, and usage snippets.
  - Library usage docs present for PostCSS and @voder/dev-config (docs/libraries/usage/).
  - Package metadata (package.json) and scripts are present and consistent with the documented workflows.

- Weaknesses / Missing items (high priority):
  - No README.md at package root (or top-level) that is public-facing, self-contained, and consumer-friendly. This is the single biggest gap — users visiting the repo or package registry will not find installation, quick start, API surface, or security posture.
  - No concise API reference documenting exported functions, types, and runtime behavior. The implementation guide and prompts include examples, but there is no dedicated API docs page or README section describing the public surface (e.g., createPostCSSConfig, PostCSSConfigOptions, createVitestJsdomConfig, testing helpers).
  - No CHANGELOG.md in repository to record notable changes/releases.
  - No SECURITY.md or equivalent security posture document (the README template mentions it, but it's not present).
  - Missing .markdownlint.json (generation is referenced but not present) and no docs explaining how to generate or run markdown linting beyond code snippets.
  - No CONTRIBUTING.md or short developer onboarding doc that summarises the verify/build/test workflow in one place for new contributors.
  - Public examples / cookbook (small runnable examples) are only in prompts or tests; they should be surfaced in README or docs for consumers.

- Medium/Lower priority gaps:
  - No explicit documentation of package exports (dual-exports pattern) in package README — prompts mention dual export strategy, but package.json currently has a single export; documentation should reflect actual exports and consumption examples.
  - No generated API docs from TypeScript (e.g., typed reference pages) — for a small package this may be optional but desirable for developer experience.
  - No CHANGELOG or release guidance for consumers despite licensing/publishing policy notes.

- Recommended next minimal documentation work (small, high-impact items):
  1. Add README.md at package root with:
     - Short purpose summary, compatibility, installation, quick start, minimal usage examples for main exports (importing createPostCSSConfig).
     - How to run the development commands (type-check, build, test, verify).
     - Security posture paragraph noting no runtime networking/telemetry, inputs processed, and update policy (as required by template).
     - Proprietary license notice.
  2. Add a short "API" section in README listing exported functions/types with one-line descriptions (createPostCSSConfig, PostCSSConfigOptions, and where to find more in src/ or prompts).
  3. Add CHANGELOG.md placeholder and SECURITY.md placeholder referencing the README security posture.
  4. Add a short CONTRIBUTING.md or a "Development" section in README that points to npm scripts (verify, build, test).
  5. Commit a small docs/ note or script README snippet describing how to generate .markdownlint.json (or include a generated file if policy requires).

- Overall assessment:
  - The repository contains excellent internal and architectural documentation (ADRs and implementation guides), which is why the score is above average. However, visible, consumer-ready documentation (README, API reference, changelog, security) is missing. Adding those few high-impact documents will move the repo from "developer-only" docs to a well-documented package ready for consumers and automated publishing.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (100% ± 0% COMPLETE)
- There are no runtime "dependencies" declared in package.json for @voder/ui-tools (the package.json contains only "peerDependencies" and "devDependencies"). Therefore there is nothing in the runtime dependency set to update or to report as vulnerable for this package specifically.
- Repository-wide audit summary (from your history) shows 0 reported vulnerabilities across the dependency surface, so no immediate security issues were detected.
- Notes / actionable points (non-blocking):
  - Although not runtime dependencies, the package does declare peerDependencies and devDependencies (vitest, postcss, autoprefixer, jest-axe, etc.). Those should be kept monitored and audited regularly because issues in devDependencies or peers can still affect build/test processes or produce confusing consumer warnings.
  - I noticed a metadata mismatch risk (peer vs dev) for jest-axe in the workspace history (peer/ dev versions differ). That is not a runtime dependency issue, but aligning peer metadata reduces consumer confusion and should be addressed separately if desired.
  - Continue periodic npm audit, keep lockfile refreshed, and update peer/dev deps as needed.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall posture: Good. The package is private, uses modern tooling, includes a lockfile, and the repo contains ADRs that mention supply-chain audits and registry mirroring. A recent audit run reported zero vulnerabilities. There are no obvious remote‑execution or open network interfaces in the codebase itself.

- Notable strengths
  - package.json sets "private": true and "license": "UNLICENSED", preventing accidental public publish.
  - package-lock.json is present (history says it was committed) so installs can be reproducible and audited.
  - A supply‑chain ADR and audit run exist; the project already ran npm audit (zero findings reported).
  - .gitignore prevents committing common output and sensitive temporary files.
  - Dev scripts and TypeScript build are local; there are no server or runtime network calls in source code.
  - Dynamic optional plugin loading in vite.config.ts is defensive (errors swallowed) rather than failing open in a dangerous way.

- Potential security issues / concerns
  1. Checked-in compiled artifacts (dist/)
     - Risk: The repo contains compiled output under dist/ (dist/src/index.js and .d.ts). Committed build artifacts increase the attack surface: they can mask source changes, may contain transpiled or inlined data, and make supply‑chain review harder. They also risk leaking build-time paths or debug info if source maps are included.
     - Recommendation: Ensure dist/ is not tracked (git rm --cached -r dist/), keep dist/ in .gitignore (already present), and rely on package-lock + build-from-source in CI. If dist/ must be visible to LLMs, prefer .voderignore negation rather than committing artifacts.

  2. Installer script execution (npm lifecycle scripts)
     - Risk: "prepare": "node ../../setup-package-docs.js" and other npm scripts run code at install-time (prepare runs on npm install). If contributors, CI, or downstream consumers run install in untrusted contexts, arbitrary JS can execute.
     - Recommendation: Keep install-time scripts minimal and well-reviewed. Document prepare behavior. In CI use npm ci and run verify in controlled environment. Consider limiting the set of lifecycle scripts that run automatically.

  3. Supply‑chain / transitive dependency risk
     - Risk: The package uses many devDependencies and peerDependencies (Vitest, vite, postcss, autoprefixer, markdownlint, jsdom, jest-axe, etc.). Transitive packages can introduce vulnerabilities even if top-level deps are clean.
     - Recommendation: Continue automated SCA (npm audit, dependabot or equivalent), validate lockfile integrity, pin or tightly constrain versions where ADRs recommend, and run supply‑chain checks in CI. Consider verifying checksums and registry mirrors per the ADR.

  4. Exec/child_process usage in docs/examples
     - Risk: Some testing/integration examples in the guides (and in future planned tests) use execSync/npm pack/execSync to run commands in temporary directories. If such code is added to tests and not properly sandboxed, there is potential for command‑injection if inputs are derived from untrusted content.
     - Recommendation: When using execSync in tests, ensure inputs are sanitized and tests run in isolated temp dirs. Prefer built-in Node APIs and avoid shell interpolation of untrusted strings.

  5. Node version / experimental flags
     - Risk: The project relies on Node >= 22.6.0 and use of experimental flags (e.g., --experimental-strip-types) for TypeScript config loading per ADR. Experimental features can change semantics and contain unresolved bugs.
     - Recommendation: Document required Node versions clearly. Run CI with pinned Node images matching the supported version. Re-evaluate experimental flag usage when Node stabilizes.

  6. Visibility of internal metadata (.voder)
     - Risk: The repo contains .voder metadata and history files that capture console outputs and implementation details (and are intentionally tracked). These may include sensitive context (command output, environment details). The .voder files are currently tracked and visible.
     - Recommendation: Review .voder/* contents for any secrets or sensitive environment dumps. Ensure no credentials or tokens are captured. If sensitive, move to secure storage or redact history.

- Best-practice recommendations (actionable)
  - Remove tracked build artifacts: git rm --cached -r dist/ and commit; rely on .gitignore to keep them out of VCS.
  - Maintain and commit the lockfile (already present). Run npm ci in CI and local verification to ensure deterministic installs.
  - Continue regular automated SCA (npm audit, SCA tool), and enforce it in CI per ADR.
  - Consider adding a lockfile integrity or verified registry check step in CI (e.g., audit-ci, npm ci with registry mirror validation).
  - Keep install-time scripts minimal; document what prepare does so maintainers understand what executes on install.
  - Review third‑party dev tooling versions (peerDependencies vs devDependencies) and pin where ADRs require exact alignment (e.g., vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8).
  - Sanitize and sandbox any future test code that will run shell commands or execute dynamic code.
  - Ensure CI runs with a minimal, up-to-date Node version consistent with ADR requirements to avoid relying on experimental behavior in uncontrolled environments.
  - Review repository for secrets (even though .gitignore excludes .env) and add pre-commit or CI scanning for accidental secrets.

- Conclusion
  - No immediate vulnerability is visible in the code itself (no network servers, no unsafe eval, no obvious path traversal or injection in committed source). The main residual risks are supply‑chain related (transitive dependencies), lifecycle script execution risk, and the presence of tracked build artifacts which complicate review and can hide changes. Those are addressable via the recommendations above.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, publishable state: there are local modifications that are not committed (working tree is dirty), so version control completeness is low.
- Specifics:
  - Uncommitted changes exist: "Changes not staged for commit" shows 7 modified files (.voder/history.md, .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md, .voder/progress-chart.png, .voder/progress-log-areas.csv, .voder/progress-log.csv). Because any uncommitted changes reduce completeness to at most 30%, this is the primary blocker.
  - No unpushed commits: the branch is reported "up to date with 'origin/main'" and branch info shows no ahead/behind—so there are no local commits pending push (this avoids the mid‑range penalty).
  - Untracked important files: git status reports 0 untracked files, but the file-tracking summary shows "Project files tracked: 22/28" (22 of 28) — indicating some project files are not tracked (6 not tracked). This reduces completeness further because missing tracked project files may indicate incomplete VCS coverage or intentionally ignored build outputs; it should be verified whether the untracked items are intentionally ignored or accidental.
  - Build artifacts appear correctly ignored by .gitignore (dist/, node_modules/, logs, etc.), which is good, but some metadata under .voder/ is modified and currently uncommitted — leaving important historical/operational state out of commits.
- Bottom line: The repository is only partially well-managed under version control. Synchronization with remote is fine (no unpushed commits), and ignore patterns look appropriate, but the presence of unstaged/modified files and the discrepancy in tracked project files prevents this repo from being considered clean or fully version-controlled. To reach a high completeness (>80%) you must commit or intentionally stash/clean the working changes and confirm that all required project files are tracked as intended.
