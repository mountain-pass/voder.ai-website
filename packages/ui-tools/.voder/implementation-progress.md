Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (49% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What’s complete
  - A focused vertical slice is implemented: createPostCSSConfig is implemented in src/build/postcss.ts and exported from src/index.ts; compiled artifacts exist in dist/ and basic Vitest smoke + package-structure tests are present and have passed in earlier runs. TypeScript configuration (NodeNext, strict, declarations) and a guarded vite.config.ts exist. Documentation (ADRs, internal guides) is thorough for implementers.
  - CODE_QUALITY and SECURITY are strong: TypeScript strict mode, defensive coding (vite dynamic import), and low immediate code-level security risk. DEPENDENCIES (tooling) are up-to-date and vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 are version-aligned.

- What’s missing / blocking
  - FUNCTIONALITY (35%): The package lacks most of the advertised surface from the @voder/ui-tools guide — the Vite library factory, testing/jsdom utilities, accessibility helpers, linting config factories, templates, shared utils, dual-export patterns, and many package scripts are not implemented.
  - TESTING (35%): Test surface is minimal. Required unit tests (e.g., createPostCSSConfig behavior), export-equivalence tests, package-installation integration tests, and broad coverage requirements (90% threshold, 100% public API coverage) are not implemented.
  - EXECUTION (70%): The build pipeline is unstable — recent verification failed during tsc emit because TypeScript attempted to overwrite dist/ inputs. tsc --noEmit passes, but full build + test verification is not reliably green.
  - DOCUMENTATION (60%): Strong internal ADRs and guides, but missing consumer-facing README.md, CHANGELOG.md, API reference, and generated markdownlint config or scripts required by the guide.
  - VERSION_CONTROL (20%): The repo is not in a clean state: there are unstaged/modified files (.voder/* metadata) and the branch is ahead of origin by 2 commits (unpushed commits). This prevents a clean, reproducible snapshot and should be resolved immediately.
  - DEPENDENCIES (85%) and SECURITY (85%) are generally good — npm audit previously reported zero vulnerabilities and required version alignment decisions were followed (vitest ↔ coverage provider). One packaging mismatch was noted (jest-axe peer vs dev version) and should be reconciled.

- Reference numbers (from sub-assessments)
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 35%
  - CODE_QUALITY: 85%
  - TESTING: 35%
  - EXECUTION: 70%
  - DOCUMENTATION: 60%
  - DEPENDENCIES: 85%
  - SECURITY: 85%
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 20%

## NEXT PRIORITY
The highest priority is to restore a clean, reproducible verification loop so further work can proceed safely. Based on the lowest scores (VERSION_CONTROL 20%, FUNCTIONALITY 35%, TESTING 35%), do the following, in order:

1) Restore version-control cleanliness (highest immediate priority)
   - Commit or stash the modified .voder/* metadata files (or include them in a focused commit), then push the local commits so main is synchronized with origin. A clean, pushed main branch is required before iterating on fixes or running verification in CI-like conditions.

2) Fix the build emit conflict and re-run the verification pipeline
   - Ensure tsconfig.json excludes dist (confirm "exclude": ["dist"] is present and saved).
   - Remove any stray dist/ files from the working tree so tsc can emit cleanly (e.g., ensure dist is not tracked and remove repo-local compiled artifacts).
   - Re-run the verification pipeline: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test (capture console output).
   - If the build still fails, follow the single-change loop: pick one focused corrective action (tsconfig exclude, add missing devDependency, or patch package.json exports), commit, push, and re-run verification.

3) Once build & tests are stable, expand tests and functionality incrementally
   - Add unit tests for createPostCSSConfig (verify autoprefixer plugin and browser targets and override behavior).
   - Implement the next required source modules one small step at a time (e.g., add src/build/vite-library.ts and tests for it), each change followed by the verification loop.
   - Implement missing standardized scripts (verify, lint:md, lint:md:fix, format, lint), README.md, and CHANGELOG.md.

Rationale: Version control hygiene + a working build/test pipeline are prerequisites. Fixing those will unlock safe, incremental work toward the many missing features and test coverage requirements.

If you want, I can produce the exact minimal sequence of non-interactive commands and the single focused patch to get the repo clean and the build green (for example: commit .voder changes and push, remove local dist files from the working tree, run the verification pipeline, and — if it fails — apply the targeted tsconfig exclude fix). Which step should I prepare for you to run next?



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (35% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Implemented / working
  - PostCSS configuration factory implemented (src/build/postcss.ts) and exported via public barrel (src/index.ts). Dist contains compiled JS and d.ts for this export.
  - Minimal package metadata in package.json: name, type: module, main/types/exports pointing to compiled dist entry (single export ".").
  - Core TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json) is present and emits declarations to dist/.
  - Basic Vitest smoke and package-structure tests exist (tests/smoke.test.ts, tests/package-structure.test.ts) that exercise the compiled dist entry and package exports.
  - Guarded vite.config.ts added to avoid optional-plugin failures.
  - Documentation/ADRs and usage docs exist and are thorough (many ADRs in docs/decisions/, usage docs under docs/libraries).

- Partially implemented / present but incomplete
  - Build output (dist/) is present and visible to LLM agents via .voderignore negation — useful for package inspection, but the repo history shows build/untrack complications (TS build conflicts with dist were addressed partially).
  - DevDependencies and peerDependencies are declared for many tools (vitest, postcss, autoprefixer, jsdom, jest-axe, etc.), but not all development scripts and tooling integrations required by the guides are wired up.

- Missing or NOT implemented (key gaps vs. the implementation guide & universal requirements)
  - Major package features from the @voder/ui-tools guide are absent:
    - Vite library configuration factory (src/build/vite-library.ts) is not present.
    - Testing utilities and configurations are missing: createVitestJsdomConfig, setup/test helpers, accessibility utilities, and test environment setup files are not implemented in src/testing/.
    - Linting configuration factories (createHTMLLintConfig, createCSSLintConfig, createAccessibilityLintConfig) are not implemented in src/linting/.
    - Templates directory (templates/*) is not present as described in the guide.
    - Shared utils (file-utils.ts, config-utils.ts) are not present.
  - Export surface is minimal (only createPostCSSConfig). The dual export strategy (main index + dedicated export paths like ./testing, ./prettier, ./eslint, ./typescript) required by the guide is not implemented.
  - Required standardized package scripts are missing or incomplete:
    - No mandatory "verify" script, no markdown lint scripts (lint:md / lint:md:fix), no format/lint scripts required by the universal guide.
  - Mandatory markdown-lint generation/setup script and .markdownlint.json are missing.
  - Many mandated tests are absent:
    - Export-equivalence tests, package-installation integration tests, export-integration tests, smoke test categories beyond the basic smoke test, and the broad coverage targets are not implemented.
    - Coverage and quality requirements (90%+ thresholds, 100% public API coverage) are not met.
  - README.md and CHANGELOG.md (public-facing, required content and security posture) are missing.
  - ESLint / Prettier config integration and the required eslint.config.js and prettier.config.js files are not present.
  - The package does not yet meet the "success criteria" in the universal guide (interface compliance, 100% public API coverage, mandatory docs/tests/scripts).

- Current verification/build/test reliability
  - The repository history documents prior successful verification runs but also a recent build failure due to TypeScript attempting to overwrite dist/ inputs (addressed by adding exclude: ["dist"] to tsconfig). Given remaining missing components and scripts, a full `npm run verify` (as prescribed) cannot be executed because the "verify" script is not defined and many required tests and scripts are not present.
  - The existing Vitest tests that do exist target only the minimal postcss export and package-structure/smoke checks; they are insufficient coverage of the package responsibilities.

- Conclusion / net assessment
  - The project has a correct, focused starting vertical slice: a well-done PostCSS factory, build outputs, TypeScript setup, docs/ADRs, and a couple of verification tests. This is a solid foundation.
  - However, the package is far from implementing the full feature set and mandatory QA/tooling required by the guides (testing utilities, linting, templates, standardized scripts, dual exports, comprehensive tests, README/CHANGELOG, and many other mandated pieces).
  - Functionality completeness is therefore low: the repository implements one core feature fully but lacks most of the advertised package responsibilities and required integration tests and scripts.

Score: 35% complete (±10%) — the single implemented vertical slice is correct and usable, but the majority of the package surface, tests, scripts, and integrations remain to be implemented.

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall the codebase appears functional and focused: compiled artifacts in dist/, a minimal public API (createPostCSSConfig) and a small test surface that imports the compiled entry. Past verification runs indicate tests have executed successfully, and TypeScript configuration is set up to produce declarations and ESM output. The TypeScript project settings (NodeNext module resolution, strict mode, declaration output) are appropriate for the ESM-first goals.

- Strengths
  - Clear, small, single-responsibility modules (public barrel exporting PostCSS factory).
  - TS config (NodeNext, strict) and build scripts are consistent with ESM output and explicit .js import extensions used in sources.
  - Tests are present that validate package structure and a smoke test that ensures compiled entry loads and exposes the expected API.
  - The guarded vite.config.ts shows defensive coding (dynamic optional plugin import) to avoid startup crashes when optional deps are missing.

- Issues and potential bugs
  - Minimal surface: The repository currently exposes only createPostCSSConfig in src/index.ts; more of the documented API (vite factory, testing utilities, lint configs) are present in compiled dist but not visible as source files in the provided listing — this makes source/test parity and maintenance harder. If source files are missing or out of sync with dist, future edits risk divergence.
  - Use of any: vite.config.ts uses many untyped any bindings. This is a minor type-safety gap and can hide runtime issues. Prefer explicit types or small helper types where feasible.
  - Import extensions in source (./build/postcss.js) are correct for ESM output but can be surprising in editor tooling; NodeNext+moduleResolution mitigates this, but it's a pattern that requires discipline and consistent tsconfig + tooling support.
  - Peer/dev dependency layout: Some required runtime modules (postcss/autoprefixer/jsdom/jest-axe) are declared as peer/dev deps in package.json in a way that could lead to runtime errors when consuming the package if consumers don't install expected peers — not a code bug per se, but a packaging/runtime risk.
  - Lack of linting/format files in the repo snapshot (no eslint.config.js / prettier.config.js present). The Universal guide requires those; absence means coding-style enforcement is not automated currently.
  - Tests target compiled dist (integration-style) — that's fine for export validation, but unit tests against source modules are missing in the visible source set. Relying only on compiled imports reduces quick-feedback unit testing during development.
  - Minor formatting/inconsistencies: source file shown (src/index.ts) has leading spaces and minimal comments; overall code is small so formatting issues are low-impact but adding Prettier/ESLint will standardize style.

- Recommendations to improve quality (small, focused):
  - Add a package-local ESLint and Prettier config (or import from @voder/dev-config) and a lint:fix script to enforce consistency.
  - Replace any usages (vite config) with tighter types or small helper functions to reduce hidden errors.
  - Ensure all documented source files (src/build/postcss.ts, src/testing/*, src/linting/*) are present in the repo source tree and kept in sync with dist to avoid maintenance drift.
  - Add a focused unit test for createPostCSSConfig (testing expected plugin list and options) to complement the smoke and structure tests.
  - Document peer dependency expectations in README and consider tests that assert required peer modules are present (or fail with a helpful message).

Summary: The code is largely correct and working for its minimal scope, with good TypeScript and build choices. The main quality gaps are maintainability and guardrails (missing linting/format configs, some any usage, and potential source/dist sync issues). Addressing those will raise confidence and robustness.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (35% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- There are formal Vitest suites in place for basic package validation: a smoke test that imports the compiled entry (tests/smoke.test.ts) and a package-structure test that validates package.json export paths (tests/package-structure.test.ts). An earlier recorded Vitest run succeeded (2 test files, 2 tests passed).
- However, the repository currently encountered a build failure in the most recent verification run (TypeScript tsc build errors writing into dist/), so the full verification pipeline could not complete at that time. Once that build issue is resolved, the existing tests should run — they have passed in prior runs.
- Test surface is very limited. Coverage and test categories mandated by the project (unit tests for configuration generators, DOM/testing helpers, lint config generators, export-equivalence, package-installation integration, and smoke/package-structure) are not implemented or are missing:
  - Missing unit tests for createPostCSSConfig behavior (no assertions on produced plugin config), Vite config factory, testing helpers, accessibility utilities, and lint config generators.
  - No export-equivalence tests, no package-installation integration tests, and no comprehensive integration/smoke suites that exercise the package beyond loading the compiled entry.
  - No evidence of coverage measurement or enforcement that would meet the project's stated thresholds (90%+ and 100% for public API).
- Given the limited test set (effectively two small tests) and the project's strict coverage requirements, current testing is far from adequate. My estimate: roughly 35% complete toward the required testing goals (uncertainty ±15% due to not re-running the pipeline after the recent build fix).
- Recommended next testing work (minimal, focused list):
  1. Fix the build issue so tests can be re-run reliably.
  2. Add unit tests for createPostCSSConfig that assert autoprefixer plugin and browser targets are included and can be overridden.
  3. Add tests for the Vitest jsdom factory and testing helpers (renderComponent, simulateClick, waitForAnimation).
  4. Add export-equivalence and package-installation integration tests to validate package.json exports and consumer experience.
  5. Enable coverage collection in test:ci and add coverage threshold check to ensure progress toward the 90%+ goal.

In summary: tests exist and have passed in a prior run, but test coverage and breadth are currently insufficient against the project's requirements. Fixing the build and expanding unit/integration tests are the next priorities.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (70% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The project is largely implemented and many runtime artifacts/tests exist (compiled files in dist/, Vitest tests in place, package scripts defined). Previously the verification pipeline (type-check, build, tests) succeeded in earlier runs, and individual pieces (tsc --noEmit, Vitest) have passed at times.
- However, the most recent full verification failed during the build step: tsc -p tsconfig.json produced TS5055 errors because TypeScript attempted to overwrite files under dist/ that are being treated as inputs (examples: dist/src/build/postcss.d.ts, dist/src/index.d.ts). As a result the "build" script does not reliably complete and the full verify pipeline is failing.
- tsc --noEmit still passes, which indicates source type-checking is ok, but the emit step is blocked by the dist/input conflict. A change was made to add "exclude": ["dist"] to tsconfig.json, but the last verification attempt still failed (so the problem is not yet resolved or additional state remains).
- Conclusion: The software is partially runnable (many unit tests and compiled outputs exist), but the current build pipeline is not reliably working and the full verification (build + tests) is not green. Therefore execution/validation is not yet complete.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (60% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Strengths:
  - Extensive architecture/decision documentation: ADRs in docs/decisions cover local and inherited policy decisions (good coverage of design rationale and governance).
  - Technical guides present (prompts/): both the Universal Development Guide and the development-ui-tools guide are very detailed and cover architecture, APIs, testing, build, and quality expectations—excellent internal reference material.
  - Usage-oriented docs available: docs/libraries/ contains helpful context for PostCSS and @voder/dev-config, and the prompts include usage examples for Vite, Vitest, and component testing.
  - Tests and examples in the repo serve as executable documentation for expected behavior (smoke and package-structure tests demonstrate package contract).

- Gaps / Issues to address:
  - No package README.md at repository root (or in package root): there is no public-facing, consumer-oriented README that is self-contained and suitable for publishing (required by the policy). README.md is mandatory and must be written so it doesn't reference internal-only files.
  - Missing API reference / developer docs for public exports: the actual public API (createPostCSSConfig, types, and other planned exports) lacks a dedicated API doc (e.g., docs/api or README sections describing exported functions, parameter types, return shapes). Current information lives only in prompts and inline examples rather than a published API surface.
  - No CHANGELOG.md or release notes in repo (the template exists in prompts but not filled). Consumers expect a CHANGELOG for package changes.
  - No generated markdown-lint config file or documentation on how to generate it for this package (the policy requires integration with @voder/dev-config). While the guide describes generation, there is no shipped .markdownlint.json or a script to create it in place.
  - Missing consumer-focused quickstart / installation instructions localized to @voder/ui-tools (there are examples in prompts but no package README with install/usage snippets that would appear on npm/GitHub).
  - No API-level examples or docs for testing utilities, lint configs, and templates in a publishable place (templates/ exists in guide only; the repository lacks a populated templates/ directory or docs that reference stable template files).
  - Documentation scattered across prompts/ and docs/ — prompts/ are internal guidance (excellent for implementers/LLMs) but not appropriate for published consumer docs; consolidation and extraction are needed.
  - No CHANGELOG and no README security posture section (policy requires security posture content in README).

- Recommendations (prioritized):
  1. Add a public README.md in package root following the mandated template: purpose, compatibility, installation, quick-start examples (importing from the package), API summary, security posture, license (UNLICENSED), and contribution/verify instructions. Ensure it is self-contained and does not link to internal prompts/ files.
  2. Create an API reference (docs/api.md or docs/reference/) describing exported functions, types, parameters, and examples for createPostCSSConfig and other public APIs. Populate with short examples drawn from prompts/development-ui-tools.md.
  3. Add CHANGELOG.md (use the provided template) and an initial entry for v1.0.0.
  4. Provide a small docs/usage or templates/ folder with concrete example config files (vitest.config.ts, vite.config.ts, test-setup.jsdom.ts) referenced by README so consumers can copy-paste.
  5. Add a script or instruction to generate .markdownlint.json via @voder/dev-config and document its usage in README and package.json scripts (lint:md / lint:md:fix).
  6. Consolidate implementer-focused material: keep prompts/ for internal LLM/dev guidance, but ensure all consumer-facing content (README, docs/) is self-contained and accessible without referring to internal prompts.
  7. Add a short security posture section to README describing scope, data handling, and update policy.

- Overall: documentation is strong on internal policy, architecture, and developer guidance (prompt-driven materials and ADRs), but incomplete for external/consumer-facing documentation and API reference. Completing the README, API docs, changelog, and concrete usage templates will move this to a high-quality, publishable documentation state.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (≈85% ±10% COMPLETE)
- Summary: Based on the package.json and the recorded repository audit run, the dependency set appears current and well-aligned for the package's needs, and the prior npm audit reported zero vulnerabilities. Key dev tools (TypeScript 5.9.2, Vitest 3.2.4, @vitest/coverage-v8 3.2.4) are recent and version‑aligned where required (vitest ↔ @vitest/coverage‑v8). CSS tooling (postcss@^8, autoprefixer@^10) and testing/browser libs (jsdom@^26, @testing-library/*, jest-axe) are modern versions. No immediate, significant security issues are indicated by the available information.
- Positive points
  - Recent major/minor versions for core tooling (typescript, vitest, jsdom, autoprefixer).
  - Vitest and its V8 coverage provider are version-aligned (both 3.2.x) as mandated by ADR.
  - A recorded npm audit run reported 0 vulnerabilities (per history).
  - PeerDependencies are declared for consumer-facing tools (encourages consumer awareness).
- Issues / compatibility notes
  - Peer version mismatch: package.json lists jest-axe as a peerDependency "^9.0.0" but devDependency has jest-axe "^10.0.0". This is a potential consumer-facing mismatch and should be reconciled (ADR or bump peer to ^10) to avoid confusing peer warnings or runtime differences.
  - package.json declares vite as a peerDependency (^6.0.0) but does not include vite in devDependencies; if local build/test workflows or templates rely on vite during dev, consider adding vite as a devDependency (or keep it only as peer if consumers provide it).
  - Transitive dependency risks cannot be fully assessed from package.json alone — the lockfile (package-lock.json) and periodic npm audit are required to detect transitive vulnerabilities.
- Recommendations (actionable, single-step)
  - Align the jest-axe peerDependency to the dev version (e.g., set peerDependencies.jest-axe = "^10.0.0") and commit the paired ADR as planned — this fixes the only notable mismatch.
  - Continue running npm audit and keep the lockfile committed; re-run audits after dependency updates.
  - Before publishing changes, run a fresh npm audit + npm ci + npm run test:ci to confirm no introduced transitive vulnerabilities.
- Confidence / completeness: ~85% — assessment is accurate given package.json, devDependency list, and the reported npm audit result; however, a full verification requires checking the lockfile, running a fresh npm audit, and scanning transitive dependencies (±10% uncertainty).

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall verdict: Low immediate code-level security risk in the committed source. The codebase contains mostly configuration factories, pure helpers, and tests; there are no network calls, credential storage, or obvious unsafe file-system writes in runtime code. No high-risk patterns (eval, new Function, direct exec of untrusted input) are present in src/ or in the test files shown.

- Supply-chain / dependency risk (primary concern)
  - The package depends on a number of tooling libraries (autoprefixer, postcss, vitest, jsdom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2, etc.) that are currently declared as peer/dev dependencies. Any vulnerability in those third‑party packages affects the project during development/CI. Historical notes indicate an npm audit run reported zero vulnerabilities, but this should be considered transient.
  - Recommendation: enforce regular automated supply-chain scans (npm audit / SCA), pin or lock critical dev tooling where required by ADRs, and run dependency integrity checks in CI. The repository already contains ADRs addressing audit and registry-mirror policy — ensure those are enacted in CI.

- Execution of third-party modules / plugin loading
  - vite.config.ts dynamically imports an optional plugin ('vite-plugin-inline-source') and then executes it if available. Dynamic import of third-party modules is functional but executes the module's top-level code. This is acceptable for local dev but increases attack surface if untrusted dependencies are installed or if a malicious package is introduced.
  - Recommendation: keep plugin inputs trusted (only install vetted plugins), consider validating plugin identity/version, and run CI supply-chain verification to catch unexpected packages.

- Scripts that run arbitrary tooling
  - package.json contains scripts that run tooling (prepare, build, test, etc.). Some example test snippets in the documentation use child_process.execSync to run npm pack / npm install — if such tests are added/activated they will execute package lifecycle scripts (preinstall, install) in the tarball under test. Running package installation in tests is useful for packaging checks but has risk if the package under test or its dependencies include malicious install scripts.
  - Recommendation: if you add package-installation integration tests, sandbox them (use temporary dirs, minimal env), and avoid running untrusted package lifecycle scripts where possible; prefer npm ci with --ignore-scripts if safe for the test scenario, or explicitly control environment variables.

- File-system & repository hygiene
  - Project follows console-first policy; repository has .gitignore entries to prevent logs and temporary files. However dist/ currently appears present in the working tree (and was previously tracked) — accidental committing of build outputs can leak compiled artifacts or secrets and complicate audits.
  - Recommendation: ensure dist/ is not tracked in git (git rm --cached -r dist if needed) and CI builds from source. Continue to ensure .gitignore covers all temporary/output files. Keep any temporary runtime data written to OS temp only.

- Input validation & configuration safety
  - Factories (createPostCSSConfig, createViteLibraryConfig) accept plugin lists and configuration objects. If any of these options come from untrusted sources, they could enable execution of unexpected code via plugins.
  - Recommendation: document that these factory inputs must be constructed by codeowners or consumers; validate or sanitize file path inputs and prefer plugin references (names) with explicit install steps rather than allowing arbitrary objects from untrusted sources.

- Tests & test environment mocks
  - jsdom and jest-axe are used in testing utilities. Tests mock global browser APIs (matchMedia, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver) — these mocks look safe. However tests that spawn child processes or install packages (examples in docs) should be treated carefully (see earlier note).
  - Recommendation: maintain test isolation, cleanup (which is already present in setup.ts), and avoid shipping tests that require network access or external registries unless sandboxed.

- Secrets & sensitive data
  - I see no committed .env files or credentials. .gitignore includes .env. Continue to scan the repo for accidental secrets (use git secrets / truffleHog in CI).

- Privilege & publish controls
  - package.json is "private": true and license UNLICENSED, reducing risk of accidental public publish. Also ADRs prohibit npm publish from developers. Maintain these safeguards and CI gating.

- Recommended immediate actions (small, concrete)
  1. Add automated SCA in CI if not already present; run npm audit in CI and fail on high/critical.
  2. Ensure dist/ is not tracked in git and that the repository contains no committed build artifacts.
  3. When enabling package-installation tests, run them in an isolated sandbox and consider using --ignore-scripts or a controlled environment to avoid running arbitrary lifecycle scripts.
  4. Periodically pin or lock dev tooling where ADRs require exact-version alignment (the repo already has ADRs addressing vitest coverage alignment).
  5. Add a periodic secret-scan job to CI to catch accidental credential commits.

- Residual uncertainties (why estimate is ~85% complete)
  - I reviewed the top-level source, tests, packaging, and docs present in the working tree, but not the full transitive dependency tree or CI configuration (bespoke CI is external), nor runtime behaviour on various developer machines. I have not executed build/test commands to observe runtime behavior or dynamic resolution of optional modules. Those would surface additional issues (e.g., dependency vulnerabilities, install-time scripts). Addressing those would raise confidence toward 100%.

Summary: no immediate code-level critical vulnerabilities detected in the visible source. The dominant risk is supply-chain and arbitrary code execution from third-party dev tooling/plugins; mitigate by SCA, dependency pinning where required, sandboxing tests that install packages, and strict repository hygiene.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (20% ±10% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, fully-synchronized state. You currently have both uncommitted changes and local commits that have not been pushed, so the repo fails the two most important checks for a publishable/synchronized working tree.
- Specifics:
  - Uncommitted modifications: 7 modified files shown by `git status` (multiple .voder/* metadata files). Because there are unstaged/modified files present, this alone limits completeness to at most ~30%.
  - Unpushed commits: branch "main" is ahead of origin/main by 2 commits. Unpushed commits further limit completeness (max ~50% if that were the only problem). Combined with uncommitted changes, the practical completeness drops further.
  - File tracking / ignores: No untracked files were reported (untracked = 0). The .gitignore correctly excludes build outputs such as dist/, and .voderignore intentionally exposes !dist/ for LLM visibility — that pattern is acceptable. However the file-tracking summary shows "Project files tracked: 22/28", which suggests some expected project files may not be tracked; this should be verified. The earlier failed attempt to git rm --cached dist/ indicates care was taken to untrack build artifacts (good), but confirm that no source files were accidentally ignored or removed.
- Conclusion: Because there are outstanding local modifications and local commits not pushed, the repo is not fully under version control best-practices. Address the uncommitted changes (commit or stash), then push the local commits to origin to reach a clean, synchronized state. Only after those steps can the repository be considered >80% complete for version-control readiness.
