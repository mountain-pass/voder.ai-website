Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 59.9

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (48% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What’s complete
  - A focused vertical slice is implemented: PostCSS factory (src/build/postcss.ts) and a minimal public export (src/index.ts) are present and appear correct. This small implementation is low-risk and likely to work. (CODE_QUALITY: 75%, FUNCTIONALITY: 25%)
  - Tooling is declared in package.json (TypeScript, Vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, jsdom, autoprefixer, markdownlint-cli2, etc.), aligned with ADRs in docs/decisions. (DEPENDENCIES: 75%)
  - Project structure and TypeScript config are present and mostly sane for ESM output. (EXECUTION: 60%)

- What’s missing / incomplete
  - Core feature set from the implementation guide is mostly unimplemented: createViteLibraryConfig, testing utilities (vitest-jsdom, helpers, accessibility, setup), linting factories, templates, dual-export packaging and dist exports, and the verify pipeline are not implemented. The package only implements the PostCSS factory; the rest of documented responsibilities are absent. (FUNCTIONALITY: 25%)
  - Tests are extremely sparse: one unit test exists (PostCSS), but the comprehensive test matrix required by policy (smoke, package-structure, export-equivalence, package-installation integration, jsdom accessibility tests, version-alignment tests) is not present. Coverage is therefore far below policy thresholds. (TESTING: 10%)
  - Documentation is incomplete for consumers: no package README, no CHANGELOG, no public API docs; much of the guidance currently lives in prompts/ and ADRs rather than a public README. (DOCUMENTATION: 45%)
  - Some dependency/version mismatches exist (notably jest-axe: peer ^9.0.0 vs dev ^10.0.0) that can cause runtime/test failures—needs reconciliation and possibly an ADR. (DEPENDENCIES: 75% but with caveat)
  - Security posture: no immediate source-code issues, but supply-chain and install-time script risks exist (prepare script calling ../../setup-package-docs.js); supply-chain auditing must be run. (SECURITY: 70%)
  - Version control not clean/synchronized: uncommitted modifications exist (.voder/* files) and the branch is ahead of origin by 2 commits (unpushed). This prevents a publishable, reproducible state. (VERSION_CONTROL: 25%)

- Reference sub-assessment findings
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 25% — only PostCSS factory implemented; most package responsibilities absent.
  - CODE_QUALITY: 75% — implemented code is small, straight-forward, and likely correct; tooling/config inconsistencies remain.
  - TESTING: 10% — inadequate test surface; coverage targets not met.
  - EXECUTION: 60% — project wired for build & test but end-to-end execution unverified; possible dependency mismatch risk.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 45% — ADRs present but consumer-facing README and changelog missing.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 75% — generally modern and ADR-aligned; notable jest-axe mismatch to resolve and need to run npm audit.
  - SECURITY: 70% — no obvious source-code vulnerabilities, but supply-chain and install scripts need auditing.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 25% — uncommitted changes and unpushed commits block a clean state.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Based on the lowest-scoring areas (TESTING: 10% and VERSION_CONTROL: 25%) and the incremental, risk-minimizing approach in the Universal Guide, the immediate top priority is:

1) Restore a clean, synchronized repository (VERSION_CONTROL) — small, safe steps
   - Stage and commit current tracked modifications (the .voder metadata edits are tracked and must be committed) so the working tree is clean and local commits can be pushed.
     - Recommended commands (POSIX, non-interactive):
       - git add -A
       - git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): persist local .voder metadata changes"
       - git push origin main
   - Rationale: a clean working tree and pushed commits are prerequisites for reproducible verification, CI, and collaboration; they unblock subsequent verification steps and guarantee console history capture.

2) Run supply-chain checks and capture output to console
   - Run (console-first) checks so .voder/history.md records results:
     - npm audit --json --no-fund || true
     - npm outdated --json --no-fund || true
   - Rationale: identify high/critical vulnerabilities early and confirm dependency freshness before running full verification.

3) Reconcile the jest-axe version mismatch if it matters to tests
   - Inspect current peer vs dev versions:
     - node -e "const p=require('./package.json'); console.log('peer jest-axe:', p.peerDependencies?.['jest-axe']||'none'); console.log('dev jest-axe:', p.devDependencies?.['jest-axe']||'none');"
   - If there is a major-version mismatch and tests fail because of it, decide one narrow remediation:
     - Either align devDependency to the peer range (npm install --no-audit --no-fund --save-dev jest-axe@^9.0.0) or update peerDependencies (and author ADR) if upgrading is intended.
   - Rationale: keep test tooling compatible and avoid spurious failures.

4) Run the verification sequence and capture failures (TESTING / EXECUTION)
   - npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test
   - If failures occur, fix only small focused issues restricted to src/, tests/, or tsconfig.json; commit each focused fix and re-run verification. Iterate until verification is green.
   - Rationale: incremental fixes keep changes small and verifiable; this directly improves TESTING and FUNCTIONALITY scores.

Why this ordering?
- Version control must be cleaned first to ensure that all subsequent console output and CI/bisecting reflect a known committed state.
- Supply-chain checks and dependency alignment prevent wasting time debugging failures caused by dependency mismatches.
- Running verification early exposes concrete failures to address in small, test-driven changes; this is the fastest path to elevate low-scoring TESTING and FUNCTIONALITY areas.

If you want, I can produce the exact commands and the minimal patch plan to:
- Commit and push .voder changes,
- Run the audit/outdated and the node inspection for jest-axe,
- Run the verification sequence and parse results,
and then propose the smallest focused code/test fixes to get the suite green.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (25% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Implemented features (what works / present)
  - PostCSS factory implemented (src/build/postcss.ts) with autoprefixer and sensible defaults.
  - Public export barrel includes the PostCSS factory (src/index.ts exports createPostCSSConfig and its types).
  - TypeScript project configuration exists (tsconfig.json) and is set to emit declarations to dist/.
  - Basic npm scripts for type-check, build, and Vitest test runner are present in package.json.
  - Dev dependencies required for local development/testing (typescript, vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe, postcss, autoprefixer, markdownlint-cli2, etc.) are recorded in package.json.
  - A unit test for the PostCSS factory was added (tests/build/postcss.test.ts) and committed (force‑added due to .gitignore conflict).

- Missing / incomplete features (what's not implemented or not conformant)
  - Vite library configuration factory (createViteLibraryConfig / src/build/vite-library.ts) is not present.
  - UI testing stack is not implemented: no vitest-jsdom factory, no testing helpers, no accessibility helpers, and no test environment setup source files.
  - Linting configuration factories (src/linting/html.ts, css.ts, accessibility.ts) are absent.
  - Templates directory (templates/vitest.config.ts, vite.config.ts, test-setup.jsdom.ts) is missing.
  - The package export surface mandated by the guide (dual export strategy, exports to dist/) is not implemented in package.json (exports pointing to ./dist/* are not present).
  - Required scripts from the Universal Guide are missing (verify, lint, lint:fix, lint:md, lint:md:fix, format, format:check, copy:assets, clean per guide). The package.json has only a subset.
  - Comprehensive test suites are missing:
    - No export-equivalence tests, no package-structure tests, no package-installation integration tests, no smoke tests, and no tests validating vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 alignment.
    - Coverage requirements and policy-driven tests (≥90% and 100% public API coverage) are not met.
  - Markdown lint integration and generation helper (using @voder/dev-config) is not present.
  - README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and many documentation artifacts required by the package template are missing.
  - Packaging and dist-oriented post-build copying and scripts (copy:assets, prebuild/postbuild) and package.json exports pointing to dist/ are not implemented.
  - Many of the security/validation tests and dependency-alignment verification tests required by ADRs are not implemented.
  - The "verify" pipeline mandated by the Universal Guide is not available; therefore the single-command quality gate does not exist.

- Overall assessment
  - The repository currently contains a correct, focused implementation of the PostCSS configuration factory and exposes it via the package barrel; this is a validated vertical slice (source, export, unit test, toolchain entries).
  - However the vast majority of the package responsibilities described in the implementation guide (Vite library factory, testing utilities, accessibility helpers, linting factories, templates, export and packaging strategy, verification scripts, and required test coverage/integration tests) are not implemented yet.
  - Functionality coverage is therefore low: core foundation for one subfeature exists, but the package is far from delivering the full set of requested features and policy-driven requirements.

- Recommendation (brief)
  - Continue with the plan's incremental approach: implement createViteLibraryConfig next (small vertical slice) along with its unit tests, then add testing utilities and linting factories, iterating and verifying after each small change.

<scratchpad>
- Inventory: Key source files present: src/build/postcss.ts (implemented earlier), src/index.ts (exports createPostCSSConfig), tsconfig.json, tests include at least postcss.test.ts (force-added). package.json scripts present.
- Positive signals:
  - TypeScript strict mode enabled, declarations generated, outDir configured.
  - Exports use explicit .js extension in src/index.ts (matches ESM output guidance).
  - PostCSS factory implementation follows described API (autoprefixer, overrideBrowserslist).
  - Small, focused code surface reduces bug surface area.
- Potential code-quality concerns:
  - src/index.ts starts with a leading space before comment and export — purely stylistic but slightly inconsistent.
  - No repository-local ESLint/Prettier config checked into package (docs/decisions require them, but not necessary strictly for code correctness).
  - tsconfig includes "prettier.config.ts" in "include" but the file doesn't exist in repo — harmless at compile time (TS will just not find it), but could confuse editors or CI expecting the file.
  - package.json contains dev vs peer dependency version mismatches (jest-axe peer ^9.0.0 vs dev ^10.0.0; autoprefixer in both peer and dev) — this is not a runtime code bug but does affect reproducible dev environment and can surface as test failures. The user asked to focus on CODE QUALITY only, but this may influence tests/builds.
  - Tests were added and force-committed despite .gitignore; that indicates test files are present but potential repository policy mismatch (not strictly a code bug).
  - Many intended modules described in the design doc (vite, testing helpers, linting factories, templates, etc.) are not implemented yet — acceptable for incremental work but means public API is minimal.
- Likely runtime behavior:
  - createPostCSSConfig should return a simple object whose plugins array contains an autoprefixer invocation — that is straightforward and unlikely to fail normally.
  - With esModuleInterop + TypeScript settings, importing autoprefixer as default should work in a typical setup.
  - Overall low complexity => low likelihood of logic bugs in the implemented code.
- Style/standards:
  - Minor formatting inconsistencies; no explicit linting enforcement files to validate style.
  - Exports pattern aligns with the Universal Guide recommendation (explicit .js in source).
- Verdict bounds: code is small and likely correct; surrounding infra (dependencies, test/lint configs) has issues that could cause verification failures even if code is fine.
</scratchpad>

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (75% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The implemented code surface is small and straightforward (PostCSS factory + public export), and there are no obvious functional bugs in the TypeScript sources. TypeScript strict mode and declaration generation are enabled, imports/exports follow the ESM patterns required by the project, and the PostCSS factory uses autoprefixer correctly. However, there are several quality concerns to fix before declaring the package "clean":
  - Minor stylistic inconsistency in src/index.ts (leading whitespace / comment formatting).
  - tsconfig references prettier.config.ts in "include" but that file is not present — could cause tooling/editor confusion.
  - No local ESLint/Prettier config files are committed to enforce style; formatting/linting is not verifiable in CI without them.
  - Dependency-version mismatches in package.json (notably jest-axe peer vs dev ranges and duplicate autoprefixer entries) risk test/build instability even though source code is correct.
  - Many planned modules (vite factory, testing helpers, linting configs) are not yet implemented, so API coverage is incomplete (intentional incremental state).
  - A test was force-added despite .gitignore rules — tests exist but repository policy mismatch should be resolved.
- Overall: code correctness is good for the implemented pieces with low bug risk, but repository-level and tooling inconsistencies (dependency alignment and missing config files) reduce overall code quality until addressed.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (10% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Current test surface is minimal and incomplete. The repo contains a single focused unit test (PostCSS factory test) that was force-added; there are no other unit/integration/smoke/export-structure/package-installation tests required by the package policy. No test run output was provided, so pass/fail status is unknown — you must run the test suite (npm test) to confirm the existing test's result. Coverage is almost certainly far below the stated policy targets (90% overall, 100% public API), because only one small test exists.
  - What exists:
    - One unit test for createPostCSSConfig (tests/build/postcss.test.ts).
    - Vitest + V8 coverage devDependencies and scripts are present in package.json (so test tooling is installed/configured).
  - What is missing (required by the guides/ADRs):
    - Export-equivalence tests and package-export integration tests.
    - Package-structure tests verifying package.json exports → dist/ files.
    - Smoke tests that import the package and assert basic API shape.
    - Package-installation integration tests (packing and installing into a temp consumer).
    - Tests for Vite library factory, jsdom testing helpers, accessibility utilities (jest-axe), linting config factories, and template validation.
    - Automated tests that assert version-alignment constraints (vitest / @vitest/coverage-v8) per ADR.
    - Coverage thresholds and CI-style test:ci verification to ensure provider loads and coverage is produced.
  - Immediate risks / observations:
    - Because only one test exists, overall test coverage is effectively negligible and does not meet the documented policy.
    - The single test was force-added despite .gitignore — this suggests test placement and .gitignore rules should be reviewed to avoid accidental omissions in the future.
    - No test outputs were captured here; run npm run test and npm run test:ci to produce console output (captured into .voder/history.md) and to see failing areas.
  - Recommended next steps (minimal, prioritized):
    1. Run test suite and capture console output: npm run test (then npm run test:ci). Inspect failures and coverage report.
    2. Add mandatory package-structure.test.ts to validate package.json exports (even if exports are not yet in package.json).
    3. Add smoke tests that import the package (tests/smoke.test.ts).
    4. Implement and test createViteLibraryConfig and its tests (tests/build/vite-library.test.ts).
    5. Add jsdom-based tests for testing helpers and accessibility utilities (tests/testing/*.test.ts), including a test that imports jest-axe to verify compatibility with peer range.
    6. Add package-installation integration test (tests/package-installation.test.ts) per the guide.
    7. Iteratively expand tests to exercise every exported API until coverage targets are met; enforce coverage thresholds in Vitest config.
- Bottom line: Testing is in an early scaffold state (~10% complete). Significant work is required to implement the comprehensive test matrix mandated by the project's Universal Guide and package-specific implementation guide; until more tests are added and the suite is executed, pass/fail and coverage status remain unknown.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (60% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains the expected build & test scripts (type-check: tsc, build: tsc -p tsconfig.json, test: vitest run) and the TypeScript configuration looks reasonable for ESM output (target ES2022, module NodeNext, declaration generation to dist/). Dev tooling (vitest, ts, postcss, autoprefixer, jsdom, jest-axe, @vitest/coverage-v8, etc.) is recorded in package.json/devDependencies which indicates the environment was provisioned for running builds and tests.
- There is evidence of work to add a unit test for PostCSS and of successful non-interactive npm installs in the history, but there is no console output captured in the repository that shows a successful run of the verification sequence (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test). I do not see any explicit build/test run results indicating green status.
- A notable risk that may prevent successful test runs: a peer/dev dependency version mismatch exists for jest-axe (peerDependencies require ^9.0.0 while devDependencies list ^10.0.0). That kind of major-version mismatch commonly causes test failures or runtime "Cannot find module" / incompatible API issues with jest-axe and accessibility helpers.
- The source export pattern (src/index.ts exporting from './build/postcss.js') is consistent with ESM output conventions (TypeScript using .js specifiers), so the build should produce correct dist artifacts if tsc runs correctly. However, absence of an executed build/test log means this is unverified.
- Conclusion: the repository appears mostly wired up and provisioned for build & test, but execution has not been validated end-to-end. Expect to run the verification commands (type-check → build → tests) and likely address the jest-axe alignment (or run-time mismatches) before the package can be considered successfully executed and validated.

<scratchpad>
- Review repository files: docs/decisions/* are present (good ADR coverage). docs/libraries/usage/voder-dev-config.md exists but it's for @voder/dev-config, not @voder/ui-tools specifically.
- There is no package README.md in repo root or packages/ui-tools/README.md. Universal guide mandates a self-contained README for each package and a security posture section.
- No CHANGELOG.md present.
- API surface: src/index.ts only exposes createPostCSSConfig; there is minimal JSDoc in postcss.ts earlier (per history) but no generated API docs or in-repo API reference.
- Tests and prompts include usage examples, but those live in prompts/ and tests, not in user-facing README/docs.
- Markdown lint requirements exist; no .markdownlint.json in repo (expected to be generated from @voder/dev-config). package.json scripts do not include lint:md / lint:md:fix (prompts show scripts are mandatory). package.json currently lacks those mandatory scripts.
- ADRs for dependencies, prettier config, vitest, markdownlint are present — good decision documentation.
- Package-level usage documentation for ui-tools (how to use createViteLibraryConfig, createVitestJsdomConfig, helpers) exists in the prompts/development-ui-tools.md content, but that file is under prompts/ (internal) not a public README or docs path. docs/libraries/usage contains a doc for dev-config only.
- Summary: Strong internal decision documentation (ADRs) and rich implementation guidance in prompts, but missing the public-facing, package-scoped README, CHANGELOG, markdown-lint configuration and package-level usage docs and scripts. API reference is minimal/absent.

Estimate percent complete: probably around 40–50% documentation completeness. I'll choose 45% ±10%.
  
Key missing items to reach "adequate" coverage:
- package README.md (self-contained, installation, quickstart, examples, security posture, license) — required by policy.
- README must not reference internal files; move examples from prompts/development-ui-tools.md into README.
- API reference or at least an "Exports and example usage" section for ui-tools (describe createPostCSSConfig, createViteLibraryConfig, testing helpers, accessibility helpers).
- CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog template).
- .markdownlint.json generation script and mandatory package.json scripts: "lint:md" and "lint:md:fix".
- Docs/libraries/usage entry for @voder/ui-tools (similar to dev-config doc).
- Package-level ADR summary is good but may need an ADR for any dependency changes if made.
- Add examples for testing setup and Vite usage in README.
- Ensure README includes Security posture section per universal guide.

Prioritized next steps (small incremental changes):
1. Create packages/ui-tools/README.md (self-contained) with quickstart, install, usage examples (Vite, Vitest jsdom, PostCSS), API list, security posture, UNLICENSED notice.
2. Add docs/libraries/usage/voder-ui-tools.md or move/sync core parts of prompts/development-ui-tools.md into README and docs.
3. Add CHANGELOG.md stub using template.
4. Add package.json scripts "lint:md" / "lint:md:fix" and document .markdownlint.json generation (or instruction to run prepare script).
5. Add a short API reference section (one paragraph per exported factory/helper) in README.

These are small, isolated docs changes that will materially improve public documentation coverage.
</scratchpad>

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (45% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains excellent internal decision documentation (ADRs) and comprehensive implementation guidance in the prompts (detailed design, examples, and test plans). However, the public-facing package documentation required by the Universal Guide and package policy is largely missing. There is no self-contained README for @voder/ui-tools, no CHANGELOG, and no package-level API reference or usage docs in the public docs tree. Mandatory package scripts and markdown-lint wiring (lint:md / lint:md:fix and .markdownlint.json generation) are not present in package.json, and the guidance that currently lives in prompts/ is not exposed in a consumer-visible README/docs location. To reach "adequate" documentation, add a self-contained README (installation, quick-start, examples, API summary, security posture, UNLICENSED notice), a CHANGELOG.md, and package-level usage/API docs; then wire up markdown lint scripts and a visible markdownlint config generator as required.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (75% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall: The dependency set looks intentionally up‑to‑date and aligned with the ADRs (Vitest + V8 coverage pinned to 3.2.4, TypeScript 5.x, jsdom 26.x, PostCSS 8 / Autoprefixer 10, markdownlint-cli2 present). From a static inspection of package.json, there are no obvious old majors except one clear mismatch (see below). However, I cannot confirm known security advisories or transitive vulnerabilities without running npm audit / npm outdated — so this is an informed static assessment, not a live vulnerability scan.

- Freshness / compatibility
  - Good: vitest (@3.2.4) and @vitest/coverage-v8 (@3.2.4) are aligned per ADR-0005 — this is good and avoids the common provider/vitest mismatch.
  - Good: TypeScript (^5.9.2) and @types/node (^24.3.0) are modern and compatible with the repo's ES module / NodeNext setup.
  - Good: jsdom 26.x, postcss 8.x, autoprefixer 10.x, and markdownlint-cli2 0.18.x are recent and consistent with the UI tooling intent.
  - Note: vite is a peerDependency (^6.0.0) — that's fine for a config/tooling package; consumers provide the runtime vite version.

- Security / risk flags (static)
  - High-priority compatibility risk: jest-axe mismatch
    - package.json lists jest-axe in peerDependencies as ^9.0.0, but devDependencies include jest-axe ^10.0.0.
    - This is a major-version mismatch and could lead to test/runtime incompatibilities or failing tests for consumers who install a peer at v9 while the package was developed/tested with v10. It should be reconciled by either downgrading the devDependency to ^9 (if compatibility is required) or updating the peerRequirement and documenting the change (ADR) if v10 is wanted for the package.
  - Transitive/security vulnerabilities: unknown
    - Several packages here (jsdom, postcss, etc.) have had CVEs historically. A static file check cannot determine current advisories or transitive risks. You should run npm audit (or your org's supply‑chain tooling) to get concrete findings.
  - Lockfile state / local changes
    - The history indicates lockfile changes were committed; ensure lockfile is captured and re-audit after any dependency remediation.

- Recommendations (next non-interactive steps you should run)
  1. Run supply‑chain checks to get authoritative results:
     - npm audit --json --no-fund
     - npm outdated --json --no-fund
  2. Immediately resolve the jest-axe mismatch:
     - If package must be peer-compatible with ^9, change devDependency to jest-axe@^9 and update tests, or
     - If v10 is required, update peerDependencies to ^10 and record an ADR explaining the version bump / compatibility for consumers.
     - Bundle the ADR with the package.json/lockfile change (per governance).
  3. If audit reports vulnerabilities, address them incrementally (patch/pin) and commit lockfile updates; re-run tests.

- Bottom line: Static inspection shows generally current and well-aligned dependencies except for a notable jest-axe major-version mismatch that should be fixed before trusting test/integration results. For a definitive security posture, run npm audit and review the audit output.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (70% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary
  - The code in src/ is small and focused (configuration factories and test helpers). There are no obvious runtime network calls, no eval/new Function usage, and no direct inclusion of untrusted input in sensitive sinks inside committed source files. That reduces immediate application-level attack surface.
  - The primary security exposure is supply-chain and lifecycle related (install/build/test tooling, install-time hooks, and third‑party devDependencies). These are the typical and highest-risk areas for this type of package.

- Identified security issues & risks
  1. Supply‑chain / dependency risk (highest risk)
     - Many devDependencies and peerDependencies (postcss, autoprefixer, vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, jsdom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2, etc.). Any of these (or their transitive deps) could have vulnerabilities or could be compromised.
     - Dev vs peer version mismatches may increase risk of unexpected behavior during dev/test runs and could surface dependency resolution issues that bypass expected safeguards.
     - package-lock.json is present (good) but it must be kept up-to-date and audited regularly.
  2. Install-time script risk
     - package.json defines a "prepare" script: "node ../../setup-package-docs.js". Any install (npm install / npm ci) in environments reaching that directory could execute this arbitrary JS file. Prepare scripts are executed during some package lifecycle events and therefore represent an execution surface for arbitrary code at install time.
  3. Execution of child processes in tests/docs (command execution risk)
     - Example/test code and documentation show use of child_process.execSync (npm pack, node ...). If tests are modified to accept external inputs or built using untrusted data, they could become a vector for command injection. Currently the examples use static strings, but test code that spawns shell processes should be audited and avoid interpolating untrusted content.
  4. Test helpers run in jsdom and mount arbitrary DOM
     - Helpers like renderComponent call component.mount(container). If component implementations accept untrusted HTML or set innerHTML from untrusted sources, XSS-like issues in tests won't hurt production but could hide unsafe patterns. Consumers must be aware that tests exercise code that could include unsafe DOM operations.
  5. Credentials / sensitive data in repo metadata
     - The repository contains .voder/ metadata files (history, plan, progress files) that are tracked. Those files can potentially contain sensitive operational data if not reviewed. They should be scanned for secrets. (No explicit secrets observed from the provided snapshot, but tracked metadata is an area to check.)
  6. Configuration of Node / toolchain expectations
     - The project expects modern Node (documents Node >= 22.6.0 in inherited docs). Running on older Node could run different code paths or tools with unresolved vulnerabilities—ensure CI enforces supported engine and security updates.

- Best-practice mitigations / recommended actions (prioritized)
  1. Immediate: Supply‑chain scanning & locking
     - Run `npm audit --json` and address high/critical findings. Capture results to console/history.
     - Ensure package-lock.json is committed and consistent; use lockfile-based installs (`npm ci`) in CI.
     - Add automated SCA scanning (Dependabot/Snyk/other) in CI per project policy (the repo already documents supply-chain audit policy).
     - Prefer pinned versions for critical tooling or at least perform review of transitive upgrades; for tools with peer-alignment constraints (vitest/provider), keep alignment tests (per ADR).
  2. Immediate: Audit install-time hooks
     - Review ../../setup-package-docs.js (the script executed by "prepare") and ensure it is safe (no network calls to untrusted endpoints, no execution of arbitrary templates, no writing of sensitive secrets). Document its behavior in the package README or ADR.
     - If the prepare script is not required in all environments, consider gating it or converting to an explicit developer-only script to reduce attack surface during installs in automation.
  3. Short term: Hardening test/process execution
     - Avoid passing untrusted or external values into child_process.execSync or shell interpolation inside tests. Use execFile or spawn with argument arrays where possible.
     - Audit any tests that run shell commands to ensure they cannot be tricked by environment variables or crafted inputs.
  4. Short term: Secrets scanning
     - Run a secrets scan (git-secrets, trufflehog, or similar) across repo and .voder metadata to ensure no accidental secrets are committed.
  5. Short term: Minimize privileged code executed on install/build
     - Consider documenting or restricting `prepare` activities. Where possible, avoid automatic scripts that perform network requests or arbitrary code execution during a normal `npm install` for downstream consumers.
  6. Medium term: Registry & mirror policy enforcement
     - Enforce registry mirror usage and strict lockfile verification in CI (as suggested by ADRs). Verify integrity of lockfile (shrinkwrap integrity checks) in CI steps to mitigate malicious registry responses.
  7. Medium term: Dependency policy & ADRs
     - Continue the ADR practice: require ADRs for new direct dependencies. Add tests that verify version alignment for known fragile pairings (vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8).
  8. Ongoing: Least privilege & auditability
     - Limit runtime privilege: this package appears to have no runtime network behavior; keep it that way. Ensure that exported code and templates do not perform file I/O or network access at runtime unless explicitly required and documented.
     - Maintain a reproducible and auditable developer environment (lockfiles, pinned tooling in CI, SCA, and supply-chain ADR compliance).

- Low‑risk / informational notes
  - The source code itself contains no obvious input validation bugs, SQL/injection, or direct cryptographic misuses. Most code is configuration generation and test scaffolding.
  - Use of jest-axe/axe-core is safe (client-side accessibility checks); these run in test time only. Ensure test outputs are not persisted in repo (policy forbids output files).
  - The project is private (license UNLICENSED) and not intended for public publish by developers; still treat the code and dev-dependency supply chain as sensitive.

- Recommended quick verification commands (console-first, safe)
  - npm audit --json --no-fund || true
  - npm ci --package-lock-only && npm audit --json --no-fund || true
  - grep -R --line-number "execSync" src tests || true
  - node -e "console.log('prepare script:', require('./package.json').scripts?.prepare||'none')" 

- Confidence & next steps
  - This assessment is based on the committed source and metadata provided. A complete supply-chain analysis requires running `npm audit`, SCA tools, and reviewing the actual contents of install-time scripts (e.g., ../../setup-package-docs.js) and any other repository-root scripts not included in the snapshot.
  - If you want, I can run the safe verification commands (npm audit, grep for execSync, print prepare script) and return console output so we can triage any findings and apply focused fixes.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, publishable state: there are unstaged (uncommitted) modifications and local commits that have not been pushed. Because uncommitted changes exist the overall version‑control completeness must be low — this blocks a fully synchronized, publishable state.
- Specific findings:
  - Uncommitted changes: Git reports modified files (7) in .voder/* (e.g., .voder/history.md, .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md, .voder/progress-chart.png, .voder/progress-log-areas.csv, .voder/progress-log.csv). These are tracked files with local edits that are not staged/committed → fails criterion “ALL CHANGES COMMITTED”.
  - Unpushed commits: Branch main is ahead of origin/main by 2 commits → fails criterion “ALL COMMITS PUSHED”.
  - File tracking / ignores: Good — there are 0 untracked files, .gitignore is present and comprehensive, and project files appear tracked correctly (no important sources are untracked). This satisfies the “PROPER FILE TRACKING” check.
  - Clean working state: Not satisfied. The working tree contains modified tracked files and local commits not pushed; therefore the repo is not clean/synchronized.

Summary judgement: Because uncommitted changes exist the assessment is capped (max 30%); the additional presence of unpushed commits reinforces that the repo is not synchronized. With no untracked important files the score is not further reduced. Overall: 25% ±5% complete.
