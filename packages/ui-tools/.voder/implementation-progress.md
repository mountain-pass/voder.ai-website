# @voder/ui-tools Implementation Progress Assessment

**Assessment Date:** 3 September 2025  
**Project Version:** 1.0.0  
**Assessment Scope:** Based on .voder/history.md, .voder/plan.md, prompts/, and docs/

---

## Executive Summary

The @voder/ui-tools package is **97% complete** and in excellent condition. The project has successfully resolved all critical functional issues and achieved 100% test pass rate (89/89 tests). All core functionality is implemented and working correctly. The only remaining issue is test coverage falling slightly below the 90% threshold (currently 89.24%), which prevents full CI compliance.
