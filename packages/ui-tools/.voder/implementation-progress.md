![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (44% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What’s complete
  - Core scaffolding and governance artifacts exist: tsconfig.json, package.json with sensible scripts (type-check/build/test), .gitignore/.voderignore, and multiple ADRs under docs/decisions. (DOCUMENTATION / DEPENDENCIES / SECURITY strengths)
  - A useful vertical slice is implemented: the PostCSS factory (createPostCSSConfig) exists and is exported from src/index.ts, and at least one unit test was created for that factory. (FUNCTIONALITY: small but correct piece)
  - Dev tooling alignment for Vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 is present in devDependencies (version-aligned), satisfying the ADR requirement for coverage-provider alignment. (DEPENDENCIES / SECURITY)

- What’s missing or broken
  - Feature completeness: The package is missing the majority of requested APIs and features (createViteLibraryConfig, Vitest jsdom config factory, DOM testing helpers, accessibility helpers, linting config factories, templates). The public API is minimal (only PostCSS). Tests and packaging/exports are incomplete. (FUNCTIONALITY 22%)
  - Tests: Coverage is extremely sparse — only a single PostCSS unit test exists. Mandatory test suites (export-equivalence, package-structure, package-installation, smoke tests, vitest-jsdom/accessibility tests) are absent. Coverage is far below the 90% target. (TESTING 12%)
  - Execution / verification: There is no evidence the full verification pipeline (tsc build + tests) has been run and validated in this working tree. The build/test lifecycle is not proven green. (EXECUTION 30%)
  - Scripts & workflow: The standardized scripts required by the Universal Guide (verify, lint/lint:fix, format/format:check, lint:md/lint:md:fix, etc.) and package exports to ./dist are not implemented. This prevents running the prescribed one-command verification and package-structure tests.
  - Documentation for consumers: No public README.md, no CHANGELOG.md, and no consumer-oriented API docs / usage examples in the repository root for @voder/ui-tools. (DOCUMENTATION 35%)
  - Dependency alignment risk: Notable mismatch: peerDependencies require jest-axe ^9.0.0 while devDependencies include jest-axe ^10.0.0 (potential runtime/test incompatibility for consumers). Other deps look modern and vitest/provider alignment is already correct. (DEPENDENCIES 70%)
  - Version control cleanliness: There are tracked but uncommitted modifications (7 .voder/* files). The branch is up-to-date with origin/main, but the working tree is not clean, blocking a fully publishable state. (VERSION_CONTROL 30%)
  - Code quality: For the implemented pieces the code is well-structured and follows TS/ESM conventions, but enforcement (ESLint/Prettier configs, broader tests) is not yet present. (CODE_QUALITY 75%)
  - Security: No obvious code-level vulnerabilities; main risk is supply-chain (devDependencies). Recommend running npm audit and locking/triaging vulnerabilities. (SECURITY 75%)

- Reference to individual assessments
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 22% — only PostCSS piece implemented; most features missing.
  - CODE_QUALITY: 75% — small, focused code is sound; missing lint config and broader enforcement.
  - TESTING: 12% — only one small unit test; mandatory test categories absent.
  - EXECUTION: 30% — build/test not yet validated end-to-end.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 35% — internal ADRs and design docs exist; public README and API docs missing.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 70% — versions are modern; jest-axe major mismatch is a notable issue; need audit.
  - SECURITY: 75% — source low risk; supply-chain and operational recommendations needed.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 30% — uncommitted tracked changes (.voder files) mean working tree not clean.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Based on the lowest scoring areas (TESTING 12%, VERSION_CONTROL 30%, EXECUTION 30%, FUNCTIONALITY 22%), the highest-priority next step is to get the repository into a clean, verifiable state and run the verification pipeline so you have concrete failure output to iterate on.

Immediate prioritized actions (small, safe, POSIX-friendly steps):
1. Clean version control (required before deeper work)
   - Commit or stash the modified .voder metadata files so the working tree is clean (you must choose whether to commit these .voder changes — they were previously committed in your flow). The repo must have NO modified tracked files before moving forward.
2. Run dependency & supply-chain checks (NOW plan step 1)
   - npm audit --json --no-fund || true
   - npm outdated --json --no-fund || true
   - Inspect results and capture console output.
3. Inspect jest-axe / peer mismatch (NOW plan step 2)
   - node -e "const p=require('./package.json'); console.log('peer jest-axe:', p.peerDependencies?.['jest-axe']||'none'); console.log('dev jest-axe:', p.devDependencies?.['jest-axe']||'none');"
   - Decide whether to align jest-axe versions (explicit decision required). If you choose to align, perform the narrow remediation and commit/ push with an ADR if changing peers.
4. Run verification (fail-fast) to see current failures (NOW plan step 4)
   - npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test
   - Capture console output and iterate on the small failures found (adjust only src/, tests/, or tsconfig.json as necessary).
5. Fix immediate failing tests/type-issues
   - Focus on minimal fixes to make verification pass, one focused change at a time, committing each small change. Start by ensuring the PostCSS test and tsc pass.
6. After verification is green:
   - Add the missing mandatory scripts (verify, lint/lint:fix, format), package exports to dist, and the required test suites in priority order: package-structure.test.ts, smoke.test.ts, export-equivalence.test.ts, then vitest-jsdom and accessibility tests.
   - Incrementally implement Vite library factory and vitest-jsdom factory and associated tests (small vertical slices), running verification after each slice.

Rationale: cleaning VERSION_CONTROL and running the verification pipeline (EXECUTION) will produce deterministic failures that tell you the smallest next changes to reach a green state. The biggest blocker to progress is not coding ideas but lack of verified test results and a clean working tree to iterate from.

If you want, I can now:
- Produce a concrete checklist and commands to run in order (POSIX-safe) and interpret the outputs you capture; or
- Implement the next vertical slice (e.g., add src/build/vite-library.ts and its unit tests) in small commits and update scripts/tests incrementally.

Which would you like me to do next?



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (22% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- Implemented (partial):
  - PostCSS factory (createPostCSSConfig) implemented in src/build/postcss.ts and exported from src/index.ts. This delivers the core CSS preprocessing feature (PostCSS + Autoprefixer) mandated by the UI tools ADR.
  - TypeScript project configuration (tsconfig.json) exists and is configured to emit declarations to dist/ (outDir).
  - package.json contains relevant devDependencies/peerDependencies and basic scripts (type-check, build, test, test:ci, clean, prepare, voder), so basic build/test hooks are present.
  - Repository-level housekeeping (.gitignore, .voderignore, ADRs under docs/decisions) and policy artifacts exist, matching many governance requirements.
  - According to the history, at least one unit test for the PostCSS factory was created and committed.

- Present but incomplete / partially compliant:
  - Public API is minimal: src/index.ts only exports the PostCSS factory. The package is expected to expose many more APIs (Vite library config factory, Vitest jsdom config factory, DOM testing helpers, accessibility utilities, linting config factories, utils, templates), but those exports are not present.
  - package.json is missing the dual-export/package "exports" map and the dist-based export targets required by the Dual Export Strategy and package-structure tests.
  - Mandatory standardized scripts required by the Universal Guide (lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix, verify, dev, reset, prebuild/postbuild) are not present. This prevents the prescribed verify pipeline and document-lint hooks from running.
  - Testing surface is far from complete: required test categories (export-equivalence, package-exports, package-installation integration, smoke tests, package-structure validation, coverage thresholds) are absent or not visible. Only PostCSS-related testing (a small unit) exists.
  - Build and packaging workflow is not implemented end-to-end:
    - No src/build/vite-library.ts implementation.
    - No scripts or copy:assets steps to populate dist/ (and no dist/ artifacts exist in the repo).
    - No tests validating package.json exports point to dist/.
  - UI testing utilities (vitest-jsdom.ts, helpers.ts, accessibility.ts, setup.ts) are not implemented: the package should provide jsdom testing setup, jest-axe integration, and DOM helpers but these are missing.
  - Linting factories for HTML/CSS/accessibility are not implemented/exported as specified.
  - Template/example files (vite.config.ts, vitest.config.ts, test-setup.jsdom.ts) are not present.
  - README, CHANGELOG, and public documentation for consumers are missing (README is required to be self-contained and include license/security posture).
  - Policy-required automated checks for version alignment (e.g., vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8) and supply-chain tests are not implemented as test code.

- Major functional gaps against the specification:
  - The package does not yet provide the majority of features enumerated in the implementation guide: Vite config factory, testing utilities, accessibility helpers, linting configs, templates, and comprehensive tests. The single implemented factory (PostCSS) is an important starting piece but only a small vertical slice.
  - The testing and packaging requirements (export-resolution tests, package-installation integration tests, smoke tests, 90%+ coverage targets and public API coverage) are not satisfied.
  - The prescribed developer scripts and the "verify" single-command quality gate are not implemented, so the package cannot be validated per the project's mandated workflow.

- Overall assessment:
  - The repository contains a correct and valuable first step (PostCSS + Autoprefixer factory, TS config, dependency declarations), but it is far from feature-complete. Many required APIs, tests, packaging/export mechanics, and scripts remain to be implemented before the package meets its specified functional requirements.
  - Estimate: ~22% complete (±8%) — the core CSS preprocessing piece and basic scaffolding exist, but ~75–85% of the required functionality (testing utilities, build configs, linting factories, templates, export/package validation, documentation, and mandatory scripts/tests) is still missing.

<scratchpad>
Check files provided:
- src/index.ts exports createPostCSSConfig from './build/postcss.js' — expects src/build/postcss.ts to exist and be referenced with .js extension (ESM import strategy). With tsconfig moduleResolution: NodeNext this is an accepted pattern, but TypeScript can emit "Cannot find module './build/postcss.js'" at compile time depending on compiler options; however earlier history shows postcss.ts was added and tests were created — likely compiles in practice but it's a risk to call out.
- tsconfig.json is strict, ES2022, ESNext, declarations enabled. Good quality.
- package.json scripts are present (type-check, build, test). Good.
- Only one public export in src/index.ts — minimal but coherent.
- Tests referenced in history: a PostCSS unit test was added and force-committed. That indicates automated verification exists but coverage is very narrow.
- Linting / formatting files (eslint, prettier) are not present in repo yet (per file list). That affects code quality enforcement but not immediate correctness.
- package.json has both peerDependencies and devDependencies for some packages (e.g., autoprefixer, jest-axe). That is a valid pattern but mismatched major versions (peer jest-axe ^9.0.0 vs dev 10.0.0) could cause issues — this is a dependency alignment concern (not strictly code correctness) but can affect tests and runtime.
- .gitignore policies were respected except a forced add of a test file that was previously ignored — process oddity, but code quality unaffected.
- API code is small, focused, well-documented in prompts/decisions; createPostCSSConfig earlier was implemented with sensible defaults and JSDoc per history.

Risks / likely problems:
- TypeScript module import with explicit .js extension can produce "Cannot find module" in tsc if not resolved; NodeNext usually resolves it but careful with "imports" at compile-time.
- Narrow test coverage; public API surface may be insufficiently exercised.
- Missing ESLint / Prettier config files in the package root means style/lint enforcement not yet applied.
- Some dev/peer dep mismatches might surface during 'npm run test' or during TypeScript compile if type packages differ.

Overall: code is small and well organized, follows repository ESM/TS conventions, but maturity and enforcement (linting, broader tests, dependency alignment) are early. Estimate quality around three-quarters complete.
</scratchpad>

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (75% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The codebase is small, focused, and follows the project's ESM + TypeScript conventions: strict tsconfig settings, explicit .js import ext in source barrels, and a minimal public API (createPostCSSConfig) that matches the documented design. The PostCSS factory implementation (per history) uses sensible defaults and is testable.
- Strengths: clear separation of responsibility, meaningful typings, declarations enabled, appropriate scripts (type-check/build/test) present, and the source files adhere to single-responsibility and naming conventions.
- Issues / concerns that reduce score:
  - Potential TypeScript resolution fragility: src/index.ts imports './build/postcss.js' while the source file is .ts. This ESM-style explicit .js reference is an accepted pattern with NodeNext resolution but can provoke tsc "cannot find module" diagnostics in some setups — verify with tsc. (This is the most likely source of a build-time problem.)
  - Very limited automated test coverage currently — only a focused PostCSS unit test exists per history. The public API and error paths are not comprehensively tested.
  - Linting and formatting enforcement files (ESLint, Prettier configs) are absent from the package root, so coding-style correctness is not yet enforced.
  - Dependency alignment: dev vs peer dependency version mismatch (notably jest-axe peer ^9 vs dev 10) is a risk that can cause test/runtime failures; while this is a dependency management issue, it will affect test runs and therefore code verification.
  - A test file had to be force-committed despite .gitignore rules — indicates repository-process rough edges (not a code bug but relevant to maintainability).
- Recommendation summary (code-quality oriented): run a full type-check and build (tsc --noEmit && tsc -p tsconfig.json) to confirm module resolution with explicit .js imports; expand unit and integration tests to cover the public API and error cases; add ESLint/Prettier configs and lint scripts to enforce style; and align dev/peer dependency versions to avoid test-time surprises.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (12% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Current test surface is minimal and incomplete. I only see a single committed unit test (tests/build/postcss.test.ts) that exercises the PostCSS factory; the broader test matrix required by the project (vite-library factory, vitest-jsdom/testing helpers, accessibility utilities, linting config generation, export-equivalence, package-structure, package-installation integration, smoke tests, and the dependency-alignment tests required by ADRs) is missing.
- Because only one small unit test exists, overall test coverage will be very low (far below the project's 90% coverage goal). No coverage reports or coverage artifacts are present here, so I cannot confirm coverage numbers.
- I cannot be certain whether the existing test(s) pass in this environment without executing the test runner. The repository has vitest and related devDependencies declared, so the single test is likely to run, but that has not been verified.
- Short summary:
  - Are there appropriate tests? Partially for PostCSS only — many mandatory categories (export/package-structure, export-equivalence, smoke, installation integration, Vite factory, jsdom helpers, accessibility, linting configs, version-alignment) are not implemented.
  - Are tests passing? Unknown — tests have not been executed here; presence of devDeps makes them runnable, but no run results are available.
  - Is coverage adequate? No — with only one targeted unit test, coverage is far below the required thresholds.
- Recommended next steps (small, test-focused slices):
  1. Run the test suite: npm test (capture output). Confirm the existing test passes and collect coverage.
  2. Add the mandatory test categories incrementally in this order: package-structure.test.ts, smoke.test.ts, export-equivalence.test.ts, tests for createViteLibraryConfig, and vitest-jsdom/helpers/accessibility tests. After each addition run tests and ensure they pass.
  3. Add an automated test that asserts vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8 version alignment per ADR.
  4. Aim to incrementally increase coverage toward the 90% target, focusing on public API exports first.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (30% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains a valid TypeScript setup, devDependencies (vitest, typescript, postcss, autoprefixer, jsdom, jest-axe, etc.), and package.json scripts for type-check, build, and tests — so the project is structurally prepared to run. However, there is no evidence in the provided information that the build/test/type-check scripts have actually been executed successfully in this working tree. Git status shows modified .voder metadata files but no recent successful build/test outputs captured. Therefore the software has not yet been proven to run or been fully validated; running the verification sequence (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) is the next required step to confirm execution.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (35% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository has good internal decision documentation (multiple ADRs under docs/decisions/) and thorough design/implementation guidance in the prompts (prompts/development-ui-tools.md and prompts/universal-guide.md). Those are high‑quality, detailed artifacts that capture architecture, policies, and implementation intent — valuable for maintainers and LLM-agents.

- Critical public‑facing and package‑level documentation is missing or incomplete:
  - No README.md in the package root (packages/ui-tools README is required and must be self-contained per the Universal Guide).
  - No CHANGELOG.md present.
  - No API reference docs describing the public surface of @voder/ui-tools (functions, types, usage examples) beyond the internal prompt text.
  - docs/libraries/usage/ contains a helpful voder-dev-config usage doc, but nothing that documents ui-tools usage for consumers.
  - No generated .markdownlint.json or guidance in the package README describing how to run the mandatory markdown linting steps (and package.json does not include lint:md / lint:md:fix scripts required by policy).
  - No published-style examples or short quick-start (install, basic usage) in a user-visible README — required for package consumers.
  - Templates/ example files are listed in the design doc but not documented for consumer adoption (where they live and how to use them).
  - No CHANGELOG template and no ADRs documenting some dependency changes that the ADR policies require (some ADRs exist, good coverage for decisions, but dependency ADR linkage could be improved).

- What is present and strong:
  - ADRs are well-populated and follow the MADR-style policy — good traceability of architectural choices.
  - Extensive implementation guide (prompts/development-ui-tools.md) that effectively documents intended APIs, behaviors, and tests — excellent internal design documentation.
  - docs/libraries contains usage for @voder/dev-config (useful as an example of public documentation style).

- Risk / Impact:
  - Consumers (and external humans) lack a self-contained README and quick start to install and use @voder/ui-tools.
  - Automated policy items (markdown linting, README isolation, license, engine info) require explicit documentation to be consumer-ready.
  - Lack of API docs and examples increases friction for adopters and may cause incorrect usage.

- Recommended minimal next steps (small, prioritized items):
  1. Add a package README.md (self-contained) with:
     - Purpose, compatibility (Node engine), installation example, quick-start usage for key exports (createPostCSSConfig, createViteLibraryConfig, createVitestJsdomConfig, testing helpers).
     - Security posture and proprietary license notice (UNLICENSED).
     - Short example showing how to use the package in a vite config and a vitest config.
  2. Add an API reference section (can be a README subsection) listing exported functions/types and short examples. Link to src/index.ts exports.
  3. Add CHANGELOG.md (use the provided template) and mention ADRs available in docs/decisions/.
  4. Add docs/libraries/usage/ui-tools.md (consumer-oriented usage docs) modeled on voder-dev-config.md.
  5. Ensure package.json scripts for markdown linting (lint:md / lint:md:fix) and document their usage in README.
  6. Add a short CONTRIBUTING or Developer Quick Start section showing verify/build/test commands.
  7. Optionally, generate a small API doc (markdown) for each major module (build/, testing/, linting/) if public API grows.

- Overall conclusion:
  - Internal/documentation-for-developers (ADRs, design prompts) is strong and largely complete.
  - Public, consumer-oriented documentation (README, API reference, CHANGELOG, usage examples) is missing and should be added before considering the package well-documented for external users.
  - Score reflects heavy strengths in internal design docs but significant gaps in consumer/public documentation.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (70% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall: The declared dependencies & devDependencies look reasonably recent and mostly compatible with one another, but I cannot deterministically confirm absence of security vulnerabilities without running `npm audit` / `npm outdated`. Based on the version ranges in package.json:
  - Strengths
    - Vitest and its V8 coverage provider are aligned: devDeps include `vitest: ^3.2.4` and `@vitest/coverage-v8: ^3.2.4`, matching the ADR requirement for version alignment — this is good for deterministic test runs.
    - Core build/test tooling versions (TypeScript ^5.x, vitest 3.2.x, postcss 8.x, jsdom 26.x) are modern major versions and likely supported by the stated Node >=22.6.0 requirement.
    - Use of caret ranges (^) for most packages allows receiving compatible updates while avoiding unnecessary pinning.
  - Concerns / risks
    - Peer vs dev mismatch for jest-axe: package.json lists `peerDependencies.jest-axe: ^9.0.0` while devDependencies include `jest-axe: ^10.0.0`. That indicates a major-version mismatch between what the package advertises consumers should install (v9) and what the package was developed/tested with (v10). This can produce runtime/test incompatibilities for consumers and should be reconciled (either align peer -> ^10 or dev -> ^9 and document the ADR decision).
    - Other potential consumer-visible mismatches: peers include `autoprefixer: ^10.0.0` and dev has `autoprefixer: ^10.4.21` (same major, fine). `postcss` peer ^8 and dev ^8.5.6 (fine). `vite` is listed as a peer (^6.0.0) but not present in devDependencies — this is acceptable for a config package but requires consumers to install vite; ensure documentation is clear.
    - The presence of a local file dependency (`@voder/dev-config: file:../dev-config`) means effective dependency resolution depends on workspace layout; it's fine for monorepo development but verify consumer expectations for published package.
    - Without running `npm audit` we cannot be sure about transitive vulnerabilities. Modern major versions reduce but do not eliminate risk.
  - Recommendation (next concrete steps)
    1. Run: `npm audit --json --no-fund || true` and `npm outdated --json --no-fund || true` (these are in your planned NOW sequence) to get exact vulnerability and freshness data.
    2. Reconcile the jest-axe mismatch intentionally: choose whether consumers should use v9 or v10 and update peerDependencies or devDependencies respectively (and record an ADR if changing peer deps).
    3. If `npm audit` surfaces high/critical vulnerabilities, follow the ADR and remediation policy: make minimal dependency updates, add ADRs for any new direct dependencies or exact pins, and re-run verification (`npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test`).
    4. Add a test that asserts vitest & coverage-provider version alignment (per ADR) — you already have both dev versions aligned, but an automated check guards against accidental drift.
- Confidence: Medium. This assessment identifies clear policy/compatibility issues (jest-axe major mismatch) and recommends the audit/outdated checks to confirm security state. Running those commands will raise the assessment to near-complete.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (75% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary: The current codebase contains no obvious direct runtime vulnerabilities (no network calls, no eval/Function, no unsafe deserialization) in the shipped source (src/) as provided. Most modules are configuration factories and test helpers; the single exported implementation (createPostCSSConfig) is straightforward and does not execute untrusted code. However, there are several security-relevant considerations and supply‑chain risks that should be addressed to reduce attack surface and improve operational safety.

Findings and recommendations

1. Supply‑chain (dependency) risk — high priority
   - The package.json includes many devDependencies and peerDependencies (vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, postcss, autoprefixer, jsdom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2, etc.). These increase supply‑chain attack surface.
   - Recommendation: Run automated SCA regularly (npm audit, Snyk/OSS‑scanner), pin/lock carefully, review transitive dependencies of critical dev tools and update per ADR. Ensure package-lock.json is committed (history suggests it is), and protect lockfile integrity in CI. Consider vendor‑scanning of packages and adding package verification policies.

2. Version / engine constraints not enforced in package.json — medium
   - Docs reference Node >=22.6 for TypeScript config support, but package.json does not declare an engines field. This can lead to contributors running with older Node versions which may have known vulnerabilities or lack security fixes.
   - Recommendation: Add "engines": { "node": ">=22.6.0" } to package.json and surface this in installation docs / CI.

3. Test/integration scripts use child_process.execSync in example tests (docs/plans) — caution
   - Planned/example tests and package-installation tests call execSync/npm pack and execute node commands. Use of child_process to shell out in tests can be risky if inputs are not controlled (command injection) and can run arbitrary code on the host machine.
   - Recommendation: Keep execSync usage limited to controlled test flows, avoid interpolating untrusted input into shell commands, and prefer spawn with argument arrays or programmatic APIs where possible. Run such tests in isolated CI environments.

4. Use of jsdom / jest-axe — low risk but consider test data handling
   - Accessibility checks using jest-axe operate over DOM content. If tests feed or parse untrusted HTML (e.g., from fixtures), axe could surface unexpected behaviors; more importantly, tests that process third‑party HTML should be sandboxed to avoid executing malicious content in developer machines.
   - Recommendation: Treat any test fixtures that originate externally as untrusted; sanitize or validate before insertion into jsdom. Run tests in CI containers, not on developer machines when testing unknown inputs.

5. Test helpers and global test-side effects — moderate
   - setup.ts imports '@testing-library/jest-dom' and extends global test matchers (expect). While normal for tests, be sure these side effects are not executed in production contexts. Exports should not perform side effects on import.
   - Recommendation: Ensure test-only modules are not imported at runtime by consumers; document that setup functions are test-only. Avoid top-level side effects in modules that are part of the public API.

6. Configuration injection surfaces — low/medium
   - createPostCSSConfig accepts plugins array and browsers option and returns a config object. If consumers pass arbitrary plugins, that results in executing third‑party plugin code during builds. This is expected, but it's a potential vector if untrusted plugins are installed.
   - Recommendation: Document that plugin arrays execute arbitrary code at build time; encourage reviewing plugin dependencies and prefer pinned versions. Consider validating plugin types or offering a whitelist for internal usage.

7. File system / temp handling guidance — good, but ensure enforcement
   - The universal guide enforces writing temp files only to OS temp and avoiding repository files. This is positive. But ensure any future utilities (file-utils, config-utils) follow the guide to avoid inadvertent repo writes that could leak sensitive data.
   - Recommendation: Add unit tests that assert utilities do not write inside repo root (or add runtime guards) and CI checks that detect forbidden file creations during runs.

8. Committed ignored/forbidden files incident — operational risk
   - History indicates a test file was force-added despite being in ignored paths. This shows potential for accidental commits of forbidden artifacts (logs, diagnostics) that may contain secrets.
   - Recommendation: Add a precommit or CI check to scan diffs for forbidden suffixes/patterns (as suggested in guide). Consider adding a simple git pre-commit hook in developer bootstrap (but do not rely on it alone).

9. No explicit hardening for malicious package installs — medium
   - There is no mention of package signature verification or registry mirroring enforcement in package.json or tooling. ADRs reference registry-mirror policy, but implementation is manual.
   - Recommendation: Configure CI to use locked registries/mirrors and enable lockfile integrity checks. Consider pinning critical dev tools with stricter ranges and running deterministic installs in CI (npm ci).

10. Public API and runtime exposure — low
    - The package currently exports only createPostCSSConfig; no runtime code interacts with network or sensitive operations. Continue the pattern of limiting exports to configuration factories and test helpers to minimize runtime privileges.

Severity summary
- Highest practical risk: supply‑chain attacks through devDependencies and transitive packages (mitigate via SCA, pinning, lockfile protection).
- Medium: unsafe use of child_process in tests/integration flows; lack of enforced Node engine; potential accidental commit of forbidden files.
- Low: no direct code-level injection/eval or network-exposed code in current src files.

Actionable next steps (priority order)
1. Run npm audit and SCA tooling; triage and fix high/critical dependency issues. Commit and protect lockfile.
2. Add "engines" to package.json to declare Node version constraints.
3. Limit and sanitize any use of child_process in tests; avoid interpolated shell invocation.
4. Add diff/CI checks to block forbidden file types from being committed; ensure .gitignore coverage and pre-commit scanning.
5. Document plugin execution risks for createPostCSSConfig and recommend pinning/trust policies for build plugins.
6. Ensure test modules do not execute top-level side effects that could leak into runtime.

Conclusion: current source is low risk, but dependency and operational practices create measurable supply‑chain and operational risk. Addressing dependency hygiene, Node engine enforcement, and safer test invocation patterns will materially reduce security exposure.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (30% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, publishable state: there are unstaged/modified tracked files in the working tree, so NOT all changes are committed. This alone caps completeness per your rules.
- Synchronization with remote is good: the current branch is reported as "up to date with 'origin/main'" (no unpushed commits).
- File tracking is reasonable: there are 0 untracked files and the .gitignore covers build outputs and temporary files. Important files appear tracked; no large unignored artifacts are present.
- Specifics:
  - Uncommitted modified tracked files (7): 
    - .voder/history.md
    - .voder/implementation-progress.md
    - .voder/last-action.md
    - .voder/plan.md
    - .voder/progress-chart.png
    - .voder/progress-log-areas.csv
    - .voder/progress-log.csv
  - Branch status: main is up to date with origin/main (no local commits waiting to push).
  - File-tracking summary: 28 tracked files, 0 untracked files; 7 modified files.
- Conclusion: Because there are tracked but uncommitted modifications, the repository cannot be considered fully managed under version control per your completeness rules. Fixing the uncommitted changes (commit, stash, or discard as appropriate) is required to move the repo toward a clean, publishable state.
