![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (56% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What’s complete
  - Core scaffolding and a small, correct vertical slice are present: a working PostCSS factory (createPostCSSConfig) exported from src/index.ts, TypeScript configuration, package.json scripts for build/test/type-check, and a guarded vite.config.ts. (FUNCTIONALITY: 30%)
  - Code is high quality for the implemented surface: readable, typed, and aligned with ESM/NodeNext patterns. (CODE_QUALITY: 85%)
  - Dependencies are modern and version-aligned where it matters (vitest + coverage provider) and an earlier npm audit reported zero vulnerabilities. (DEPENDENCIES: 85%)
  - Security posture is acceptable for a dev-tooling package; no obvious application-layer vulnerabilities in source code, though operational supply-chain and secret-history concerns were noted. (SECURITY: 80%)
  - Partial execution worked: tsc --noEmit and earlier Vitest runs succeeded; however the full verification pipeline is currently blocked by build issues (TS5055). (EXECUTION: 70%)
  - Documentation and ADRs are strong on rationale and design decisions; internal implementation guidance exists. (DOCUMENTATION: 55%)

- What’s missing / failing
  - Major functionality absent: many required features from the @voder/ui-tools spec are unimplemented — createViteLibraryConfig, the jsdom/vitest testing factory and helpers, accessibility helpers, linting factories, templates, and the dual export strategy. The package only implements the PostCSS factory so far (FUNCTIONALITY: 30%).
  - Testing is insufficient: only minimal smoke and package-structure tests exist; unit tests and the full suite required by the spec (Vite factory, testing helpers, linting factories, export-equivalence, package-installation integration) are missing. Coverage is far from the required thresholds. (TESTING: 15%)
  - Build reproducibility issue reported: TypeScript emitted errors (TS5055) because tsc attempted to overwrite files under dist/; this blocks the build step and prevents full verification. (EXECUTION note)
  - Version control is not in a clean state: there are unstaged modifications in .voder/* files (seven modified files), preventing a clean working tree. (VERSION_CONTROL: 30%)
  - Consumer-facing README, CHANGELOG, and package-level markdown-lint wiring are absent; package scripts required by the universal guide are incomplete. (DOCUMENTATION: 55%)

- Summary of numeric findings (sub-assessments):
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 30%
  - CODE_QUALITY: 85%
  - TESTING: 15%
  - EXECUTION: 70%
  - DOCUMENTATION: 55%
  - DEPENDENCIES: 85%
  - SECURITY: 80%
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 30%

## NEXT PRIORITY
Based on the lowest-scoring areas (TESTING 15%, VERSION_CONTROL 30%, FUNCTIONALITY 30%) the immediate highest-priority action is an operational verification step that clears the blocking issues and enables iterative work:

1. Clean up version control (immediate, single step)
   - Commit or stash the modified .voder/* files so the working tree is clean (the repo currently shows 7 modified .voder files). A clean working tree is required before further verification and makes CI/results reproducible. This addresses VERSION_CONTROL (30%) and removes the gating friction.

2. Fix the build-blocker and re-run full verification (single iteration)
   - Ensure tsconfig.json excludes dist/ (prevent tsc from trying to overwrite compiled files). If the exclusion is already present, re-run the verification pipeline to confirm whether TS5055 persists:
     - npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr
   - Inspect the console output; if TS5055 or other build errors remain, apply the smallest single corrective fix (e.g., fix tsconfig exclude, remove/disambiguate any committed dist files, or remove stray dist/ declarations that confuse tsc).

3. Add a focused unit test for the implemented surface (unblock TESTING and FUNCTIONALITY)
   - After the build runs cleanly, add a unit test that exercises createPostCSSConfig (tests/build/postcss.test.ts) asserting:
     - returns an object with plugins array,
     - includes autoprefixer with the default browsers list.
   - Commit and re-run verification (type-check → build → test). This small test improves test coverage, verifies implementation correctness, and demonstrates the verification loop.

Why these are the next priorities
- A clean repository (VERSION_CONTROL) is required to make reproducible changes and to push commits safely.
- Fixing the build blocker (TS5055) is required to run the full verification pipeline — without it, tests and packaging cannot be validated (EXECUTION and TESTING remain blocked).
- Adding a minimal unit test for createPostCSSConfig is the first incremental quality step toward meeting the required TESTING goals and increases functional confidence of the only implemented feature (FUNCTIONALITY).

After these three items succeed, continue iterative work in small steps:
- Implement missing source features one at a time (vite factory, testing helpers, linting factories), adding targeted unit tests for each change and running verification after each commit.
- Add required package scripts (lint, format, lint:md), generate .markdownlint.json, and create README/CHANGELOG.
- Expand tests to cover export-equivalence and package-installation integration.

Note: Do not attempt large sweeping changes. Follow the single-change-per-iteration discipline: implement one small change, run verification, inspect results, repeat. This will move the project steadily from the current 56% toward completion.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (30% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Implemented / working items (partial success)
  - PostCSS factory implemented: createPostCSSConfig exists in src/build/postcss.ts and is exported via the package barrel. This matches the core CSS preprocessing requirement (PostCSS + Autoprefixer) in the guide.
  - Minimal public export barrel in src/index.ts is present and exports createPostCSSConfig.
  - TypeScript project scaffolding exists (tsconfig.json) and package.json has build/test/type-check scripts and appropriate devDependencies declared (typescript, vitest, postcss, autoprefixer, etc.).
  - Two Vitest-based tests exist (package-structure and smoke) and their compiled counterparts are present in dist/tests. These tests exercise basic package export resolution and that the compiled entry exports createPostCSSConfig.
  - Vite config guard exists to avoid failing when optional plugin is not installed (practical robustness).
  - ADRs and documentation for many policy/decisions exist (useful contextual artifacts, though not strictly functionality).

- Missing or incomplete required features (major gaps)
  - Vite library configuration factory (createViteLibraryConfig) is described in the guide but NOT implemented in src/build/vite-library.ts — required functionality for library build configurations is missing.
  - Testing suite for UI (jsdom-focused): createVitestJsdomConfig, testing helpers (renderComponent, waitForAnimation, simulateClick), accessibility utilities (expectAccessible, getAccessibilityViolations), and test environment setup (setupJsdomTestEnvironment) are described but not implemented in src/testing/*. Those are mandatory per the UI-tools scope.
  - Linting configuration factories (createHTMLLintConfig, createCSSLintConfig, createAccessibilityLintConfig) are specified in the guide but not implemented under src/linting/.
  - Templates (templates/*) and example config files are absent.
  - Many mandatory scripts and tooling patterns required by the universal guide are missing:
    - No lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix scripts in package.json (only prepare, voder, type-check, build, test, test:ci, clean).
    - No markdownlint config generator / .markdownlint.json creation script present.
  - Dual export strategy: package.json exports are minimal (only "." import -> ./dist/src/index.js). The guide requires dual/dedicated export paths for components like ./testing, ./prettier, ./eslint — these are not present.
  - Comprehensive required tests are missing:
    - Unit tests for the PostCSS factory exist only as a planned next step (not yet present in src/tests).
    - Missing tests for Vite config, testing utilities, linting config generation, export equivalence, package-installation integration, coverage thresholds, and the wide range of mandatory categories defined by the spec.
  - Coverage & policy requirements (90% thresholds, 100% public API coverage) are not met — not enough tests to reach these levels.
  - Prettier/ESLint integration files required by the universal guide (prettier.config.ts, eslint.config.js importing @voder/dev-config layers) are not present.
  - Some build-state issues were reported (TS5055: tsc attempted to overwrite files in dist/) — indicating build reproducibility problems remain (affects ability to validate full functionality end-to-end).

- Compatibility vs. spec
  - The single implemented feature (PostCSS factory) aligns with the documented requirement and is exportable/consumable via the compiled entry, which allows the current smoke/package-structure tests to pass for that narrow surface.
  - However, the package is far from delivering the full scope of @voder/ui-tools: library build config factory, testing helpers, accessibility utilities, linting factories, templates, required scripts, and the mandatory test coverage/integration work are not implemented.

- Overall conclusion
  - The repository contains a correct starting vertical slice (PostCSS + autoprefixer factory, build/test scaffolding, minimal tests), but the majority of requested features and verification requirements are not yet implemented. Functionality completeness is low: core CSS processing exists, but the broader UI-tooling surface (build factory, testing utilities, linting config, tests, scripts, dual exports, verification coverage) is still missing and needs iterative implementation and testing.

- Rough progress estimate toward full functional completion: ~30% (±10%).

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The codebase is small, well-scoped, and largely correct for the functionality present. The public API (src/index.ts) cleanly re-exports the implemented PostCSS factory (src/build/postcss.ts) using ESM-style import/export patterns (explicit .js extension for runtime paths), which aligns with the project's ESM/NodeNext configuration and the repository conventions.
- Implementations are straightforward and readable: createPostCSSConfig uses sensible defaults, documents options, and composes autoprefixer with an extensible plugins array. Tests that exist (smoke and package-structure) target the compiled outputs and package.json exports as required by the project patterns.
- TypeScript configuration is strict and appropriate (strict mode, declaration generation, NodeNext), and src files use explicit types where practical. The project correctly uses "esModuleInterop": true to aid interop with CommonJS-style packages.
- Noted issues / areas to monitor:
  - Potential runtime interop: importing autoprefixer as a default import depends on the installed autoprefixer package format and Node/TS interop handling. Given esModuleInterop and the project's devDeps, this is likely fine, but it is a surface to watch if runtime errors appear when invoking the factory (especially in environments with different module resolution behavior).
  - Minor stylistic inconsistencies (leading/trailing whitespace, file header comments) exist but do not affect correctness. There is no committed ESLint/prettier configuration in the package yet; code-quality tooling and enforcement are still to be added per the larger plan.
  - Tests currently are minimal: the smoke test verifies the export exists but does not exercise createPostCSSConfig behavior (no unit test yet validating autoprefixer presence or plugin content). Increasing test coverage for the public API (calling createPostCSSConfig and asserting structure) would strengthen correctness guarantees.
  - Historically the repo experienced tsc TS5055 issues due to dist being present as inputs; tsconfig.json now excludes dist — confirm rebuilds behave consistently in CI/local environments. (This is an operational note rather than a code bug; the tsconfig change addresses it.)
  - package.json and typings in dist reference .js paths in exports/d.ts; while this follows the project's ESM pattern, keep an eye on consumers and tooling that may expect different path shapes.
- Overall judgement: the implemented code is correct and follows the project's patterns and standards in spirit. The code is simple and maintainable; the few noted concerns (module interop edge-case, missing unit tests and tooling enforcement) are low-risk and straightforward to address in follow-up incremental changes.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (15% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Current test surface: There are two formal Vitest test suites in the repository:
  - tests/package-structure.test.ts — validates package.json exports point to ./dist/* files and that those files exist.
  - tests/smoke.test.ts — a smoke test that imports the compiled entry (../dist/src/index.js) and asserts createPostCSSConfig is exported as a function.
  Compiled equivalents are present under dist/tests/*.js, and earlier runs (before the most recent failing build) reported Vitest running 2 tests and both passing.

- Test execution status: The most recent "verify" run failed during the TypeScript build step (TS5055 errors) so the full verification pipeline (build → tests) did not complete; therefore the latest CI-style run did not execute the Vitest suites. Historically, Vitest ran and passed the two tests, but current pipeline is blocked by the build error.

- Coverage and scope:
  - There is no coverage report checked into the repo and the current tests do not exercise most of the package surface. The tests only cover:
    - Export resolution / packaging correctness
    - A minimal smoke check for the presence of one exported function
  - The repository guide and ADRs require comprehensive tests (unit tests for PostCSS factory, Vite factory, jsdom helpers, accessibility utilities, lint config factories, export-equivalence, package-installation integration, and high coverage thresholds — typically 90%+). None of these required suites are present.
  - Because very little logic is tested, overall code coverage is expected to be very low (single-digit to low‑teens percent). No coverage artifact is available to confirm an exact number.

- Gaps / risks:
  - Missing unit tests for createPostCSSConfig behavior (e.g., autoprefixer plugin presence and default browsers), createViteLibraryConfig, testing helpers, accessibility helpers, and linting config factories.
  - Missing integration/package-installation tests that validate exports from actual packaged output.
  - No automated tests enforcing dependency/version alignment requirements (e.g., vitest / @vitest/coverage-v8).
  - The required high coverage targets and mandatory test categories from the universal guide are not met.

- Conclusion: Testing currently provides only a very small safety net focused on packaging and a tiny smoke check. While those tests have passed in earlier runs, the test suite is far from adequate for the package's stated requirements. Estimated testing completeness: ~15% (±10%).

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (70% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Partial: Type-checking (tsc --noEmit) succeeds and Vitest tests have run previously, but the full verification pipeline did not complete successfully. The build step (tsc -p tsconfig.json) fails with TS5055 errors: tsc is trying to write declaration files into dist/ locations that already exist as inputs (errors show attempts to overwrite dist/src/build/postcss.d.ts and dist/src/index.d.ts). Because of those TS5055 write conflicts the npm run build (and therefore the combined verification: type-check → build → test) fails, so the package is not fully built or validated end-to-end.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (55% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains strong documentary artifacts for design and decisions: multiple MADR ADRs under docs/decisions, usage guidance for PostCSS and dev-config, and high‑level package implementation guides in prompts/*. These provide excellent rationale, design history, and intent for maintainers and LLM-agents.
- There are also inlined usage examples and API-like snippets in prompts/development-ui-tools.md and docs/libraries/usage/*. These show how to use primary factories (e.g., createViteLibraryConfig, createVitestJsdomConfig) and include test examples — helpful for implementers.

What’s good (highlights)
- Complete ADR coverage for important choices (dev deps, PostCSS, markdown linting, vitest alignment).
- Detailed implementation guide (prompts/development-ui-tools.md) with code examples, API snippets, and test patterns.
- docs/libraries/usage includes helpful contextual pages (PostCSS, dev-config quickstart).
- Tests and source code provide working examples which double as executable documentation for API surface.

What’s missing / incomplete (key gaps)
- No package README.md present for @voder/ui-tools (README.md is required and must be self-contained and public-facing per the Universal Guide). This is the single largest omission.
- No CHANGELOG.md present (template exists in guidance but not filled for the package).
- No generated or human-written API reference that lists exported functions/types and their signatures besides the examples embedded in prompts — consumers expect a concise README + API section.
- No "security posture" section in a README (required by policy).
- No explicit installation / quickstart README for this package (how to install, peer-dev dependency notes, Node version requirement).
- No top-level .markdownlint.json or documented generation script committed (docs reference generating .markdownlint.json from @voder/dev-config — the mechanism is described but not present as a runnable script or produced file).
- No dedicated docs/usage page for @voder/ui-tools itself (there are general examples in the prompts but not a published package README or docs page).
- Documentation required scripts and package scripts (lint:md, lint:md:fix, verify, format, etc.) are referenced in policies but package.json is minimal — documentation and scripts are out of sync.
- No CHANGELOG or release notes; README template referenced but not instantiated.

Recommended next actions (prioritized)
1. Add a self-contained README.md in the package root implementing the required README template: purpose, compatibility (Node >= 22.6.0), installation, quickstart examples, API summary of public exports, security posture, and license text (UNLICENSED).
2. Add a minimal CHANGELOG.md (Keep a Changelog initial entry) so future releases have a place to record changes.
3. Create a short API reference section in README (or docs/api.md) that lists exported factories and utilities (createPostCSSConfig signature, createVitestJsdomConfig, testing helpers, accessibility helpers) with short examples — use existing examples from prompts/development-ui-tools.md.
4. Ensure markdown linting workflow is wired up (generate .markdownlint.json from @voder/dev-config or add the generator script) and add the lint:md scripts mentioned in the guide so docs themselves are validated.
5. Add a small docs/usage/ui-tools.md that consolidates the usage snippets already present in prompts and links to ADRs and API examples.
6. Add a brief CONTRIBUTING or DEVELOPMENT section (how to run tests, build, verify) to README to match the workflows referenced in the guides.

Summary
- Docs and ADRs are strong on architectural rationale and design decisions, and the implementation-guides/prompts are comprehensive for developers and LLM agents. However the repository lacks consumer-facing, self-contained package documentation (README, API reference, CHANGELOG, security posture) required by the Universal Guide and package policy. Filling these missing artifacts will move the documentation from “good internal design docs” to a complete, consumer-ready package documentation set.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall: The current dependency set looks intentionally aligned and reasonably fresh for a dev-tooling package. The repository already contains the ADRs and actions that enforce version alignment (notably vitest ↔ @vitest/coverage-v8), and the lockfile/audit run recorded earlier reported zero vulnerabilities. That indicates no known high‑severity issues at the last audit and that the team has taken care to keep test/tooling versions consistent.

- Freshness:
  - Core tooling (TypeScript ^5.9.2, Vitest ^3.2.4, @vitest/coverage-v8 ^3.2.4) is on modern, compatible versions and follows the ADR requiring alignment between vitest and its v8 provider.
  - Dev tooling used for UI testing (jsdom, @testing-library/*, jest-axe) and markdown linting (markdownlint-cli2) are pinned at reasonable recent ranges. Peer ranges in package.json are permissive (^ ranges) while devDependencies include concrete versions used for development.
  - Some libraries (PostCSS / Autoprefixer / Style tooling) are on 8.x / 10.x ranges which are stable long‑running major versions; they are likely up-to-date for the intended compatibility surface.

- Security:
  - The project history shows an npm audit run that reported zero vulnerabilities at the time of the last recorded check. That is a strong positive sign.
  - There is an ADR (supply-chain audit & registry mirror policy) that calls for ongoing auditing and mirrors; that reduces supply‑chain risk when enforced.
  - No obvious risky runtime dependencies are present in this package (it is primarily dev tooling), reducing attack surface. However devDependencies still should be audited periodically since build/test tooling can be vectors.

- Compatibility / Policy compliance:
  - vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 are version-aligned (dev deps show ^3.2.4 for both) — compliant with ADR-0005.
  - PeerDeps list includes vite ^6.0.0 and vitest ^3.2.0 which are compatible with the dev versions selected.
  - TypeScript and @types/node versions are modern and consistent with the repository tsconfig (NodeNext).
  - There is some duplication (packages appear in both peerDependencies and devDependencies as expected for configuration packages) — this is normal per the ADRs and expected for dev-config style packages.

- Risks / Items to monitor:
  - Even though audit reported zero vulnerabilities earlier, dependency vulnerabilities can appear between audits. Recommend running periodic `npm audit` and `npm outdated` (or equivalent) to detect regressions.
  - Keep an eye on PostCSS/autoprefixer compatibility if you upgrade either — PostCSS v8 plugin API stability is good but major upgrades could require verification.
  - Ensure peerDependencies ranges match the versions you intend consumers to install (consider documenting exact compatibility if consumers must use a specific minor/patch).
  - Optional plugin loading (vite-plugin-inline-source) in vite.config.ts is already guarded — good practice for optional dependency handling.

- Recommendation (no action required immediately):
  - Continue the automated audit cadence noted in ADRs and re-run audits after any dependency changes.
  - Before any major upgrades (major-vitest, major-postcss, major-vite), perform a small verification run (type-check/build/tests) as part of the change and bundle with an ADR if the upgrade is a committed change.

Summary: dependencies appear healthy, version-aligned where it matters (notably vitest + coverage provider), and previously audited with zero vulnerabilities. Continue regular audits and monitor major-version upgrades.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall: I find no obvious exploitable application-layer vulnerabilities in the codebase as presented — there are no network servers, no direct runtime evaluation of untrusted input, and the package is a development/tooling library. Static TypeScript utilities, PostCSS config factory, and small test helpers have limited attack surface. The npm audit run reported no vulnerabilities earlier, which reduces short-term dependency risk. However there are several security-relevant observations and recommended mitigations.

Findings and risks
1. History / secret leakage risk (High priority)
   - The project intentionally captures console output into .voder/history.md and other .voder/* artifacts, and these files are tracked/modified in git. That creates a concrete risk of leaking secrets (tokens, credentials, environment dumps, package-install or build logs containing URLs/keys) into the repository. Committing such history to VCS increases blast radius.
   - Recommendation: Treat .voder/history.md as sensitive. Either exclude it from commits, scrub/rotate any secrets in the history, or ensure the project never logs secrets. Add rules/process to scan committed history for secrets (git-secrets or similar) and remove sensitive entries immediately.

2. Execution of third‑party/dev tooling (Medium)
   - The code uses dynamic import of an optional Vite plugin (vite-plugin-inline-source). If that plugin is installed, the plugin's module will be imported and executed at config-load time. Similarly, package scripts (prepare) and test code use child_process.execSync to run npm pack / node, which will execute code (including any package lifecycle scripts of packed packages).
   - Risk: If an attacker can cause an untrusted package to be installed or a malicious plugin to be present in the dev environment, arbitrary code could run during build/test.
   - Recommendation: Limit trusted execution contexts:
     - Only install devDependencies from trusted sources.
     - Avoid importing optional plugins from untrusted sources or document that plugin execution occurs and require explicit opt-in. Consider validating plugin identity (version checksum) before executing.
     - Where possible, avoid shell-based execSync with shell expansion; use child_process.spawn with args (no shell) and validate inputs. In tests, restrict which tarballs/packages are executed.

3. Tests and helper code using execSync (Medium)
   - tests/package-installation.test.ts and related examples use execSync to run `npm pack` and `npm install` in temporary directories, and then execute generated test files with `node`. These are powerful operations that execute arbitrary package code.
   - Recommendation: Ensure CI/test environment is isolated and sandboxed, and avoid running such tests in environments where attacker-controlled package contents could be introduced. Consider running these tests only in trusted CI with hermetic registries / offline caches.

4. Committed build artifacts (informational / minor)
   - There are `dist/` files present in the repo tree (some dist files visible). Committed build outputs can hide compiled code that differs from source and may bypass code review. If those files were produced by a compromised toolchain, they could contain malicious code.
   - Recommendation: Ensure dist/ is gitignored and not committed; review any existing compiled files for consistency with source. Continue to keep dist/ negated in .voderignore for LLM visibility but out of VCS.

5. Dependency maintenance & supply chain (Medium)
   - The project depends on a significant set of devDependencies (vite, vitest, jsdom, markdownlint-cli2, autoprefixer, etc.). Supply-chain attacks or vulnerable versions are a generic risk.
   - Recommendation: Keep dependencies up-to-date, run periodic `npm audit` / SCA scans, pin or exact-match critical tooling where ADRs require alignment (e.g., vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8), and consider lockfile verification in CI. Use a private registry mirror as ADRs recommend.

6. File-system and temp handling (Low)
   - Tests and examples create temporary directories (mkdtemp) and remove them; overall pattern is acceptable. Ensure cleanup always runs (use `finally` or `trap` in scripts) to avoid leaving sensitive temporary files behind.

7. Prettier/TS config & experimental flags (Low)
   - The docs and ADRs recommend running Prettier with NODE_OPTIONS="--experimental-strip-types". Experimental Node flags may change semantics; ensure CI environments are consistent and do not accidentally expose debug information. Not a security bug but operational risk.

Best-practice mitigations (actionable)
- Immediately audit .voder/history.md and other .voder artifacts for any secrets; remove or rotate exposed credentials. Consider removing .voder/history.md from commits or redacting sensitive lines before committing.
- Add a secrets-detection check (pre-commit or CI) to fail builds when high-entropy tokens or common secret patterns appear in committed files.
- Avoid running untrusted code: document that dynamic plugin imports and execSync calls run third-party code and require a trusted dev environment. Restrict or sandbox such operations in CI.
- Use child_process.spawn with args (no shell) instead of execSync where possible to reduce shell injection surface; validate inputs to any spawned command.
- Maintain dependency hygiene: schedule regular audits, pin critical tooling where necessary, and use a registry mirror/trusted registry for CI installs (ADR already recommends this).
- Review any committed dist/ files; remove them from VCS if they are present and ensure .gitignore prevents future commits.

Summary
- No direct application-layer vulnerabilities in the TypeScript source itself; main security concerns are operational: secret leakage via .voder history, execution of third‑party code via dynamic imports and test scripts, and supply-chain risks from devDependencies. Addressing the recommendations above (secret handling, sandboxing/limiting execution of untrusted packages, and dependency auditing) will materially reduce the remaining security risk.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (30% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, publishable state: there are unstaged/modified files in the working tree which must be committed or reverted before the repository can be considered properly managed.
- Git branch synchronization is good: "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'" — there are no unpushed local commits, so remote sync is satisfied.
- File tracking / ignore policies look reasonable (dist/ and other build outputs are in .gitignore and .voderignore negations are present for LLM visibility). There are no reported untracked important files in the git status summary.
- Primary problem: seven modified files (all under .voder/) are listed as changes not staged for commit. Because any uncommitted changes reduce version-control completeness to a maximum of 30%, this is the limiting factor here.

Summary of specifics
- Uncommitted changes: Yes — "modified: .voder/history.md, .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md, .voder/progress-chart.png, .voder/progress-log-areas.csv, .voder/progress-log.csv". This prevents a clean working state.
- Unpushed commits: No — branch is up to date with origin/main.
- Untracked important files: No untracked files reported; file-tracking ratio shows no outstanding untracked project files.
- Build artifacts: dist/ is correctly listed in .gitignore and negated in .voderignore for LLM visibility. If any dist files are accidentally tracked they should be removed from the index; current git status does not indicate tracked dist/ files, but this should be validated before publishing.

Actionable next steps (concise)
1. Decide whether the modified .voder metadata changes should be committed (if they reflect intentional progress) or discarded/stashed. Commit with a clear message if intentional.
2. Run git add/commit (or git restore) to return to a clean working tree.
3. Re-run git status to confirm "nothing to commit, working tree clean" and that branch remains up to date.

Until you commit or clean the modified files, the repository cannot be considered properly version-controlled (hence the 30% assessment).
