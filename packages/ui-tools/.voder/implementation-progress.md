![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (37% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- Summary of completeness:
  - The repository has solid scaffolding: package.json scripts, tsconfig, ADRs, .gitignore/.voderignore, and a minimal public export barrel. Dependency choices look intentional and modern; vitest + coverage provider are version aligned per ADR. Documentation and internal decision records are strong.
  - However the substantive implementation required by the @voder/ui-tools specification is missing or incomplete. Key source modules, tests, lint/config files, templates, and consumer-facing README are absent. Because of those gaps the project cannot be built, tested, or validated end‑to‑end yet.
- Specific findings (by area):
  - FUNCTIONALITY — 20%: Only minimal export barrel present; most requested features (vite factory, vitest jsdom factory, testing helpers, linting config factories, templates) are missing.
  - CODE_QUALITY — 30%: Style choices (explicit .js imports, ESM alignment) are good, but missing files and tests mean the code does not compile or verify; automated lint/format checks are not present.
  - TESTING — 10%: Very limited tests (historical PostCSS test noted) and the mandatory test categories (smoke, package-structure, export-equivalence, installation integration, jsdom/accessibility) are not implemented. Coverage requirements are nowhere near satisfied.
  - EXECUTION — 30%: There was a prior tsc error that was fixed (tsconfig.module alignment), but the full verification pipeline (type-check → build → test) has not been successfully run and validated. A jest-axe peer/dev mismatch was noticed that could break tests.
  - DOCUMENTATION — 55%: Excellent internal docs/ADRs/prompts, but the required consumer README, CHANGELOG, and consolidated API usage docs are missing.
  - DEPENDENCIES — 65%: Declared versions look reasonable and aligned in places (vitest/coverage). One concrete mismatch: peer jest-axe ^9.0.0 vs dev jest-axe ^10.0.0 requires resolution. A full security/freshness verdict requires running npm audit/npm outdated.
  - SECURITY — 60%: No obvious insecure code patterns in committed sources, but supply-chain risk exists (dev tooling, prepare script). Need audit scans and review of lifecycle scripts.
  - VERSION_CONTROL — 25%: Working tree is not clean — 7 modified tracked .voder files are unstaged/uncommitted. Branch is synchronized with remote (no unpushed commits), but uncommitted changes block a clean publishable state.

- Overall synthesis:
  - The project is partially scaffolded and governed by clear ADRs and scripts, but functionally far from complete: core implementation, tests, verification, and consumer docs are missing. The most critical blockers are testing coverage and a clean repository state to enable reliable verification runs.

## NEXT PRIORITY
- Highest priority: get to a reproducible verification run (this addresses Testing, Execution, Functionality, and Version Control).
  1. Clean or commit the .voder metadata changes
     - Decide whether .voder/ edits should be committed. If they are legitimate progress, stage & commit them with an explicit message (they are tracked files). If they are transient, stash or revert them so the working tree is clean. A clean working tree is required to reach a >30% version-control score and to run verification reproducibly.
  2. Run the single verification pipeline and capture console output
     - Run (non-interactive) locally: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test
     - Inspect stdout/stderr, capture results to .voder/history.md (console-first policy will automatically record it).
     - This will surface compile errors, missing modules, and failing tests that must be fixed iteratively.
  3. Triage the first failures (one minimal fix per commit)
     - If missing source modules (e.g., src/build/postcss.ts) are reported as imports not found, add the smallest correct implementation per the spec (start with PostCSS factory because src/index.ts already exports it).
     - If tests fail for version mismatches (e.g., jest-axe), align the devDependency to the peer-compatible range or update peer declaration and create an ADR explaining the change — keep changes minimal and commit with ADR if dependency changes are made.
     - For each fix: git add the changed files, git commit with a concise message, git push origin main, re-run the verification pipeline.
  4. Run supply‑chain snapshot and fix urgent dependency issues
     - npm audit --json --no-fund || true
     - npm outdated --json --no-fund || true
     - Resolve critical/high vulnerabilities before proceeding further; document any dependency changes with ADRs as required.
  5. Add the missing mandatory test suites incrementally
     - Start with tests that validate packaging and exports: tests/package-structure.test.ts and a basic smoke test that imports the built dist index.
     - Then add tests for the PostCSS factory, Vitest jsdom factory (unit), and accessibility helpers (jest-axe), following the spec.
     - Aim to get a green test run first, then incrementally expand coverage toward policy thresholds.
  6. Add consumer README and minimal lint/format config stubs
     - Add README.md in the package root (UNLICENSED, quick start, scripts) so consumers can immediately use the package once built.
     - Add eslint.config.js & prettier.config.js stubs that import from @voder/dev-config to enable lint/format checks.

- Why this order:
  - A clean working tree and a passing verification pipeline are prerequisites for moving forward safely. They will reveal the precise missing pieces (functionality and tests) and let you iterate in small commits as required by the development policy.
  - Resolving dependency mismatches (jest-axe) and running audit/outdated early reduces wasted work chasing flaky or environment-specific failures.

If you want, I can produce an exact step-by-step non‑interactive shell command sequence to run the verification and then propose the minimal code diffs (for example, implement src/build/postcss.ts) to fix the first compile/test errors — or I can start by preparing the minimal PostCSS factory file and a matching unit test as the next incremental change. Which would you prefer?



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (20% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Implemented / Present
  - package.json with sensible scripts (type-check, build, test, test:ci, clean, prepare, voder) and both peerDependencies and devDependencies declared.
  - tsconfig.json configured for NodeNext/ES2022, strict mode, declaration output and includes.
  - docs/decisions ADRs present (several required decisions already authored).
  - Top-level public export barrel (src/index.ts) exists and exposes the PostCSS API symbol expected by the specification.
  - .gitignore and .voderignore follow the repository policies described in the guide.
  - .voder metadata and documentation scaffolding exist and were persisted.

- Missing / Incomplete (critical for functional requirements)
  - Core source modules required by the package are not present (or not visible in the current working tree):
    - The package is specified to expose many features (createViteLibraryConfig, Vitest jsdom factory, testing helpers, accessibility utilities, linting config factories, utils, templates, tests). Those source files (src/build/vite-library.ts, src/build/postcss.ts, src/testing/*, src/linting/*, utils, templates) are not present or not committed in the current project snapshot (only src/index.ts is shown).
    - Even though src/index.ts re-exports createPostCSSConfig from './build/postcss.js', the corresponding TypeScript source (src/build/postcss.ts) is not available in the working tree as listed; without it build and tests will fail.
  - No unit/integration tests present under tests/ in the working tree (the specification mandates extensive Vitest suites and package-structure/export tests).
  - The dual export / packaging strategy (exports pointing to dist/ files, dist generation, and package export tests) is not implemented — package.json lacks exports mapping and there is no dist/ build output committed (dist should be gitignored but visible via .voderignore after building).
  - Template files (templates/vitest.config.ts, vite.config.ts, test-setup.jsdom.ts) are missing.
  - Linting configuration files and scripts mandated by the universal guide (eslint.config.js, prettier.config.js, markdown lint generation scripts and lint:md scripts) are absent.
  - The mandatory README.md (self-contained, UNLICENSED, with usage and security posture) is missing.
  - Tests enforcing dependency/version alignment (e.g., vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8) required by ADRs are not present.
  - Coverage and quality thresholds (90%+ coverage, 100% public API coverage) are not implemented — there is no evidence of test coverage configuration or tests to meet those thresholds.
  - package exports, smoke tests and package-structure tests (required to ensure exports point to dist/) are not implemented.

- Build / Verification readiness
  - Given the missing source files and tests, running the prescribed verification pipeline (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) will fail: the build cannot produce dist/ artifacts when key source modules are absent, and tests are not present to satisfy test scripts / coverage requirements.
  - Some infrastructure pieces (scripts, tsconfig, devDependencies) are configured which helps future work, but the functional surface promised by the implementation guide (Vite config factory, PostCSS factory, Vitest jsdom factory, DOM helpers, accessibility utilities, lint configs, templates, tests, and packaging/export verification) is not implemented.

Overall: the repository contains initial scaffolding (package metadata, TypeScript config, ADRs and a minimal export barrel), but the substantive functionality required by the @voder/ui-tools specification — the majority of source modules, tests, linting hooks, templates, and export/packaging tests — is missing. The project is therefore far from functionally complete.

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (30% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The current codebase is incomplete and not working as-is:
  - src/index.ts re-exports createPostCSSConfig and PostCSSConfigOptions from './build/postcss.js' but there is no corresponding src/build/postcss.(ts|js) file present in the repository snapshot. This unresolved export will break type-checking and compilation (and runtime imports).
  - tsconfig.json includes files (prettier.config.ts) that are not present in the repository snapshot, indicating missing configuration files referenced by the build/test pipeline.
  - The single source file (src/index.ts) uses the ".js" extension in the import path which matches the project's ESM/NodeNext policy — that is correct stylistically — but without the implementation file the pattern is moot.
- Correctness concerns / likely failures:
  - TypeScript compilation will fail because the exported import target is missing; tsc and vitest invocations will therefore error.
  - Unit tests and package-structure tests (per the project spec) are absent or not wired; test coverage and required validation are not satisfied.
- Coding standards and stylistic points:
  - Use of explicit ".js" extension in imports follows the repository’s ESM guidelines — good.
  - The public API surface is minimal and appropriately limited to an export barrel, which aligns with the package patterns.
  - Missing ESLint/Prettier/ESM config files and missing tests mean automated code-quality checks cannot run; repo does not currently demonstrate adherence to the project's required linting and testing standards.
- Maintainability / documentation:
  - There are ADRs and documentation present in docs/, which is good for governance, but the implementation side lacks the expected modules and tests that the docs describe.
  - No JSDoc or inline API docs in the source; adding small comments would help, but this is secondary to restoring missing implementations and tests.
- Summary recommendation (minimal next steps to improve quality):
  1. Add the missing implementation file src/build/postcss.ts (or the compiled JS counterpart) implementing createPostCSSConfig and its types.
  2. Ensure referenced configuration files (e.g., prettier.config.ts) exist or remove them from tsconfig includes.
  3. Add the unit tests promised in the docs (e.g., tests for PostCSS factory) and run the full verification pipeline (type-check → build → test).
  4. Add local ESLint/Prettier configuration stubs (per dev-config) so lint/format checks can run in CI and locally.

Overall, the repository shows a valid design direction and adherence in some stylistic choices, but because key implementation files and tests are missing the code is not currently correct or verifiable — estimate ~30% complete on code quality.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (10% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains a minimal unit test suite (history indicates at least tests/build/postcss.test.ts exercising createPostCSSConfig), and Vitest is configured as the test runner in package.json scripts. However there is no test run output provided here to confirm pass/fail—so I cannot assert the current test run status.
- Coverage and scope: current tests are very limited and cover only a tiny portion of the package surface (PostCSS factory). The required test categories from the Universal Guide (smoke tests, package-structure tests, export-equivalence tests, package-installation integration tests, accessibility/jsdom tests, dependency alignment tests, and broad coverage of public API) are not present or implemented. As a result overall test coverage will be far below the mandated thresholds (90%/100% public API).
- Pass/fail status: Unknown — no console test output was provided. Historical metadata shows a TypeScript compiler error was encountered earlier (TS5110) which was fixed; that suggests tests may not have been run successfully until the tsconfig fix. To confirm pass/fail we must run the test suite (npm test) and inspect console output.
- Gaps to remediate (high priority):
  - Add vitest configuration consistent with UI package expectations (createVitestJsdomConfig) so jsdom tests and coverage run correctly.
  - Implement the mandatory test categories:
    - tests/package-structure.test.ts (verify package.json exports → dist)
    - tests/export-equivalence.test.ts (dual export equivalence)
    - tests/smoke.test.ts (basic imports)
    - tests/package-installation.test.ts (integration via npm pack/install)
    - tests/testing/* (jsdom + jest-axe accessibility tests and helpers)
  - Ensure tests assert dependency/version alignment where ADRs require exact matching (e.g., vitest / @vitest/coverage-v8).
  - Add coverage reporting and thresholds to vitest config; aim to meet the universal policy (90%+ and 100% public API coverage).
- Recommended immediate action to get an authoritative status:
  1. Run the full verification pipeline locally and capture console output: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test
  2. Inspect the test output (stdout/stderr) for failing suites, then iterate minimal fixes and re-run.
  3. After tests are green, run test:ci to confirm coverage and adjust/add tests until thresholds are met.
- Summary verdict: Testing is only scaffolded at present and insufficient to meet the project's mandatory testing requirements. Based on file inspection (without test output), the testing completeness is very low — approximately 10% of what's required (±10%).

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (30% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Not yet successfully validated end‑to‑end: an initial verification run failed with a TypeScript compiler error (TS5110) which was fixed by updating tsconfig.module to "NodeNext" and committed, but there is no evidence the full verification pipeline (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) was re-run and passed. Dev dependencies were installed earlier, but tests/build outcomes are not captured; additionally there is a jest-axe peer/dev version mismatch (peer ^9.0.0 vs dev ^10.0.0) that may cause test failures. Build scripts exist but have not been conclusively verified post-fix — rerun the verify pipeline and supply‑chain checks next.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (55% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains strong internal decision documentation (comprehensive ADRs in docs/decisions/) and detailed implementation guides (prompts/development-ui-tools.md and prompts/universal-guide.md) that thoroughly describe architecture, design principles, and required behaviours. There is also a consumer-oriented usage doc for @voder/dev-config (docs/libraries/usage/voder-dev-config.md) and helpful examples in the prompts and templates directories. These materials provide excellent context for maintainers, design rationale, and intended package scope.

- However, consumer-facing and package-centered documentation is incomplete:
  - There is no package README.md at the repo root / package root for @voder/ui-tools. The README is required (and mandated by the Universal Guide) to be self-contained, include quick‑start, API examples, security posture, and licensing (UNLICENSED).
  - There is no concise API reference documenting the actual exported functions/types implemented in src (e.g., createPostCSSConfig, or the broader testing/linting APIs described in the guides). The main export barrel is minimal and unsupported by generated or hand-written API docs.
  - CHANGELOG.md is missing (the guides expect a CHANGELOG template).
  - The prompts and implementation guides are excellent for maintainers but are internal (in prompts/) and not suitable as published consumer docs. README must not reference these internal files.
  - There is limited documentation of package scripts and how to run the verification pipeline for contributors (scripts are present in package.json but not documented in a README).
  - Example usage is scattered in prompts/templates but not consolidated into a single consumer README with copy‑paste-ready snippets and CLI instructions (including NODE_OPTIONS notes for TypeScript config usage).
  - No documented markdown-lint generation script usage (docs mention it, but there is no top-level README showing how consumers should run lint:md for this package).
  - No API changelog, no published documentation site or generated docs, and no explicit test-run instructions for newcomers beyond scripts.

Recommendation (minimal next steps to reach "adequate" documentation):
1. Add a self-contained README.md in the package root covering purpose, install (dev vs peer deps), quick-start usage examples (build config and testing setup), how to run tests (npm run test, test:ci), scripts reference, security posture, and UNLICENSED notice.
2. Add a short API reference documenting each exported function/type in src (at least the ones currently implemented), with examples.
3. Add CHANGELOG.md (use the provided template).
4. Consolidate runnable examples from templates/ into README and ensure examples are copy‑paste ready (including any NODE_OPTIONS notes).
5. Add a small "Developer Setup" section: how to run verify, build, tests, and lint:md locally.

Overall: excellent internal and governance docs, but missing the essential consumer-facing README, API docs, and changelog that make the package immediately usable and discoverable by developers. Completing the items above would move documentation toward "good" (80–90%).

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (65% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall: Based on the declared versions in package.json (no network queries), the dependency set looks mostly coherent and modern for a 2025-style toolchain (Vitest 3.x, TypeScript 5.x, jsdom 26.x, PostCSS 8.x, Autoprefixer 10.x). However I cannot determine real-time vulnerability status or the latest published versions without running npm audit / npm outdated, so this assessment is necessarily partial.

- Compatibility / alignment highlights:
  - Vitest / coverage provider: devDependencies use vitest ^3.2.4 and @vitest/coverage-v8 ^3.2.4 — these are version-aligned as required by your ADR; this reduces risk of the "Cannot find module '@vitest/coverage-v8'" / peer mismatch problem.
  - jsdom, postcss, autoprefixer: dev versions (jsdom ^26.1.0, postcss ^8.5.6, autoprefixer ^10.4.21) are consistent with the peer ranges in package.json and look compatible with a jsdom/jsdom-based jsdom testing stack and PostCSS + Autoprefixer pipeline.
  - TypeScript: devDependency ^5.9.2 is a recent 5.x line—consistent with the tsconfig targeting NodeNext and using TS features.
  - Vite: listed as a peerDependency ^6.0.0 — ensure your consumers expect that major (I cannot confirm whether v6 is released/stable as of now).
  - @voder/dev-config: declared as a local file dependency ("file:../dev-config") — fine for monorepo development, but note this is not an external registry dependency.

- Notable issues and risks to address:
  1. jest-axe version mismatch: package.json peerDependencies list jest-axe: ^9.0.0 while devDependencies include jest-axe: ^10.0.0. That is an explicit mismatch that may cause consumer/peer compatibility warnings or runtime peer dependency conflicts. Decide either to:
     - Align the devDependency to ^9.x (if you must be compatible with peerConsumers), or
     - Update peerDependencies to ^10.x and record an ADR explaining the breaking/upgrade rationale.
  2. Markdown linting policy vs peer deps: project documentation/ADR expects markdownlint-cli2 to be recognized by packages (often as a peerDependency for documentation linting). This package includes markdownlint-cli2 in devDependencies (dev: ^0.18.1) but it is not declared in peerDependencies. If consumers are expected to run lint:md scripts (and the ADR required peer declarations), consider whether markdownlint-cli2 should be a peerDependency (or document it's development-only).
  3. Peer ranges include Vite ^6.0.0 and Vitest ^3.2.0. If those are forward-looking majors, confirm that the devDependency versions and consumer expectations are aligned; mismatch between declared peer range and installed dev versions can surface during installs.
  4. No runtime dependencies: package.json uses only peerDependencies + devDependencies — appropriate for a tooling/config package, but ensure any consumer-required tools are listed in peerDependencies per ADRs.

- Security / freshness caveats:
  - I cannot assess known vulnerabilities or whether any of those versions have active CVEs without running `npm audit`. A proper security assessment requires:
    - Run: npm audit --json --no-fund
    - Run: npm outdated --json --no-fund
    - Review transitive dependency trees and any high/critical advisories; for dev tooling the impact is lower but still relevant for CI/tooling.
  - Because many tooling packages (ESLint plugins, PostCSS plugins, test frameworks) are actively maintained, minor/patch updates are common — running `npm outdated` will show what can be updated non‑breakingly.

- Recommended next actions (non-interactive, safe):
  1. Run the supply‑chain snapshot and vulnerability scan:
     - npm audit --json --no-fund || true
     - npm outdated --json --no-fund || true
  2. Resolve the jest-axe mismatch:
     - If you need to preserve peer jest-axe ^9.x for consumers, install devDependency jest-axe@^9.0.0 (or change peer to ^10.0.0 and add ADR).
  3. If markdownlint-cli2 is expected by consumers to run markdown lint scripts, decide whether it should be a peerDependency (and create ADR if changing dependency classification).
  4. Pin or align any toolchain packages that have strict peer requirements (Vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8 is already aligned).
  5. After changes, run: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test and re-run audit/outdated to verify.

Summary: dependency selections look reasonable and intentionally modern, but there is at least one concrete version mismatch risk (jest-axe peer vs dev). A full security/freshness verdict requires running `npm audit` and `npm outdated`.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (60% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Surface summary
  - No obvious insecure coding patterns in the committed source files (src/index.ts, src/build/postcss.ts). There are no direct network calls, no usage of eval/new Function, and no writing of non-temp files inside the repository in the source code.
  - Main remaining security exposure is supply‑chain: dependencies and lifecycle scripts (prepare) which can execute arbitrary code during installs. I cannot run dynamic checks (npm audit, static analysis) from here, so this assessment is limited to code/metadata inspection.

- Findings and risks
  1. Supply‑chain / devdependency risk (HIGH):
     - The package relies on many devDependencies (postcss, autoprefixer, vitest, jest-axe, jsdom, markdownlint-cli2, etc.). These are development-only, but devDependencies and prepare scripts run during npm install and can execute code on contributor machines/CI.
     - The package.json has a "prepare" script: "node ../../setup-package-docs.js". prepare runs on npm install for package authors and may execute arbitrary code from the repo hierarchy — this is a legitimate operational need but is a supply‑chain/execution surface that must be reviewed and trusted.
     - Recommendation: run regular npm audit, restrict who can modify scripts, sign or vet setup scripts, and lock/verify transitive dependency integrity (lockfile, provenance).

  2. Lockfile & versioning / vulnerability scanning (MEDIUM):
     - I cannot run `npm audit` here. The repo history mentions dependency installs and lockfile commits; you should run automated supply‑chain scans (npm audit / third‑party SCA) and compare results. The ADRs mention supply-chain policy — implement automated enforcement.
     - Recommendation: run `npm audit --production=false --json` and CI SCA; add lockfile integrity checks in CI.

  3. Execution of shell/child processes in example tests/docs (MEDIUM):
     - The documentation and example test snippets use execSync to run `npm pack`, `npm install`, `node` for package-installation integration tests. If implemented literally in tests, they execute shell commands and external process spawning. Running such tests with unvalidated inputs or untrusted tarballs can be exploited or leak environment.
     - Recommendation: ensure any tests that spawn child processes run only deterministic local artifacts; avoid injecting or executing untrusted code; sanitize inputs and run in ephemeral isolated containers/CI runners.

  4. Plugin/config execution surface (LOW → MEDIUM, context-dependent):
     - createPostCSSConfig merges consumer-supplied plugins into the PostCSS plugin list. If consumers or automation pass untrusted functions/plugins, they can execute code during builds. This is normal for tooling but should be recognized as an execution surface.
     - Recommendation: document expectation that plugin arrays contain trusted implementations; validate/whitelist plugins in high-security contexts.

  5. jest-axe / axe usage (LOW):
     - jest-axe (axe-core) runs DOM analysis; no obvious security problem, but running accessibility checks against untrusted HTML supplied by tests could cause unexpected DOM behavior. No direct vulnerability from using the library itself.
     - Recommendation: treat test inputs as trusted or sanitize sources used in accessibility tests.

  6. JS/TS configuration and experimental flags (LOW):
     - Project documentation references using Node >=22.6.0 and `--experimental-strip-types` for TypeScript Prettier configs. Experimental flags are operational risk (behavior may change), but not a direct security vulnerability. If older Node versions are used inadvertently, tooling may fail in ways that could be exploited in CI pipelines—mitigate by specifying "engines" and gating CI.

  7. Repository hygiene (LOW):
     - .gitignore excludes .env, logs, and other sensitive files. Ensure no secrets are committed (history or accidental). No secrets visible in committed files here.
     - Recommendation: run secret scanning across repo (git-secrets, trufflehog) as part of CI.

  8. Publishing and package.json settings (LOW):
     - package.json "private": true prevents accidental npm publish — good.
     - license UNLICENSED is set — good per policy.

- Concrete actions to reduce risk (prioritized)
  1. Run supply‑chain scans now:
     - npm audit (and address high/critical findings)
     - Snyk/Trivy/OSS-Fuzz or equivalent SCA tool in CI
  2. Review and harden lifecycle scripts:
     - Audit ../../setup-package-docs.js and any scripts run during install (prepare). Limit what they do and require code review for changes.
  3. Lockfile/versions:
     - Keep package-lock.json committed and ensure it is updated only through controlled processes; consider pinning critical tooling versions when ADRs require alignment (e.g., vitest + coverage provider).
  4. Avoid running untrusted child processes in tests; if necessary, run them in isolated temp dirs and CI containers, and validate inputs.
  5. Add an "engines" field to package.json (or document Node requirements) to avoid running with unsupported Node versions.
  6. Add automated tests that verify dependency alignment and lockfile integrity per ADRs.
  7. Secret scanning and pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental commits of credentials.

- Confidence / completeness note
  - This assessment inspects repository metadata, source files, and documentation only; I did not run dynamic tooling (npm audit, static SAST, or runtime tests). Unknowns that would materially change the risk posture include transitive dependency vulnerabilities, contents of ../../setup-package-docs.js, and any CI-only scripts not present here. For those reasons the assessment is partial.

If you want, I can run the verification pipeline and supply‑chain snapshot commands (npm audit, npm outdated) and report exact findings — that will raise the completeness of this assessment significantly.

<scratchpad>
- Git status shows "Changes not staged for commit" with 7 modified files under .voder/.
- Branch is up to date with origin/main -> no unpushed commits.
- File tracking summary: "Total untracked files: 0" — no untracked important files.
- .gitignore exists and seems comprehensive; tracked files count OK.
- Version control completeness requirement: uncommitted changes cause max 30% completeness.
- Therefore final assessment should be <= 30%. Choose 25% ±5% to reflect otherwise-sane state (no unpushed commits, proper ignores) but dirty working tree.
</scratchpad>

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, publishable state: there are tracked, modified files in the working tree that are not staged or committed. This prevents satisfying the "ALL CHANGES COMMITTED" requirement.
- Positives: the local branch is synchronized with origin/main (no unpushed commits), there are no untracked important files, and .gitignore appears to be correctly configured for build/artifact exclusion.
- Problems: 7 tracked files are modified but uncommitted (all under .voder/: .voder/history.md, .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md, .voder/progress-chart.png, .voder/progress-log-areas.csv, .voder/progress-log.csv). Because there are unstaged/unstaged changes, version control completeness is severely limited.
- Summary: With unstaged tracked modifications present (even though commits are pushed and tracking/ignore rules are good), the repo cannot be considered properly managed for release or publishing. Fixing the uncommitted changes (commit, stash, or revert as appropriate) is required to move this toward a clean, synchronized state.
