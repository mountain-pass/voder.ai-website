Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 25.5

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (45% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What’s complete
  - Foundational artifacts and governance: ADRs and decision docs are in place and clear. (DOCUMENTATION: 60%)
  - Minimal implementation: PostCSS factory implemented in src/build/postcss.ts and exported from src/index.ts. The code present is clean, focused, and follows repository ESM/TypeScript conventions (CODE_QUALITY: 82%).
  - Basic TypeScript config and package scripts for type-check/build/test exist in package.json and tsconfig.json.

- What’s missing or incomplete (high‑impact gaps)
  - Core functionality for the package scope is mostly unimplemented: Vite library config factory, testing utilities (vitest/jsdom helpers, accessibility helpers, setup), linting factories, templates, and the expanded export surface are not present. This yields a low FUNCTIONALITY score (20%).
  - Tests are effectively absent and cannot be executed: no committed Vitest tests yet, no devDependencies installed to run tests, and no coverage data (TESTING: 5%). As a result, required verification and mandatory package-structure/export tests are missing.
  - Execution pipeline is not validated: without devDependencies and tests the build/test scripts are not runnable end-to-end (EXECUTION: 15%).
  - Version-control working tree is not clean: there are modified, tracked .voder files unstaged (VERSION_CONTROL: 25%), preventing a clean publishable state.
  - Documentation is strong for internal decisions but missing consumer-facing package README, CHANGELOG, security posture, and some referenced config/template files (DOCUMENTATION: 60%).
  - Dependencies are declared as peers in alignment with ADRs, but dev tooling is not installed/locked; supply-chain audit and alignment (Vitest + coverage provider) must be enforced (DEPENDENCIES: 70%, SECURITY: 80%).

- Specific sub-assessment references
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 20% — only PostCSS factory implemented; most required package features absent.
  - CODE_QUALITY: 82% — implemented code is well-structured and low-risk but lacks tests and stronger typings in places.
  - TESTING: 5% — no runnable tests or coverage; must add tests and install test tooling.
  - EXECUTION: 15% — scripts exist but cannot be validated without installing devDeps and adding tests.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 60% — ADRs good, user-facing README and other consumer docs missing.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 70% — peerDeps look reasonable per ADRs, but devDependencies and lockfile must be installed and audited.
  - SECURITY: 80% — code-level risk is low; main exposure is third‑party dependencies and scripts; ADRs to address supply‑chain are present.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 25% — unstaged tracked changes (.voder files) make the working tree dirty.

## NEXT PRIORITY
(Ordered, small, testable steps — complete each and re-run verification before proceeding)

1. Clean the git working tree (highest short-term blocker)
   - Decide whether to commit or stash the modified .voder metadata.
   - If committing is appropriate:
     - git add .voder/* && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): update .voder metadata" && git push origin main
   - Or stash if the changes are transient:
     - git stash push -- .voder/* --message "wip: local .voder changes"
   - Verify git status is clean after this step (VERSION_CONTROL will move toward 100%).

2. Install and pin the minimal dev toolchain so verification can run
   - Install the dev dependencies per ADR-0005 alignment (non-interactive):
     - npm install --no-audit --no-fund --save-dev typescript vitest@3.2.4 @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4 @types/node postcss autoprefixer @testing-library/dom jest-axe
   - Commit the resulting package-lock.json (or ensure lockfile is present) to ensure reproducible installs (DEPENDENCIES & SECURITY).

3. Add and run the minimal verification test to validate the vertical slice (low-friction test)
   - Add tests/build/postcss.test.ts (the test described in the project plan).
   - Run the three verification commands and iterate on small fixes if needed:
     - npm run type-check
     - npm run build
     - npm test
   - Address only minimal local code/fix changes required to make these pass (no changes to .voder/ or prompts/).

4. Commit verification artifacts
   - git add tests package-lock.json src tsconfig.json || true
   - git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): add PostCSS test, install dev deps, fix type/build issues" || true
   - git push origin main || true
   - After this, TESTING and EXECUTION scores should materially improve.

5. Continue iterative feature work in small steps (each with tests + commit):
   - Implement createViteLibraryConfig and its tests.
   - Add testing utilities (vitest jsdom factory, helpers, accessibility, setup) and unit tests.
   - Add linting config factories and markdown-lint wiring; add mandatory scripts (lint:md, lint:md:fix).
   - Implement package-structure and export-equivalence tests and the package installation integration tests.
   - Add README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and a brief security posture section.

Rationale: address the lowest-scoring, highest-impact areas first — VERSION_CONTROL (clean working tree) and TESTING/EXECUTION (install devDeps and add the PostCSS unit test). These steps will enable automated verification, reveal compatibility or typing issues early, and create a stable foundation for implementing the rest of the package responsibilities.

---

Note: The status remains INCOMPLETE because multiple areas score well below the 95% threshold required for "complete" (notably Testing, Execution, Functionality, and Version Control). Follow the prioritized steps above to incrementally raise those assessments.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (20% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Implemented features (what exists and works in repo):
  - PostCSS configuration factory implemented (src/build/postcss.ts) and exported from the public barrel (src/index.ts). This satisfies the core ADR decision for PostCSS + Autoprefixer at a minimal level.
  - Project metadata and governance artifacts are present: package.json, tsconfig.json, .gitignore, .voderignore, and several ADRs and docs that specify required behaviors and constraints.
  - TypeScript project configuration (tsconfig.json) is in place and set to produce declarations into dist/.
  - Package scripts for basic type-check, build and test are present in package.json (though dev dependencies required to run them are not yet installed in the repo).

- Missing or incomplete features (why requirements are not met):
  - Vite library config factory (src/build/vite-library.ts) is referenced in the spec but not implemented in source. Required API (createViteLibraryConfig) is absent.
  - UI testing stack is largely missing:
    - Vitest jsdom configuration factory (src/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts) is specified in the guide but not present.
    - DOM testing helpers (src/testing/helpers.ts), accessibility utilities (src/testing/accessibility.ts), and test environment setup (src/testing/setup.ts) are not present.
    - No test files exist (the test suite required by the guide — unit tests, export/integration tests, smoke tests, package-structure tests — are absent).
  - Linting configurations and factories (src/linting/html.ts, css.ts, accessibility.ts, and linters/markdown integration) are not implemented.
  - Templates directory (example vitest/vite configs, test-setup) is missing.
  - The package export surface is incomplete: src/index.ts exports only PostCSS factory; the package.json does not declare the dual-export strategy or "exports" field described in the guide (exports pointing to dist/ paths / dedicated paths / prettier, eslint, testing etc. are missing).
  - Build output and packaging infra not implemented:
    - No dist/ artifacts exist (expected), but there are no build helpers/copy:assets scripts described by the universal guide.
    - Tests that validate package.json exports and dist structure (mandatory in the guide) are missing.
  - Mandatory scripts required by the universal guide (verify, lint, lint:fix, format, lint:md, lint:md:fix, prebuild/postbuild, pretest, reset) are not present. The package.json lacks the mandatory markdown lint scripts and many of the recommended/required workflow scripts.
  - Dev dependency installation and alignment per ADRs (vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8 pinned, testing libs, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe, autoprefixer/postcss dev deps) are not present in devDependencies — the only devDependency is a file: reference to @voder/dev-config. That prevents running tests/builds as described.
  - Testing and coverage requirements (vitest configuration, v8 provider alignment, coverage thresholds, 90%+ thresholds) are not implemented or validated.
  - Dual-export equivalence testing, package-installation integration tests, and mandatory package-structure tests are missing.
  - Markdown linting enforcement and .markdownlint.json generation integration (from @voder/dev-config) are not implemented.

- Risk/impact summary:
  - The single implemented piece (PostCSS factory) is useful but very small relative to the package scope. The majority of core package responsibilities (Vite library config, testing utilities, accessibility helpers, linting configs, tests, scripts, packaging/export verification) are unimplemented.
  - Because devDependencies and test suites are not present, the repository cannot currently validate or demonstrate compliance with the documented success criteria (build, tests, coverage thresholds, export verification).
  - The package does not yet meet the mandatory testing, scripting, and export requirements from the Universal Development Guide and the UI tools implementation guide.

- Overall assessment:
  - The project has a correct initial scaffold and strong documentation and ADR coverage, and it includes the PostCSS factory implementation — so foundational work exists.
  - Functionally, however, it is largely incomplete relative to the specified scope. Most requested features and verification mechanisms remain to be implemented and tested.

Recommendation (concise): continue with the planned incremental steps: install the pinned dev dependencies, add the PostCSS unit test (as planned), run type-check/build/tests, then implement the Vite factory, testing utilities and linting configs with their unit/integration tests — validating at each small step.

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (82% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- The code that exists is small, focused, and straightforward. The PostCSS factory implements the intended behavior (returns a plugins array including autoprefixer with sensible defaults) and the export barrel references the factory using the ESM-friendly ".js" extension pattern recommended for TS→ESM builds. There are no obvious logic bugs in the provided source.
- Strengths
  - Clear, single-responsibility implementation for postcss config generation.
  - Uses TypeScript strict mode in tsconfig (good safety posture).
  - ESM import/export patterns follow the repository's ES module conventions (explicit .js extensions in source exports).
- Issues and risks (items to address to improve quality)
  - Weak typing: several places use broad types (plugins: any[]). Explicit return types and stricter interfaces would improve type-safety and documentation of the API surface.
  - Minor API surface completeness: the public index only exports the PostCSS factory; the broader package surface described in the design doc hasn't been implemented yet (that’s expected, but be aware tests and consumers will need the promised exports later).
  - Tests are currently absent for the implemented code (the plan intends to add them). Without unit tests coverage, regressions are easier to introduce.
  - Small stylistic/formatting inconsistencies (e.g., minor leading whitespace/comments formatting in src/index.ts). These are cosmetic but will be picked up by Prettier/ESLint once configured.
  - Reliance on external runtime dev deps: the code assumes autoprefixer (and later test/build tools) will be present. That’s fine when devDeps are installed, but missing installs will block verification runs — not a code bug but an operational dependency to be satisfied.
  - Use of default import for autoprefixer depends on esModuleInterop; tsconfig enables that, but it’s an interoperability surface to be aware of.
- Suggestions (small, incremental improvements)
  - Add explicit return types (e.g., PostCSSConfig type) and tighten plugin typing.
  - Add unit tests for createPostCSSConfig and the export barrel (plan already outlines this).
  - Add lightweight JSDoc comments for public functions to improve maintainability and LLM friendliness.
  - Run Prettier/ESLint (per repo policy) to address formatting and enforce style.
- Overall verdict: the implemented portion is correct and low-risk for typical usage; main quality gaps are lack of tests, some loose typing, and missing broader package pieces per the design. Once the planned tests and lint/format tooling are added and types tightened, code quality will be very good.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (5% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- There are currently no runnable test suites in the repository: the tests/ directory is empty (no committed Vitest test files), and the only source file is a tiny export barrel (src/index.ts).
- package.json includes test scripts (vitest), and tsconfig.json includes "tests" in the include list, but there are no test files or test output captured, so no tests have been executed or recorded.
- Dev tooling required to run tests (vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, typescript, @types/node, testing libraries) are not present in devDependencies — only a file:../dev-config devDependency exists — so even attempting to run tests in the current state would fail.
- Coverage: there is no test coverage data; test coverage goals in the guide (≥90%, 100% for public API) are not met and cannot be measured at present.
- Conclusion: testing is effectively absent. No tests are passing because none exist or can be run; coverage is non-existent.

Recommended next small steps to make progress (minimal, test-first):
1. Add devDependencies (non-interactively) per ADR (typescript, vitest and aligned @vitest/coverage-v8, @types/node, testing libs).
2. Add the minimal PostCSS unit test (tests/build/postcss.test.ts) described in the existing plan and run: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test — iterate until green.
3. Gradually add the required test suites (build, testing utilities, linting config, package structure, export equivalence, package-installation) until coverage targets are met.

But as of now: tests are not implemented and coverage is inadequate.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (15% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains initial source (src/build/postcss.ts and a minimal src/index.ts) and configured npm scripts (type-check, build, test), but the developer toolchain required to run/validate them has not been installed and key runtime/typing dependencies are only declared as peerDependencies. As a result, the build/test pipeline is not currently runnable:
  - TypeScript/tsc will likely fail (missing devDependencies and declaration for imported packages such as autoprefixer; strict mode increases the chance of TS errors).
  - Vitest is not installed, so npm test/test:ci will fail to run.
  - No test files (except planned additions) are present to exercise the test runner.
- Conclusion: the codebase has a partial implementation (work in progress) but has not been executed or validated end-to-end; build and test scripts do not work yet. To progress, install the devDependencies and run the planned verification steps (npm install dev deps → tsc → build → vitest).

<scratchpad>
We need to produce an assessment focusing only on documentation presence/completeness: README, API docs, usage, ADRs, templates, examples, changelog, security posture, test/docs integration.

Inventory from repo:
- No README.md at package root (critical missing for consumers).
- docs/decisions/ contains many ADRs (good).
- docs/decisions/README.md present.
- docs/libraries/usage/voder-dev-config.md exists (good) but it's for dev-config, not ui-tools — still useful/inherited.
- prompts/* contain detailed implementation guides (unpublished internal prompts) — rich internal docs but README rule says README must be user-facing; prompts are internal.
- src/index.ts exports only PostCSS stuff; no API docs specific to ui-tools exports. No generated API reference.
- tsconfig includes prettier.config.ts in include but no prettier.config.ts file present.
- No CHANGELOG.md.
- No SECURITY or README security section for ui-tools.
- docs/decisions for ui-tools include at least 0001 and 0002; good for architectural decisions.
- package.json has description and scripts; but README missing.
- Templates folder referenced in design but not present in repo (templates/ in guide but not in project).
- Mandatory markdown linting rules require .markdownlint.json generated from @voder/dev-config; not present.
- Overall: good internal engineering docs/ADRs + implementation prompts, but lacking consumer-facing README, API reference, usage examples for this package, changelog, security posture, and generated docs.

Score: moderate. I'd put around 60% complete with ±15% to reflect estimation uncertainty.

Recommendations: add README.md (self-contained), API reference (list of exports and types), usage examples for ui-tools (vite/vitest examples), CHANGELOG.md, SECURITY paragraph, generate .markdownlint.json or document how to produce it, include template files referenced or remove references.

Keep concise.

</scratchpad>

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (60% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains strong internal documentation for engineering decisions (comprehensive ADRs in docs/decisions/) and detailed implementation guides/prompts that thoroughly describe intended APIs, patterns, and tests. However, it lacks essential consumer‑facing and package‑level documentation: there is no README.md for @voder/ui-tools, no package API reference or detailed usage examples specific to this package, no CHANGELOG, and no published security posture section. Some referenced artifacts (templates, generated .markdownlint.json, prettier.config.ts) are missing or only described. Actionable next steps: add a self-contained README (installation, quick start, examples), an API summary of exported factories/utilities, a short security posture, a CHANGELOG, and ensure markdown lint generation is documented or the config is committed; keep ADRs and decision docs as-is (they are high quality).

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (70% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Freshness: The package.json currently declares only peerDependencies (vite ^6.0.0, vitest ^3.2.0, jsdom ^26.0.0, jest-axe ^9.0.0, autoprefixer ^10.0.0, postcss ^8.0.0) and a local dev-config devDependency. Those ranges align with the ADRs in the repo (notably the vitest/@vitest coverage alignment policy). On surface inspection the chosen major versions look modern for 2025 (Vitest 3.x, Vite 6, jsdom 26, PostCSS 8/autoprefixer 10), so the declared ranges are plausibly up-to-date with the project's design decisions.

- Security: I cannot verify actual vulnerability status without running npm install + npm audit (or consulting a live vulnerability database). Because only peerDependencies are declared, this package itself does not immediately pull runtime packages into node_modules, which reduces attack surface in packaged output — but consumers will install those peers, so vulnerabilities in those ecosystems could still affect consumers. Given the absence of an audit run, I cannot assert "no significant vulnerabilities"; you should run a non‑interactive audit (npm audit --json) after installing dev dependencies and update or pin transitive dependencies as needed.

- Compatibility risks:
  - ADR-0005 requires exact alignment for vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8. If you add @vitest/coverage-v8 as a devDependency, ensure version parity with vitest (e.g., vitest@3.2.4 + @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4) to avoid runtime "Cannot find module" or peer‑dependency mismatches.
  - postcss/autoprefixer pairing is reasonable (PostCSS 8 + Autoprefixer 10), but some PostCSS plugins or tooling may require PostCSS 8+ vs 9; test your toolchain after installing.
  - Using broad caret ranges (^) is normal, but for tooling with tight peer requirements you may want narrower ranges or exact pins in devDependencies and CI to ensure reproducible builds.

- Recommendations (actions to reach higher confidence):
  1. Install the planned dev toolchain and create/update package-lock.json (per your NEXT plan), then run:
     - npm audit --json (or npm audit) and address high/critical findings.
  2. Concretely pin vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 to matching versions (per ADR-0005) in devDependencies (exact or exact caret aligned versions depending on your policy).
  3. Run the test/build/type-check steps (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) to surface compatibility issues between declared ranges and your code/tests.
  4. Consider adding an automated dependency-audit step (npm audit or SCA) into your verify workflow and keep lockfile updated.
  5. If you need deterministic CI runs, commit a lockfile and adopt strict versions for developer toolchain packages.

Summary: declared dependency choices match the project's ADRs and are plausibly current, but I cannot confirm absence of vulnerabilities without installing and running an audit. Follow the recommended install + audit + alignment steps to raise confidence.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary
  - There are no obvious direct code-level security vulnerabilities in the committed TypeScript source (the current code is small and self-contained: a PostCSS config factory and a minimal export barrel). No use of eval, no network calls, no use of untrusted deserialization, and no obvious XSS sinks in the package code as committed.
  - The dominant security risk area is supply-chain and runtime environment: third‑party dependencies (peerDependencies and expected devDependencies) and any scripts that execute external code. The repository includes ADRs that acknowledge supply-chain concerns (audit & mirror policy and vitest/provider alignment), which is good, but those mitigations must be enforced.

- Specific findings and recommendations (high priority first)
  1. Supply‑chain / dependency risk
     - The package declares several peerDependencies (vite, vitest, jsdom, jest-axe, autoprefixer, postcss). These are external code and represent the largest attack surface (malicious packages, vulnerabilities). Action: run `npm audit` against the lockfile and keep a pinned/verified lockfile; enforce automated supply-chain audits in CI (per ADR-0007).
     - Recommendation: pin or at least tightly constrain critical tooling versions (or use lockfile enforcement) and adopt a process to update them together when needed. Add reproducible installs (lockfile, registry mirror) and automate audit checks.
  2. Missing devDeps / verification gap
     - The repo’s package.json currently only lists `@voder/dev-config` as a devDependency; the plan mentions installing vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, typescript, @types/node, postcss, autoprefixer, etc. If those are missing locally/CI, tests or build scripts may execute unexpected fallback behavior or cause ad-hoc installs. Action: ensure devDependencies are declared and lockfile committed for consistent installs in CI.
  3. Execution of external scripts / execSync risk in tests (planning content)
     - Future test/installation helpers (planned tests in docs) use execSync/npm pack/`node` to run arbitrary commands or temporary consumer code. Running such commands in CI or on developers' machines can execute code from packages or tarballs; this increases risk if inputs are untrusted. When implementing package-installation tests, restrict operations (use offline/local tarballs only), sanitize inputs, and prefer spawning with controlled environment variables and no network where possible.
     - Ensure tests that run external commands do not run as root and fail fast on unexpected outputs.
  4. Scripts referencing sibling workspaces / top-level tooling
     - package.json scripts include `prepare: node ../../setup-package-docs.js` and `voder: node ../../../voder/apps/voder-cli/index.js`. These will run code outside this package when executed. Action: review these referenced scripts to ensure they are safe, do not run network or sensitive operations, and cannot be manipulated by untrusted inputs. Restrict execution in CI to intentional steps.
  5. Config merging and plugin injection surface
     - createPostCSSConfig accepts a plugins array and merges it with autoprefixer. If consumers pass plugin objects from untrusted sources, they may introduce malicious or poorly-coded PostCSS plugins. Recommendation: document expected plugin shape, validate plugin entries where possible, and avoid executing arbitrary code during build/test phases with untrusted inputs.
  6. Test environment and mocking
     - The test setup will mock globals and browser APIs (matchMedia, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver). Ensure mocks are limited in scope (per-test cleanup) and do not inadvertently persist or leak state across tests.
  7. No secrets in repo / .gitignore presence
     - .gitignore is comprehensive and prevents committing typical secret files (.env). Continue to validate pre-commit/githooks or CI checks to detect accidental secrets. Consider adding automated secret scanning in CI.

- Lower-priority / informational items
  - Node engine requirements (some ADRs reference Node >= 22.6.0 for TS config loading). Ensure CI/devs meet that requirement; older Node can cause fallback behavior or tooling misuse.
  - Proprietary license (UNLICENSED) is used; that is not a security control but affects distribution and auditing expectations.
  - .voder metadata files are tracked and contain development metadata. Review those files to ensure they do not contain secrets or credentials (they are currently tracked and modified).

- Recommended next steps (actionable)
  1. Add and commit explicit devDependencies and a lockfile (if not present) so `npm ci` is reproducible. Run `npm audit` and resolve critical/high findings before enabling CI usage.
  2. Implement automated supply-chain audit, lockfile integrity, and registry-mirror enforcement (per ADR-0007).
  3. Review and harden any scripts referenced by package.json (prepare, voder) to ensure they don't perform unsafe actions.
  4. When adding tests that execute external commands (npm pack, node child processes), restrict their execution environment and prefer deterministic local artifacts.
  5. Add automated checks in CI to verify the vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 alignment (ADR-0005) and to fail builds on critical vulnerabilities.
  6. Add secret scanning and pre-commit/CI checks to prevent accidental commits of credentials.

- Final judgment
  - Code-level risk in current committed source is low. The primary security exposure is third-party dependencies and scripts that execute code outside the package. With disciplined dependency management (lockfile + audits), safe scripting practices, and the planned supply-chain mitigations, the package can be maintained with an acceptable security posture.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository is NOT in a clean, publishable state. There are unstaged modified files in the working tree (7 modified files listed), so "ALL CHANGES COMMITTED" is false. Because any uncommitted changes immediately limit completeness, the score is low.
- Branch synchronization is OK: the current branch is "main" and it reports "up to date with 'origin/main'". There are no unpushed commits, so the "ALL COMMITS PUSHED" criterion is satisfied.
- File tracking / ignore rules look appropriate: key build outputs and temp files are covered by .gitignore (dist/, node_modules/, coverage/, etc.) and .voderignore exposes the intended gitignored artifacts to the LLM inspector. There are no untracked important files reported (untracked count = 0), so "PROPER FILE TRACKING" is largely satisfied.
- Clean working state fails due to the unstaged modified files. The modified files are all .voder metadata files (.voder/history.md, .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md, .voder/progress-chart.png, .voder/progress-log-areas.csv, .voder/progress-log.csv). These are tracked files with local modifications that haven't been committed.

Summary of issues:
- Uncommitted changes: yes — prevents a clean state (major deficiency).
- Unpushed commits: no — repository is synchronized with remote.
- Untracked important files: none reported.
- Ignoring of build/artifact files: correct.

Recommended immediate actions to reach a clean, publishable state:
1. Decide whether the .voder metadata changes should be committed. If yes:
   - git add .voder/* && git commit -m "chore: update .voder metadata" && git push origin main
2. If those .voder changes are transient and should not be committed, stash them:
   - git stash push -- .voder/* --message "wip: temp .voder changes"
   - (or use git restore to revert)
3. Verify working tree is clean with git status and re-run verification steps.

Because of the unstaged tracked changes, overall version-control completeness is low despite correct branch sync and ignore config.
