## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (33% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- Current state: a small, correct scaffold exists — the PostCSS factory (createPostCSSConfig) and a minimal export barrel are implemented and a good set of ADRs and governance documentation are present. However the package is far from functional as a shipped or consumable toolkit: most runtime/testing/linting factories, tests, scripts, build outputs, and dev tooling are missing or unvalidated.
- What’s complete
  - PostCSS factory implemented and exported (small, focused working code slice).
  - Governance documentation and ADRs present; .gitignore/.voderignore configured correctly.
  - Code quality for the implemented slice is reasonable (65% assessment).
- What’s missing / blocking
  - No automated tests or test runner configuration (TESTING = 0%). No coverage, no vitest setup, no testable suites.
  - Build & execution are unvalidated: no tsconfig, build pipeline, or compiled dist (EXECUTION = 10%).
  - Major functional features missing: Vite factory, testing utilities, lint config factories, templates, and mandatory package tests (FUNCTIONALITY = 12%).
  - Dev scripts and devDependencies not installed; package.json scripts are minimal (DEPENDENCIES = 45%).
  - Repo not clean or synchronized: unstaged .voder changes and local commits ahead of origin (VERSION_CONTROL = 25%).
  - Documentation for consumers (README, API examples, CHANGELOG) incomplete (DOCUMENTATION = 35%).
  - Security posture is reasonable at code-level but supply‑chain/prepare-script risks remain to be mitigated (SECURITY = 70%).
- Sub-assessment references:
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 12% — only PostCSS factory exported; most features unimplemented.
  - CODE_QUALITY: 65% — implemented code is simple and correct but lacks typings/tests and broader validation.
  - TESTING: 0% — no tests, no test scripts, no coverage.
  - EXECUTION: 10% — build/test scripts are placeholders; no tsc/vitest runs recorded.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 35% — ADRs and guides present; README/API/examples missing.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 45% — peerDeps defined but devDeps & audits not performed; verification needed.
  - SECURITY: 70% — no immediate code vulnerabilities; supply‑chain and install-time scripts require attention.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 25% — unstaged changes and unpushed commits; working tree not clean.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Highest-priority next step (do this first, then iterate):
1. Restore a clean, synchronized git state
   - Stage and commit or stash any intended .voder changes; push local commits so branch is synchronized with origin (resolve the VERSION_CONTROL blockers).
   - Reason: a clean VCS state is required before adding devDeps/tests and ensures reproducible history and ADR bundling.
2. Implement the minimal vertical slice to enable testing and verification (the smallest, verifiable iteration):
   - Add tsconfig.json and minimal package.json scripts (type-check, test, build).
   - Commit the ADR that documents devDependencies (per governance) if you will add them.
   - Install devDependencies required for testing/validation (non-interactive npm install of typescript, vitest, @types/node, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe, postcss, autoprefixer).
   - Add the small unit test for the PostCSS factory (tests/build/postcss.test.ts).
   - Run type-check and vitest to validate; fix issues until green.
   - Commit test files, package.json updates and package-lock changes, then push.
   - Reason: TESTING (0%) is the lowest-scoring area and is a gating requirement for automated verification, exports validation, and subsequent feature work.
3. After tests are green and the repo is clean/pushed, proceed incrementally with the next items in the plan (Vite factory, testing utilities, linting configs, README, build outputs, export tests), validating and committing each small change as you go.

Rationale: Prioritize turning the small working slice into a verifiable, tested package (clean VCS + tests + devDeps). This addresses the lowest-scoring, highest-risk areas (TESTING, VERSION_CONTROL, EXECUTION, FUNCTIONALITY) and enables safe, incremental implementation of the remaining features.

If you’d like, I can perform the next step now (produce the exact non-interactive commands and files for the minimal vertical slice: tsconfig.json, test, package.json script updates, ADR file), run the installs and tests, and report the console output — provided you instruct me to proceed.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (12% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- The implementation is an early scaffold with one useful feature implemented (PostCSS factory) and documentation/decision records present, but it is far from the functional package described in the guides.

What exists (implemented / present)
- PostCSS factory: src/build/postcss.ts implements createPostCSSConfig and is exported from src/index.ts — this satisfies the PostCSS + Autoprefixer requirement partially.
- Public export barrel: a minimal index.ts exists that re-exports createPostCSSConfig (very limited).
- Documentation/ADRs: multiple ADRs and decision docs are present under docs/decisions/, matching governance requirements (good for design but not runtime functionality).
- .gitignore and .voderignore: present and correctly configured per policy.
- package.json: basic metadata and peerDependencies are declared (but devDependencies and scripts are incomplete).
- .voder metadata/history present (operational context).

What is missing (major functional gaps)
- Vite library configuration factory (createViteLibraryConfig) is NOT implemented — required by the design.
- Testing support:
  - Vitest jsdom config factory (createVitestJsdomConfig) is NOT implemented.
  - DOM testing helpers (renderComponent, simulateClick, etc.) are NOT implemented in src/testing/helpers.ts.
  - Accessibility utilities (jest-axe wrappers) are NOT implemented in src/testing/accessibility.ts.
  - Test environment setup (setupJsdomTestEnvironment) is NOT implemented in src/testing/setup.ts.
  - No vitest tests are present in tests/ except the planned ones in the plan (not added).
- Linting configurations:
  - HTML, CSS, and accessibility lint factories (src/linting/*.ts) are not implemented.
- Templates: example vite/vitest/test-setup templates under templates/ are missing.
- Tests & verification:
  - No unit tests were added (the plan included tests; they are not present).
  - No package-structure, export-equivalence, smoke, or installation integration tests exist (mandatory per guide).
- Build and distribution:
  - No tsconfig.json in repository root (plan had one but not applied).
  - No build pipeline (package.json build script is a placeholder).
  - No dual export strategy in package.json (exports pointing at dist/ not present).
  - dist/ directory and compiled outputs are absent.
- Scripts and dev tooling:
  - Required scripts (type-check, test, test:ci, lint, format, lint:md, verify, clean, etc.) are missing or incomplete.
  - DevDependencies required to run tests/type-check/format are not installed (package.json devDependencies only reference @voder/dev-config file path).
  - ADR documenting dev-deps for ui-tools (planned 0002) was not added.
- Policy-specific requirements:
  - Mandatory markdown lint scripts and peer dependency (markdownlint-cli2) not declared.
  - Vitest + coverage provider alignment per ADR-0005 not implemented/tested.
  - Package-structure tests to validate that package.json exports point at ./dist/* are missing.

Risks / Consequences for functionality
- Consumers cannot use this package as described: only a single PostCSS factory is available.
- There is no test harness or CI-style verification, so nothing enforces the quality, coverage, or export rules from the guides.
- The package cannot be built/published (no dist, no build outputs, no exports).
- Many mandated features for UI-focused tooling (jsdom testing, accessibility helpers, linting presets) are unimplemented.

Summary judgement
- The repository contains useful documentation and a correct PostCSS implementation export — that accounts for the small fraction of completion.
- However, most of the functional surface requested by prompts/development-ui-tools.md and the Universal Guide (Vite build factory, testing utilities, linting configs, tests, scripts, build outputs, and dev tooling) are missing.

Recommendation (functional next steps — high level)
- Implement the minimal vertical slice from the existing plan: add tsconfig, unit test for PostCSS, add vitest and typescript devDependencies, configure test scripts, run/green tests, then incrementally implement the remaining factories and tests.
- But note: this is a recommendation only; it is not applied here — assessment focused solely on current functionality.

Overall functional completeness estimate: 12% (±8%).

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (65% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The implemented code is a small, focused vertical slice and is largely correct for its intended purpose: the PostCSS factory exposes a createPostCSSConfig API and the public barrel re-exports it. The PostCSS factory returns a plugins array beginning with an autoprefixer instance (using overrideBrowserslist), which matches the documented intent and is easy to test. The use of explicit .js import extension in src/index.ts follows the project's ESM/TS -> ESM guidance and is consistent with the repository policy.

- Issues and risks:
  - Missing TypeScript project configuration and validation: there is no tsconfig.json present yet, so the code has not been type-checked or compiled here. Without tsc validation we cannot guarantee there are no typing or module-resolution issues when consumers compile the package.
  - Possible runtime interop concern with autoprefixer default import: depending on build/tsconfig flags (esModuleInterop / allowSyntheticDefaultImports) and autoprefixer's package/module shape, a plain `import autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer'` can sometimes result in runtime undefined/default-wrapping issues. This is solvable via tsconfig flags or using `import * as autoprefixer` if needed.
  - Lack of tests and linting: there are no unit tests or linters in place yet for the package code. That means regressions or subtle bugs (e.g., wrong return shape) would go undetected.
  - Minimal typing on returned config: the factory returns an untyped object (plugins: any[]). Stronger types or exported config interfaces would improve consumer experience and catch mistakes earlier.
  - No error handling or input validation: createPostCSSConfig accepts options but does not validate input shapes (not strictly required here, but worth noting for robustness).
  - Minor style/consistency: src/index.ts has leading whitespace, and comments are minimal; overall code is simple but could use small documentation comments for public exports.

- Overall judgement: the core implementation is correct and appropriately simple for the stated goal, but the codebase is incomplete for production quality — it lacks TypeScript configuration, automated tests, and explicit typing/validation. Once tsconfig, type-checking, and a small test suite are added (as planned), code quality will be much stronger.

<scratchpad>
- Inspect project files: package.json has no test scripts (only prepare, voder, build placeholder). devDependencies do not include testing tools. src/index.ts exports createPostCSSConfig; src/build/postcss.ts exists per history.
- No tests directory or test files are present in the current workspace snapshot. The PLAN includes creating tests, but they haven't been applied.
- No test output was provided; git status shows only .voder metadata modified.
- Conclusion: There are no automated tests configured or runnable right now. Coverage is effectively 0%.
- Next steps: add dev deps (vitest, @types/node, etc.), add test scripts, create tests (e.g., tests/build/postcss.test.ts), run tests and coverage, and iterate until coverage thresholds are met.
</scratchpad>

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (0% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- There are currently no formal test suites or test runner configuration in the repository: no Vitest/Jest configuration files, no test scripts in package.json, and no committed tests under tests/. As a result, no tests have been run and none are passing.
- Test coverage is effectively 0% (no tests exist to measure coverage).
- The project plan includes adding unit tests, test scripts, and devDependencies (Vitest, types, etc.), but those steps have not yet been implemented or validated.
- Recommendation (next immediate actions):
  1. Add the ADR and install devDependencies (vitest, typescript, @types/node, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe, etc.) as planned.
  2. Add minimal scripts to package.json ("test", "test:watch", "test:ci", "type-check").
  3. Commit a small unit test (e.g., tests/build/postcss.test.ts) and run vitest to validate.
  4. Add coverage configuration and aim to incrementally reach the required thresholds.
- Until the above are implemented and the test suite executed, testing status is incomplete and unverified.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (10% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The package has not been run or validated end-to-end. There is source for the PostCSS factory and a minimal export barrel, but no successful build/test/type-check evidence: package.json's "build" is a placeholder ("echo 'Build placeholder'"), there is no tsconfig.json, no test/type-check scripts were executed, no devDependencies were installed, and there are no compiled outputs in dist/. Console/history files show metadata commits, but no tsc/vitest/npm-run outputs were recorded. In short: implementation work exists, but nothing has been executed or validated — build scripts do not produce real artifacts yet.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (35% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains high‑quality, policy-level documentation (prompts/universal-guide.md and prompts/development-ui-tools.md) and several ADRs under docs/decisions that clearly record architectural decisions — these are strong foundations. However, package‑level consumer and developer documentation is incomplete. Missing or weak areas include: no package README.md in the package root (public, self-contained README required), no API reference for the exported functions/types (src/index.ts only has a minimal barrel), no usage examples or quick‑start README for @voder/ui-tools (the repo includes a dev‑config usage doc but not ui‑tools), no CHANGELOG, no documented package scripts and developer workflow in package README, and no generated markdownlint config/instruction placed where consumers expect it. Tests, templates, and examples mentioned in the implementation guide are described but not present in repository docs (templates/ and tests/ directories are referenced in guides but not populated). ADRs are present (good), but the planned ADR to record dev dependencies is only in the plan and not yet committed.

Recommendations (next doc work, prioritized):
1. Add a self‑contained README.md at package root covering purpose, compatibility (Node engine), install (how consumers add it), quick start examples (vite/vitest usage), security posture, and license notice — avoid internal repo links per policy.
2. Add an API reference (short docs or docs/api.md) documenting each exported factory and utility (createViteLibraryConfig, createPostCSSConfig, createVitestJsdomConfig, renderComponent, accessibility helpers, lint config factories).
3. Add usage examples and templates into templates/ (or document their absence), and surface example snippets in README.
4. Add CHANGELOG.md (using template), and a CONTRIBUTING or Development section describing scripts (type-check, test, build) and ADR process.
5. Ensure markdown lint setup instructions (generate .markdownlint.json from @voder/dev-config) are present in README or docs and include required scripts in package.json.
6. Commit the planned ADR for dev deps and document any required peerDependencies and engine constraints (Node >=22.6.0) in README.

Overall: good architectural and governance docs exist, but consumer/developer facing documentation (README, API, examples, CHANGELOG) is largely missing — address these first to reach a usable, discoverable package.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (45% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Summary: Based on the contents of package.json alone (peerDependencies listed, a single local devDependency @voder/dev-config), I can only perform a partial, offline assessment. Because these are primarily peerDependencies (not installed in this package), I cannot determine known security advisories or transitive vulnerability exposure without running an audit against an installed dependency tree. The assessment below therefore highlights risk areas, compatibility notes, and recommended verification steps rather than definitive vulnerability findings.

- Freshness / versioning:
  - The package declares peerDependencies with caret ranges (e.g., "vite": "^6.0.0", "vitest": "^3.2.0", "postcss": "^8.0.0", "autoprefixer": "^10.0.0"). Using caret ranges is reasonable for allowing non-breaking minor/patch updates, but it also means the exact installed versions depend on the consumer's environment and lockfile.
  - Some declared major minimums (e.g., vite ^6.0.0) may be ahead of stable releases known earlier; if those minima are greater than what the ecosystem commonly uses, consumers could face version skew. Confirm that the declared minima match tested versions.
  - Autoprefixer ^10 and PostCSS ^8 are historically common and broadly compatible with Vite setups; however newer major releases may exist — verify compatibility if you plan to accept newer versions in consumers.

- Security vulnerabilities:
  - Cannot assert absence/presence of vulnerabilities from package.json alone. Because these are peerDependencies, this package will not install them and thus will not surface vulnerabilities via a local npm audit for this package unless you install them as devDependencies for testing.
  - Risk: If consumers install incompatible or vulnerable versions, they may be exposed. The project’s ADRs already require supply-chain audit practices (ADR-0007). Run `npm audit` (or SCA tooling) in a real install context (e.g., a temporary consumer project or after adding devDependencies for verification).
  - Recommendation: As part of verification, install the declared peerDependency versions (or the highest compatible versions you intend to support) in a disposable environment and run `npm audit` and SCA scanners.

- Compatibility concerns:
  - Vitest and its coverage provider historically require tight version alignment (noted in ADR-0005). If you later add `@vitest/coverage-v8`, ensure you align versions exactly (or add tests that assert version alignment).
  - jsdom, jest-axe, and testing libs are listed as peerDependencies; ensure tests run in your dev environment by adding matching devDependencies (per ADR-0001). Without those devDependencies present locally, you can’t validate APIs or detect incompatibilities.
  - Because package.json sets "type":"module" and other ADRs recommend TypeScript configs and .ts export points for some configs, ensure Node engine constraints (Node >=22.6.0 per inherited ADRs) are communicated via "engines" if required.

- Policy / governance alignment:
  - The repo’s ADRs require documenting new direct dependencies. Any addition of direct devDependencies (e.g., vitest, typescript, @vitest/coverage-v8) must be accompanied by ADR(s). That helps track version-alignment decisions and security rationale.
  - The package currently lists only peerDependencies and a local devDependency; for local verification and audit you should add the necessary devDependencies (per the planned steps) and then run audits.

- Practical risk level (given current info):
  - Moderate: peerDependencies look reasonable for a UI tooling package, but because we cannot run an audit or inspect resolved versions, residual risk remains (unverified transitive vulnerabilities, possible mismatches between declared minima and actual environment versions).

- Recommended next verification steps (concise):
  1. In a safe, temporary/dev environment, install the intended devDependency set (typescript, vitest, @types/node, postcss, autoprefixer, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe, and optionally @vitest/coverage-v8 aligned to vitest) and run:
     - npm audit
     - npm run test (once tests added)
  2. If adding @vitest/coverage-v8, pin it to the exact vitest-compatible version per ADR-0005 (or add automated tests to assert version alignment).
  3. Regularly run SCA tooling in CI (per ADR-0007) and keep caret ranges under review; consider pinning or using lockfile maintenance if you require deterministic installs.
  4. If you need an immediate security posture statement, add those verification devDependencies and run `npm audit` — that will give a concrete vulnerability list to act on.

- Conclusion: From package.json alone I cannot guarantee there are no significant vulnerabilities. The declared peerDependencies and ranges are plausible but unverified; run an install+audit (or add the devDependencies temporarily for local verification) to complete a thorough security assessment.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (70% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary
  - The current code and repository layout show a low-to-moderate immediate security risk surface for typical library code: there is no network I/O, no runtime credential handling, and most potentially risky tools are declared as peer/dev dependencies rather than bundled. However, there are supply‑chain and operational risks that should be addressed to harden the package before wider consumption.

- Supply‑chain risks
  - Peer/dev dependency surface is significant (vite, vitest, jsdom, jest-axe, postcss, autoprefixer, etc.). These are not bundled here but are consumers'/developers' responsibility — that reduces runtime risk but exposes the build/test process to upstream dependency compromise.
  - package.json uses caret ranges for peer deps (broad ranges). That increases exposure to malicious or vulnerable updates pulled in later. ADRs discuss version alignment for some packages (vitest + coverage) — follow those ADRs where exact alignment is required.
  - Dev dependency currently points to a local path ("@voder/dev-config": "file:../dev-config"). In a monorepo this is common, but it means installs rely on local content; ensure that local packages are reviewed and do not execute unsafe install scripts.

- Install-time / lifecycle script risk
  - package.json includes lifecycle/script entries (prepare, voder) that execute local Node scripts (node ../../setup-package-docs.js, node ../../../voder/apps/voder-cli/index.js). Prepare runs automatically on npm install — executing arbitrary code during install is a common vector for supply‑chain attacks. Ensure these scripts are trusted, minimal, and audited. Consider avoiding prepare scripts that execute non-idempotent or networked actions.
  - The project previously had logic to alter prepare to a no-op conditionally; prefer explicit, audited install-time behavior rather than hidden/conditional scripts.

- Local execSync / shell usage in tests/documentation
  - Several example/integration tests in the guide use execSync to run npm, node, and shell commands. If such patterns are used in committed test code, be careful to avoid passing untrusted input to execSync (shell injection). Use direct programmatic APIs or spawn with arrays & { shell: false } where possible and sanitize inputs.

- Missing hardening / policies
  - No "engines" field is present (package.json) to require a minimum Node version (the documentation expects Node ≥22.6.0). This can lead to unexpected runtime behavior on older Node versions; it also makes it easier for contributors/CI to run in inconsistent environments with differing security patches.
  - No explicit automated SCA or audit configuration is present in package.json scripts (verify steps are recommended in docs but not implemented in package.json currently). Relying on manual audit is weaker than CI-enforced SCA.
  - No explicit lockfile handling/verification guidance in the package. Ensure a lockfile (package-lock.json or pnpm-lock) is committed for reproducible installs in CI and audited for integrity.

- Code-level surface
  - createPostCSSConfig and other config factory functions accept plugin arrays/override objects. While this is correct for flexibility, treat any user-provided plugin list as untrusted input — avoid evaluating or executing strings from config, and validate/sanitize plugin selections where code executes them.
  - Accessibility/test helpers include global expect extensions (expect.extend) and global mocks. These are test-time only and not a vulnerability in production code, but be mindful they change runtime test behavior — avoid running tests in privileged environments or with production data.

- Sensitive data & repo hygiene
  - .gitignore includes .env and other patterns; this is good. But there is no automated secret-scanning step indicated. Add a scan for accidental secrets in commits/history before publishing artifacts.
  - The repo is private and package.json has "private": true, limiting accidental public publication — this is a helpful mitigation.

- Recommendations / mitigations
  - Constrain version ranges for critical dev tools (or pin exact versions where ADRs require alignment) to reduce the risk of malicious/misbehaving upstream releases; use ADRs to document exact pins where needed.
  - Avoid or strictly audit any install-time lifecycle scripts (prepare). If prepare is required, minimize what it does, and document/trust its code path. Consider moving non-essential steps to explicit developer commands.
  - Add an "engines" field to package.json and document the required Node version (e.g., "node": ">=22.6.0") to ensure consistent, patched runtimes.
  - Commit and maintain a lockfile and enable automated dependency scanning (npm audit / Snyk / Dependabot) in CI according to ADR-0007.
  - If tests use execSync or spawn, ensure they do not interpolate untrusted inputs into shell commands. Prefer programmatic APIs or sanitized arguments.
  - Add a simple pre-flight SCA script in verify (or CI) and make sure npm audit is part of the standard pipeline (but be cautious with `npm audit fix --force` — understand its effects).
  - Perform secret scanning of repo history and enforce .gitignore coverage checks before commits (as docs recommend).
  - Validate any external scripts referenced by package.json (../../setup-package-docs.js, voder CLI) so they do not perform unexpected network or filesystem operations during installs.

- Overall assessment
  - No obvious direct code vulnerabilities (no network access, no credential handling, no unsafe evals) in the committed source files. Primary risks are supply-chain (dependency updates), install-time script execution, and build/test-time command execution patterns. Addressing the recommendations above will significantly reduce the risk profile.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, synchronized state: there are unstaged/uncommitted working-tree changes and local commits that have not been pushed. For version-control completeness we expect a clean working tree (no modified files), and all local commits pushed to the remote — neither condition is satisfied.
- Specific findings:
  - Uncommitted changes: git status shows modified (unstaged) files under .voder: .voder/history.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md. Any unstaged/modified files mean the working tree is not fully committed (this alone limits completeness heavily).
  - Unpushed commits: branch is ahead of origin/main by 2 commits (local commits not pushed). That means local history is not synchronized with remote.
  - File tracking / ignore policy: .gitignore appears comprehensive (node_modules/, dist/, logs, etc. are ignored) and there are no important untracked files reported (untracked files = 0). That is good. .voderignore includes negations for LLM visibility as intended.
  - Cleanliness: because there are both uncommitted changes and unpushed commits the repository is not in a publishable state.
  
Overall: version control is partially configured correctly (good .gitignore, tracked important files, no untracked important files), but the current working state fails the two critical requirements (all changes committed; all commits pushed). This yields a low completeness score (≈25%).
