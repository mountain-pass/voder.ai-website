# @voder/ui-tools Implementation Progress Assessment

**Assessment Date:** 2 September 2025  
**Project Version:** 1.0.0  
**Assessment Scope:** Based on history.md, plan.md, prompts/, and docs/

3. **Build Process Broken** - Cannot produce distributable package
4. **Test Suite Non-functional** - Cannot verify any functionality

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Implement all missing TypeScript interfaces and type definitions
2. Fix ESLint configuration (missing tsconfig.build.json)
3. Resolve all TypeScript compilation errors
4. Complete build process to generate dist output
5. Verify test suite execution
6. Address security vulnerabilities

**Project State:** 
- **Functional:** ❌ Not operational
- **Buildable:** ❌ Cannot build
- **Testable:** ❌ Cannot test
- **Distributable:** ❌ No package output
- **Ready for Use:** ❌ Not ready

**Estimated Work Required:** 2-3 days of focused development to reach minimum viable state

**Priority Ranking:**
1. **CRITICAL:** Fix TypeScript compilation (blocks everything)
2. **HIGH:** Implement missing type definitions
3. **HIGH:** Restore build and test functionality
4. **MEDIUM:** Address security vulnerabilities
5. **LOW:** Documentation enhancements

The project has a solid foundation and excellent documentation, but critical implementation gaps prevent it from being functional. The architecture and design are sound, requiring focused effort on type safety and compilation issues to achieve operational status.
