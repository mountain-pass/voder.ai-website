Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (71% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- Summary of what's complete:
  - Core, high-value pieces are implemented and tested:
    - PostCSS factory (createPostCSSConfig) — implemented and unit-tested (Functionality area).
    - Vite library config factory (createViteLibraryConfig) — implemented, merges PostCSS, ESM-only builds, unit-tested.
    - Public export barrel exposes the main factories and smoke tests exercise it.
    - Testing helpers (renderComponent, simulateClick, waitForNextFrame, waitForAnimation) and jsdom environment setup exist with unit tests.
    - ADRs and a thorough README and decision documentation are present.
  - Build/test infrastructure exists (tsconfig, vitest scripts) and prior verification runs completed successfully at points in history.

- What’s missing or broken (high-level):
  - Missing required features from the specification:
    - No createVitestJsdomConfig factory implemented.
    - Accessibility testing utilities (jest-axe helpers) are not implemented.
    - Linting configuration factories (html/css/accessibility) are not implemented.
    - Example templates (templates/) are missing.
    - Standardized package scripts required by the universal guide (lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix, verify) are absent.
    - Dual/dedicated package exports (./testing, ./prettier, etc.) not present in package.json.
    - Integration tests (export-equivalence, package-installation) are not present.
  - Defects and issues identified:
    - renderComponent unmount logic currently always removes the container even when caller-owned (CODE_QUALITY: 72%).
    - renderComponent swallows mount/unmount errors silently (should console.error per console‑first policy).
    - Test import-extension inconsistencies (.ts extensions in test imports) caused TypeScript TS5097 failures that broke the latest verification run (TESTING / EXECUTION instability).
  - Version control state is not clean: unstaged modified file(s) and local commits ahead of origin/main (VERSION_CONTROL is the lowest-scoring area, see below).

- Reference to individual assessment findings:
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 65% — Core factories and helpers implemented, several required modules and integration tests still missing.
  - CODE_QUALITY: 72% — Code is readable and modular; some functional bugs (renderComponent ownership and swallowed errors) and loose typings need fixes.
  - TESTING: 50% — Unit tests exist for implemented pieces, but verification is unstable due to TS import-extension errors and many required test suites are missing; coverage is far below the 90% target.
  - EXECUTION: 80% — Builds and tests have run successfully in prior iterations, but current working tree fails the end-to-end verify because of TypeScript import issues and uncommitted changes.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 78% — README and ADRs are comprehensive; missing API reference snippets and templates to fully satisfy the spec.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 75% — Versions look modern and aligned (notably vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 alignment). Security audit and transitive dependency checks still required.
  - SECURITY: 80% — No immediate code-level critical vulnerabilities; supply-chain and lifecycle scripts are the primary risks and should be audited.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 25% — Working tree has modified file(s) and local commits ahead of remote; repository is not clean nor fully synchronized.

## NEXT PRIORITY
The highest priority is to get the repository into a clean, verifiable, reproducible state and then fix the single most impactful test/build error. Based on the assessments the immediate actions are:

1) Clean up version control (CRITICAL — addresses VERSION_CONTROL 25%)
   - Stage and commit outstanding working copy changes (the immediate unstaged modified file is tests/testing/helpers.test.ts per git status).
     - Example: git add tests/testing/helpers.test.ts && git commit -m "test: remove .ts extension from imports in helpers test"
   - Push local commits to the remote: git push origin main
   - Rationale: Uncommitted and unpushed changes block reliable verification and collaboration; Version Control cleanliness is a prerequisite for running repeatable verification.

2) Run the verification pipeline immediately after pushing
   - npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test
   - Inspect the console/stderr and identify the first failing error. The history indicates the likely first failure will be TS5097 import-extension errors in tests (e.g., tests/testing/setup.test.ts). But commit/push + a fresh verify is required to confirm the first failing item in the current tree.

3) Fix the first failing issue (single-file-per-commit rule)
   - If the first failure is TS5097 (import path ending with ".ts"):
     - Edit tests/testing/setup.test.ts: change import '../../src/testing/setup.ts' → import '../../src/testing/setup'
     - git add, commit (message: "test: remove .ts extension from imports in setup test"), push, re-run verify.
   - If the first failure is a test assertion related to renderComponent lifecycle:
     - Edit src/testing/helpers.ts with these precise changes (single-file):
       - Track a createdByHelper boolean indicating whether the helper created/attached the container.
       - Only append container to document.body when the helper created it.
       - Only remove container on unmount when createdByHelper is true.
       - Replace silent catches around mount/unmount with console.error(...) so errors are emitted to stderr.
     - git add, commit (message: "fix: renderComponent only removes created container and log mount/unmount errors"), push, re-run verify.
   - Always re-run the verification pipeline and iterate on the first failure until it passes.

4) After the verify loop is green, work down the highest functionality gaps iteratively (one-file-per-commit):
   - Implement src/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts and unit tests.
   - Implement src/testing/accessibility.ts (jest-axe helpers) and tests.
   - Add linting factory modules under src/linting/ and corresponding tests.
   - Add standardized package scripts (lint, format, lint:md, verify) to package.json.
   - Add dedicated export paths in package.json (./testing, ./prettier, etc.) and add export-equivalence and package-installation integration tests.
   - Gradually expand test coverage toward the 90% target.

Why these steps:
- Version control cleanliness is blocking (uncommitted/unpushed changes) and must be resolved first.
- Getting a green verify run identifies the current first failure and enables the single-file reactive loop that the repository/process expects.
- Fixing the renderComponent ownership and error‑visibility issues addresses a functional and code-quality problem that will improve test reliability and observability.
- Implementing missing factories and tests closes the functional and coverage gaps identified in the Functionality and Testing assessments.

If you want, I can:
- Produce the exact git commands and the focused code patch for renderComponent (one-file change) and/or the tests import fixes, and then run the verify loop in the incremental way described.
- Or, I can proceed to implement the next missing factory (createVitestJsdomConfig) as the next one-file change after version-control fixes.

Which immediate action would you like me to take now? (commit/push the test import fix, patch renderComponent, run verify, or implement one of the missing factories)



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (65% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The implementation covers many core foundations but several required features from the @voder/ui-tools specification remain missing.

What is implemented (major items)
- PostCSS configuration factory
  - createPostCSSConfig implemented in src/build/postcss.ts and compiled artifact exists in dist. Tests cover that it returns a plugins array with at least one plugin.
- Vite library configuration factory
  - createViteLibraryConfig implemented in src/build/vite-library.ts, merges PostCSS, supports external, extractCSS, sourcemaps, ESM-only formats. Unit tests exercise format/name and verify postcss is present.
- Public export barrel
  - src/index.ts exports the two main factories (createPostCSSConfig and createViteLibraryConfig) and the dist compiled barrel exists and is used in smoke tests.
- Component test helpers & jsdom setup
  - renderComponent, simulateClick, waitForNextFrame, waitForAnimation implemented (src/testing/helpers.ts) and have unit tests.
  - setupJsdomTestEnvironment implemented (src/testing/setup.ts) with DOM cleanup and mocks; basic test confirms it doesn't throw.
- Package structure & smoke tests
  - Vitest tests exist that validate package.json exports point to dist paths, smoke tests import source barrel, and there are unit tests for the build factories and testing helpers.
- ADRs and documentation
  - Decision records and README are present and align with many policy requirements (e.g., PostCSS+autoprefixer ADR).

What is missing or incomplete (functionality gaps vs. the spec)
- Vitest jsdom config factory
  - The guide requires createVitestJsdomConfig (src/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts). That file is not present in src. The tests and docs reference it, but the actual factory implementation is missing.
- Accessibility testing utilities
  - The spec requires jest-axe integration and helpers (expectAccessible, getAccessibilityViolations, accessibilityTests, expectAriaAttributes, expectFocusable). There is no src/testing/accessibility.ts implementation in the source tree (dist does not contain these testing exports either). Tests that exercise axe behavior in the guide are not present.
- Linting configuration factories
  - The package spec calls for src/linting/html.ts, css.ts, accessibility.ts factories. Those files are not present in src.
- Template files
  - templates/vitest.config.ts, vite.config.ts, test-setup.jsdom.ts are not present in the repository.
- Required standardized npm scripts
  - package.json contains core scripts (type-check, build, test, test:ci, clean, prepare, voder, pretest) but lacks many of the mandatory/standardized scripts demanded by the universal guide (lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix, verify). The verify script (comprehensive quality gate) is not implemented.
- Markdown lint generation and enforcement
  - The docs require generation of .markdownlint.json via @voder/dev-config helper and lint:md scripts; this infrastructure is not present in scripts.
- Coverage/quality thresholds & tests
  - The guide expects a comprehensive test suite (including vitest configuration factory, package-installation integration tests, export-equivalence, and package-structure tests). While package-structure and several unit tests exist, the suite is incomplete (no installation/integration tests, no export-equivalence tests).
- Policy-driven constraints not fully enforced
  - The universal guide mandates certain exports (dual export strategy) and additional public exports (./testing, ./prettier, ./eslint, etc.) for configuration packages. package.json exports are minimal (only ".": "./dist/src/index.js"). Dual/dedicated export paths are not present.
- Coverage targets and public API coverage
  - The repository does not yet demonstrate meeting the 90%+ coverage expectations or 100% public API coverage. Tests cover core helpers and factories but not the full API surface described in the guide.
- Minor test/TS hygiene observed in history
  - There were TS import-extension issues (tests imported .ts extensions), which required fixes; while those were addressed in prior edits, they indicate fragile areas that need consistent vetting (tsconfig flags and test imports).

Summary judgment
- Core value propositions are present: PostCSS factory, Vite library config factory, component test helpers, and a working set of unit tests covering those areas. These are the highest-value pieces for UI tooling and are correctly implemented and tested.
- However, several feature areas explicitly required by the specification are not implemented: Vitest jsdom factory, accessibility helpers (jest-axe), linting configuration factories, templates, standardized scripts (lint, format, verify, markdown lint), dual export strategy, and integration tests for package exports/installation. Until those are implemented and tested, the package does not fully satisfy the documented requirements for @voder/ui-tools.

Recommended immediate next steps (to close gaps)
- Implement src/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts (createVitestJsdomConfig) and add unit tests to exercise coverage thresholds and jsdom settings.
- Implement src/testing/accessibility.ts using jest-axe and add tests (e.g., color-contrast detection example).
- Add linting factory modules (src/linting/*) and unit tests.
- Add the required package scripts (lint, format, lint:md, verify) consistent with the universal guide.
- Add export entries in package.json for dedicated import paths if the package needs to support them and add the export-equivalence and package-installation integration tests.

Overall completeness estimate: 65% ±15% — good foundational work done, but several mandatory capabilities and enforcement scripts/tests still need to be implemented to meet the full specification.

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (72% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- The codebase is generally well-structured, readable, and follows many of the project's ESM/TypeScript conventions (NodeNext module resolution, explicit .js import paths in sources, small focused files and factories, good doc comments). The implementation of the PostCSS and Vite config factories is clear and appears correct. Test helpers and jsdom setup are thoughtfully designed for the proposed testing model.

- Issues / bugs / correctness problems:
  1. renderComponent ownership bug — src/testing/helpers.ts always removes the container on unmount regardless of whether the container was created/owned by the helper or supplied by the caller. This violates intended behavior and will break tests that expect caller-owned containers to remain in the document.
  2. Silent error swallowing — renderComponent currently swallows exceptions from mount/unmount without reporting them. This hides useful diagnostics; per the project's console-first policy such errors should be surfaced to stderr (console.error) so test failures and debugging info are visible.
  3. Inconsistent import extensions in tests — some test files import source modules with a trailing ".ts" extension (e.g., tests/testing/setup.test.ts), which triggers TypeScript TS5097 unless compiler options allow importing .ts extensions. Other tests correctly use .js-less or .js extensions. This inconsistency leads to type-check/build failures.
  4. Minor typing looseness — mergedPostcss is typed as Record<string, unknown> and several casts to any are used. Not a critical bug, but could be tightened for better type safety.
  5. Use of global assignment for test environment mocks (global.IntersectionObserver, global.ResizeObserver) requires @ts-ignore; this is acceptable in test environment code but should be explicit about typing to avoid TS noise.
  6. Some tests and helpers hide or swallow failures instead of emitting structured console output; this reduces observability and violates the repository's console-first diagnostic guidance.

- Coding standards / maintainability:
  - Positive: files are small and focused, names are meaningful, doc comments present, project conventions (exports, ESM imports) are followed.
  - Improvement areas: prefer surfacing errors (console.error) instead of silent catches, tighten types for merged PostCSS config, and make test import paths consistent (use .js imports for ESM targets or remove explicit extensions where allowed and configured).

- Overall recommendation (next small fixes):
  1. Fix src/testing/helpers.ts to track whether the helper created/attached the container and only remove it on unmount when appropriate; change swallowed catches to console.error so diagnostics appear in stderr.
  2. Normalize test imports to remove `.ts` extensions (or consistently use `.js` where needed) to eliminate TS5097 errors.
  3. Optionally strengthen types around PostCSS merging to avoid any casts where possible.

Given the number and severity of the issues (one functional test-breaking bug and a small set of TypeScript/test configuration inconsistencies), the code is good but not yet fully correct — hence the 72% score with moderate uncertainty.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (≈50% ±15% COMPLETE)
- There is a reasonable baseline of formal Vitest tests that exercise core, high-value code paths:
  - Unit tests for PostCSS config (createPostCSSConfig) and Vite library config (createViteLibraryConfig).
  - Smoke test that imports the package entry.
  - Tests for the testing helpers (renderComponent, simulateClick, waitForNextFrame/Animation).
  - A package-structure test that validates package.json export paths point to files under dist/.
  - A small jsdom setup test that asserts the environment setup function does not throw.
- These tests target the most important implemented pieces (build config and DOM helpers) and are organized as Vitest suites — this matches the project’s testing strategy and is LLM-friendly and repeatable.

However, there are clear gaps and issues that prevent the test suite from being a complete, robust verification layer today:
- Recent verification runs recorded TypeScript compile failures (TS5097) caused by test imports that include a trailing ".ts" extension; those errors caused the overall verify pipeline to fail. One such import was already fixed in helpers.test.ts, but other tests (e.g., tests/testing/setup.test.ts) may still need the same fix. Until all import-extension issues are resolved, the test pipeline will not reliably run.
- Coverage is not adequate against the project policy. The Universal Guide requires high coverage targets (90%+, and 100% coverage of public API), but current tests only cover a small subset of the package surface. Missing/absent tests include:
  - createVitestJsdomConfig factory (not implemented/tested)
  - Accessibility helpers (expectAccessible, getAccessibilityViolations, accessibilityTests)
  - Linting configuration factories (HTML/CSS/accessibility)
  - Template files and example integration tests
  - Export-equivalence and package-installation integration tests (required for the dual-export pattern)
  - Tests that verify dependency/version alignment per ADRs
- No evidence of a coverage gate in package.json (though test:ci runs vitest with --coverage), and current test set is too small to reach the stated coverage thresholds.

Summary judgement:
- Test surface: focused and appropriate for code that currently exists — good unit tests for implemented features.
- Passing status: currently unstable — TypeScript import-extension errors were recorded as the first failing items in the last verify run and must be fixed before reliable test execution.
- Coverage adequacy: inadequate relative to the project's stated targets (90%+). Current coverage will be well below this until the missing suites and integration tests are implemented.

Recommended immediate actions (minimal, single-file focused):
1. Fix remaining import-extension TS5097 errors in tests (remove trailing ".ts" from test imports) so tsc and Vitest run cleanly.
2. Run the verify sequence (type-check → build → test) and record the first failing test/error; address it with the single-file reactive loop.
3. Add tests incrementally for the missing factories and integration scenarios (createVitestJsdomConfig, accessibility utilities, lint factories, export-equivalence and package-install tests) to raise coverage toward the 90% goal.

Overall progress: approximately 50% of the necessary testing foundation is present (unit/smoke tests for core parts), but stability and coverage need focused work to satisfy the project's universal testing standards.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (80% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The package implementation is largely complete and many verification steps have succeeded in prior runs (TypeScript sources, build helpers, and a comprehensive Vitest test suite are in place). However the most recent full verification (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) did not complete successfully: the run failed due to TypeScript import-extension errors (TS5097) in test files that import paths ending with “.ts”. A partial fix was applied to src/testing/setup.ts earlier, and a change to tests/testing/helpers.test.ts (removing the `.ts` extension) was prepared but not yet staged/committed in the current working tree. Because of these outstanding test-import issues the verification pipeline is not currently green and build/test automation is blocked until the remaining import-extension fixes are committed and the verification is re-run. In short: core code and tests are mostly implemented and were runnable earlier, but the current repository state still fails the end-to-end verification and therefore the build/test scripts are not yet fully validated.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (78% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains solid, focused documentation for developers and LLM agents: a clear package README with quick-start and usage examples (vite, vitest, postcss, test helpers); a comprehensive set of ADRs in docs/decisions that capture design rationale and dependency decisions; library-usage docs for PostCSS and dev-config; and inline API surface information is present in built declaration files (dist/*.d.ts) and source code comments. Tests and examples serve as runnable documentation for expected behaviors. That said, gaps remain that prevent this from being "complete documentation" for all audiences—there is no consolidated auto-generated API reference (e.g., docs/api or TypeDoc output) covering all exports (testing helpers, linting factories, accessibility helpers, templates), limited examples for accessibility/jest-axe and linting factories, no CHANGELOG in the repo, and some developer-facing scripts and expectations are documented mainly in prompts/universal-guide.md rather than package-local docs. Recommendations (prioritized): 1) add a short API reference listing public exports and types (README or docs/api) and small usage snippets for testing helpers and linting factories, 2) add example templates (vitest/vite/test-setup) into templates/ with short README pointers, 3) include a CHANGELOG.md (or reference the template) and a brief CONTRIBUTING or developer setup note specific to this package (node engine, verify script expectations), and 4) surface markdown-lint generation instructions next to prepare scripts (or add a generated .markdownlint.json example). Overall the documentation is high-quality for an internal, LLM-driven workflow but missing a few consumer-facing API and example artifacts to be fully complete.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (75% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary: The package's declared dependencies and devDependencies look reasonable and modern for a UI tooling package: Vitest (3.x) and its V8 coverage provider are present and version-aligned, TypeScript is recent (5.x), PostCSS + Autoprefixer are used at v8/v10 ranges which are the expected major lines for many toolchains, and browser/test utilities (jsdom, testing-library, jest-axe) are included. There are no obvious red flags in the package.json itself (no wildly ancient versions, and the vitest / coverage provider alignment ADR has been followed).

- Freshness & compatibility:
  - Vitest (devDeps ^3.2.4 and peerDeps ^3.2.0) — currently on the 3.x major line: appropriate and consistent with the ADR that requires alignment with @vitest/coverage-v8. Good.
  - @vitest/coverage-v8 ^3.2.4 — present and aligned with vitest devDependency. Good.
  - TypeScript ^5.9.2 — recent major/minor; fine for NodeNext + ESM setup.
  - postcss ^8.x and autoprefixer ^10.x — these are common, stable major versions for many projects. PostCSS v8 is still widely used; if you plan to adopt postcss v9 you should check compatibility, but nothing here is inherently incompatible.
  - jsdom ^26.x, testing-library, jest-axe — typical choices for jsdom-based UI testing.
  - markdownlint-cli2 ^0.18.1 — matches the monorepo decision; acceptable.
  - @types/node ^24.3.0 — type declarations are recent; ensure they match your Node engine target (README requests Node ≥22.6.0).

- Security / vulnerability posture:
  - I cannot run npm audit or inspect transitive packages from here, so I cannot guarantee there are no vulnerabilities. Based on the explicit versions, there are no immediate, obvious flags (e.g., no deprecated/unmaintained packages declared). However, security risks usually come from transitive dependencies; you must run automated SCA tooling to be sure.
  - Action required: run `npm audit` / `npm audit --json` (or your org SCA tooling) and address any high/critical findings. Additionally run `npm outdated` to see patch/minor updates available.

- Version alignment notes & best-practice suggestions:
  - The project follows the ADR requiring exact alignment for vitest / @vitest/coverage-v8 — that’s good and reduces peer-dep runtime errors.
  - A few packages appear both in peerDependencies and devDependencies (e.g., autoprefixer, postcss, jsdom, vitest, jest-axe). This is acceptable for configuration packages (declaring runtime expectations for consumers via peerDependencies while keeping dev copies for testing), but ensure versions remain aligned and documented in ADRs when upgraded.
  - Consider pinning or documenting engine constraints (package README mentions Node >= 22.6.0). If you rely on experimental Node features (e.g., TypeScript config loading), make that explicit in package.json `engines` to avoid consumer confusion.

- Immediate recommendations (practical next steps):
  1. Run the project-local SCA checks:
     - npm audit (or org SCA) and address high/critical issues.
     - npm outdated to see minor/patch updates; prefer applying patch/minor updates where safe.
  2. Confirm transitive dependency health for packages that operate on native binaries (if any) or known-risk packages (e.g., older postcss plugins). Fix or upgrade as required.
  3. Keep vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8 aligned as the ADR requires whenever performing upgrades.
  4. Periodically run `npm ci` and `npm run test:ci` in CI to detect runtime/compatibility issues early.
  5. If you adopt new major versions (e.g., PostCSS v9 or Vite v6→v7), create ADRs per policy and run integration tests.

- Confidence & completeness caveat:
  - This assessment is based solely on the package.json entries and known patterns — I could not run `npm audit`, `npm outdated`, or inspect the lockfile / resolved transitive versions. Therefore the assessment is about 75% complete: the declared dependencies look modern and consistent, but final security assurance requires running SCA tools and verifying transitive dependency versions and advisories.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary
  - The codebase is small, mostly configuration factories and lightweight test helpers. There are no obvious network-facing servers, credential management, or runtime telemetry in the package itself. The most significant risks are supply‑chain (npm dependency) and developer/workflow scripts that execute code during local/package lifecycle (prepare scripts). No direct remote I/O, sockets, or external secrets usage are present in the source files reviewed.

- Identified security issues & risks
  1. Supply‑chain risk (devDependencies & peerDependencies)
     - The package relies on multiple third‑party modules (autoprefixer, postcss, vite, vitest, jsdom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2, etc.). A compromise of any dependency (especially build/test tooling) could execute malicious code during developer builds/tests.
     - Mitigation: maintain lockfile (package-lock.json), run regular SCA (npm audit / Snyk / Dependabot), pin critical dev deps where required by policy, validate dependency upgrades with ADRs and tests.
  2. Arbitrary script execution via lifecycle scripts
     - package.json "prepare": "node ../../setup-package-docs.js" (and "voder" script referencing ../../../voder/...) will execute code outside the package directory during local install/prepare. Running scripts that reference files outside the package boundary increases risk if the workspace root is tampered with or if the package is installed in an unexpected location.
     - Mitigation: avoid prepare scripts that execute code outside the package root; document and audit such scripts; ensure restrictive CI/checkout permissions and that scripts run in trusted developer environments only.
  3. Potential hiding of failures / silent catches
     - Some code swallows errors (e.g., helper mounting catch blocks in helpers.ts and the guarded dynamic plugin import in vite.config.ts). Silent failures can mask tampering or unexpected behavior during build/test.
     - Mitigation: log unexpected errors to stderr (console.error) and ensure verification runs surface failures in CI; consider less‑permissive handling when running in CI.
  4. Dynamic optional plugin loading
     - The async vite.config.ts dynamically imports an optional plugin and swallows errors; although safe for optionality, loading arbitrary optional plugins (if added) can introduce code execution during dev/build.
     - Mitigation: document optional plugin expectations, ensure plugin sources are trusted, and prefer explicit installation in developer docs if needed.
  5. Unvalidated configuration inputs
     - createViteLibraryConfig and createPostCSSConfig accept consumer-supplied configuration objects (postcss plugins array, entry paths). These are intended usage patterns, but if used with untrusted inputs they could result in executing arbitrary plugin code during builds.
     - Mitigation: document that configuration inputs must be trusted and come from consumers; where appropriate perform light validation/normalization and fail fast on obviously invalid types.
  6. Tests / helpers operating on DOM with untrusted HTML
     - The testing helpers mount components and interact with DOM nodes. If consumers mount untrusted HTML with these helpers without sanitization, there is an XSS-like risk in environments that evaluate scripts in test harnesses.
     - Mitigation: keep warnings in README (already present), avoid executing or evaluating untrusted HTML in tests, and ensure test harness does not run in production contexts.
  7. Potential logging of secrets to .voder/history.md
     - The “console‑first” policy means all console output is persisted to .voder/history.md. This is useful for auditing but increases the risk of accidental secret leakage if secret values are printed to console during verification or scripts.
     - Mitigation: review scripts to avoid logging secrets, add a checklist to avoid printing env secrets, and consider filtering or redaction for known sensitive values before they reach console.
  8. Tracked build outputs / repository cleanliness
     - The repository contains dist/ files in the working listing; committing compiled outputs can increase attack surface and confuse provenance. The project guidelines require dist/ to be gitignored; verify no compiled artifacts are committed in main history or package tarballs.
     - Mitigation: ensure dist/ not committed; use git rm --cached for any accidentally committed build outputs; keep .gitignore and lockfile under review.

- Best practices & recommendations
  - Supply‑chain hygiene
    - Keep an up‑to‑date lockfile, run automated SCA in CI, and treat devDependency upgrades with ADRs/tests per the project's policy.
    - Consider reproducible installs (npm ci) in developer and CI flows.
  - Minimize script surface
    - Avoid lifecycle scripts that execute code outside the package directory (eg. ../../setup-package-docs.js). If required for monorepo workflows, clearly document and review them; restrict to trusted environments.
  - Surface errors and avoid silent failures
    - Replace silent catch blocks with console.error logging (to stderr) and explicit failure in CI contexts; ensure unexpected errors do not silently continue.
  - Validate/guard inputs
    - Add simple runtime checks for configuration shapes (e.g., ensure postcssConfig.plugins is an array) and fail fast with descriptive errors.
  - Secret handling
    - Ensure .env and other secret files are ignored and never printed. Add a developer policy and consider a pre‑verify check that prevents pushing console logs containing common secret patterns.
  - Testing safety
    - Keep tests and helpers isolated and not executed in production contexts. Document that testing helpers expect trusted component code.
  - Audit repository for committed build artifacts or secrets
    - Run a repo scan for accidentally committed secrets or third‑party built artifacts and remove them from history if found.

- Residual risk & confidence
  - Confidence in static code-level risk assessment is moderate (80% ± 10%). The primary residual risk is supply‑chain and lifecycle script execution which cannot be fully assessed from the code alone (requires reviewing lockfile provenance, CI policies, and the referenced setup scripts). No immediate critical vulnerabilities visible in source code, but supply chain and script execution policies deserve attention and remediation as above.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ±5% COMPLETE)
- The repository is **not** in a clean, fully-synchronized state. There is at least one modified file in the working tree and local commits that have not been pushed — this prevents the repo from being considered publishable or fully version-controlled.
- Details:
  - Uncommitted changes: Git status shows one modified file (tests/testing/helpers.test.ts) that is not staged. Because there are unstaged/modified files, the repository cannot be considered fully committed (this alone limits completeness severely).
  - Unpushed commits: The current branch is ahead of origin/main by 2 commits (local commits exist that have not been pushed). Presence of unpushed commits further reduces synchronization completeness.
  - File tracking / ignores: File-tracking summary reports 37 tracked files, 0 untracked files, and 6 git-ignored files. Important build/artifact paths (dist/, node_modules/, etc.) are present in .gitignore. The .voderignore exposes !dist/ for LLM visibility but dist/ remains git-ignored — that is correct per policy.
  - Clean working state: Because there are both uncommitted changes and unpushed commits, the working tree is not clean or fully synchronized; it is not in a publishable state.
- Conclusion: With unstaged changes and local commits not yet pushed, the repository meets only a small fraction of the "complete & synchronized" criteria. Resolve the modified file (commit or discard), push local commits, and re-verify there are no remaining unstaged/unstaged or untracked critical files to reach a clean, publishable state.
