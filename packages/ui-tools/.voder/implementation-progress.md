Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (51% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What’s complete
  - Minimal, correct PostCSS factory implemented and exported (createPostCSSConfig). Dist contains compiled artifacts for that export.
  - Good ADR coverage and thorough design/spec documentation (docs/decisions/, prompts/), which provides a clear implementation roadmap.
  - TypeScript configuration is set up (NodeNext, strict, declaration output), and tsc runs successfully after the recent tsconfig fix.
  - package.json contains many of the expected dev/peer dependencies (vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8 alignment, postcss/autoprefixer, jsdom, testing libraries) which is useful groundwork.

- What’s missing or failing
  - Core functional features are largely unimplemented: the Vite library config factory, Vitest jsdom factory, testing helpers (renderComponent, accessibility helpers), linting config factories, templates and most exports described in the spec are not present in source. (FUNCTIONALITY: 20%)
  - Tests are minimal and the verification pipeline is blocked by a runtime error (Vitest/Vite startup: missing vite-plugin-inline-source). No full test suite ran and coverage requirements are not met. (TESTING: 25%)
  - Execution is only partial: tsc/build passes, but tests fail at startup so end-to-end verification is not green. (EXECUTION: 60%)
  - Package-level consumer-facing documentation is missing (no README.md, no API reference, no templates/CHANGELOG). Internal docs/ADRs are strong but consumer docs are incomplete. (DOCUMENTATION: 45%)
  - Some dependency/version mismatches and metadata issues exist (e.g., jest-axe versions in peer vs dev, autoprefixer in both peer and dev). A supply‑chain audit has not been reported yet. (DEPENDENCIES: 70%)
  - Security posture is generally acceptable for the small code surface, but supply‑chain and lifecycle scripts (prepare) require attention and audits. (SECURITY: 80%)
  - Version control is not clean: there are unstaged/modified .voder metadata files and at least one local commit is ahead of origin/main (unpushed). This prevents the repo from being considered publishable or clean. (VERSION_CONTROL: 25%)
  - Code quality for the implemented pieces is good (clear, ESM/TypeScript patterns followed). (CODE_QUALITY: 85%)

- Reference of sub-assessment findings
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 20% — core package features largely unimplemented (only PostCSS factory present).
  - CODE_QUALITY: 85% — implemented code is clean and correct for its scope.
  - TESTING: 25% — tests either missing or blocked by runtime module resolution error.
  - EXECUTION: 60% — build/type-check OK; test startup fails.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 45% — strong internal ADRs/specs, lacking consumer README/API.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 70% — modern toolchain but some mismatches and audit unknowns.
  - SECURITY: 80% — no direct code vulnerabilities, supply-chain risk to audit.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 25% — unstaged changes and an unpushed commit leave the repo unsynchronized.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Highest priority immediate actions (smallest steps that unblock the largest number of remaining issues), ordered:

1. Restore a clean version-control state (very small, safe, and required):
   - Commit the intended .voder metadata changes (or stash/restore if not intended). The project’s policy expects .voder/* changes to be persisted when deliberate. Example: git add -- .voder/* && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): persist .voder metadata updates" && git push origin main.
   - Push any local commits to origin/main so remote and local are synchronized.
   Rationale: a clean, synchronized repo is a prerequisite for safe iterative remediation and for the CI/verify pipeline to reflect the current source.

2. Diagnose and fix the Vitest/Vite startup error (module-not-found):
   - Run the diagnostic steps (npm ls vite-plugin-inline-source, grep for references, inspect vite.config.ts) and capture outputs.
   - Based on findings, either:
     - Add the missing devDependency (vite-plugin-inline-source) if it's required by the current vite.config; or
     - Remove or guard the import in vite.config.ts (lazy import or conditional require) if the plugin is not necessary for tests to run.
   - Commit the minimal change (either package.json + lockfile or code change) and re-run the verification: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test.
   Rationale: Tests are blocked by this import error. Fixing it will allow test suites to run and surface real failures, enabling progress on testing and functionality.

3. Re-run the full verification pipeline and capture console output:
   - After steps (1) and (2), run the verification pipeline to get the current test output and audit results. This will provide the concrete failures to address next.
   - If audit reports critical vulnerabilities, remediate per ADRs.

4. Implement the next small, high-value feature slice: Vite library config factory + unit tests:
   - Implement src/build/vite-library.ts per spec (createViteLibraryConfig).
   - Add focused unit tests (tests/build/vite-library.test.ts) to validate ESM-only output and PostCSS integration.
   - Export the factory from src/index.ts and add tests verifying that dist exports load as expected (once build/test pipeline runs).
   Rationale: This is the next major functional area referenced by the guide and is small enough to implement + test in one increment; it will increase functionality from 20% toward completion and unlock more integration tests.

Secondary items (after the above unblockers)
- Add mandatory scripts required by the universal guide (verify, lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix).
- Reconcile peer/dev version mismatches (jest-axe, autoprefixer) and update ADRs if needed.
- Add README.md (consumer-facing) and templates/ files described in the guide.
- Expand Vitest suites to cover package-structure, export-equivalence, smoke, and package-installation integration tests to meet coverage goals.

If you’d like, I can:
- Provide the minimal non-interactive diagnostic commands to run next (for the vite-plugin issue) and explain how to interpret their outputs; or
- Prepare a small patch to guard/remove the vite-plugin-inline-source import so tests can run immediately (one-file change + commit message), followed by running the verification steps.

Which action would you like me to produce next: (A) commands & diagnostics to run locally, or (B) a minimal code/packaging patch to unblock tests and a suggested commit message?



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (20% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary: The repository currently implements a very small fraction of the requested @voder/ui-tools functionality. The PostCSS factory (createPostCSSConfig) is present and exported (the minimal public barrel exposes PostCSS). Many major features, exports, tests and mandated scripts described in the specification remain unimplemented or incomplete. The package cannot yet fulfil the core responsibilities of UI build/testing/linting tooling.

Detailed assessment vs. requirements

- Core responsibilities
  - Library Build Configuration (Vite library factory)
    - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
    - Notes: createViteLibraryConfig and vite-library.ts are required by the guide but are not present in src (only referenced in prompts/docs). No exported Vite config factory exists in the source barrel beyond PostCSS.
  - CSS Processing (PostCSS + Autoprefixer)
    - Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED (small, correct slice)
    - Notes: createPostCSSConfig exists and is exported (src/index.ts and dist contain PostCSS export). This satisfies the CSS-postcss factory requirement at a minimal level.
  - UI Testing (jsdom Vitest config and helpers)
    - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
    - Notes: Testing factories (createVitestJsdomConfig), helpers (renderComponent, simulateClick, etc.), and setup are described but not present in src exports. Vitest configuration factory required for UI packages is absent.
  - Accessibility Testing (jest-axe integration and helpers)
    - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
    - Notes: Accessibility utilities and jest-axe usage are in the spec but not implemented/exported in source.
  - HTML/CSS/Accessibility Linting configs
    - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
    - Notes: createHTMLLintConfig/createCSSLintConfig/createAccessibilityLintConfig are in the guide but not present in source exports.
  - Component Test Utilities
    - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
    - Notes: renderComponent and related helpers are not available.

- Exports & packaging
  - Main export barrel
    - Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
    - Notes: src/index.ts only exports PostCSS factory (and dist reflects that). The expected complete barrel (build, testing, linting, utils) is not present.
  - Dual export / package.json exports
    - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED / INCOMPLETE
    - Notes: The package.json does not declare the complex dual export structure described in the universal guide (exports pointing at dist/, dedicated paths like ./testing, ./eslint, ./prettier). Tests that validate package.json export paths (mandatory) are missing.

- Tests & verification
  - Vitest test suites (unit, integration, package-structure, export-equivalence, package-installation)
    - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED (or not visible)
    - Notes: The specification mandates many Vitest-based tests to validate exports, packaging, and behavior. They are not present in the current source tree exposed here (only PostCSS factory test was mentioned historically but not visible among current committed source files).
  - test:ci and coverage configuration
    - Status: PARTIALLY CONFIGURED (scripts exist) but enforcement missing
    - Notes: package.json has test/test:ci scripts configured, and devDependencies include vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8, but the test implementations and required tests that enforce coverage thresholds are missing.

- Development scripts & tooling
  - Required standardized scripts (verify, lint, lint:fix, format, lint:md, lint:md:fix, prepare, voder)
    - Status: PARTIAL / INCOMPLETE
    - Notes: package.json contains type-check, build, test, clean, prepare, and voder. It lacks mandatory scripts like verify, lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix that the guide requires.
  - ESLint / Prettier config files and integration
    - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED
    - Notes: No eslint.config.js or prettier.config.ts present. tsconfig includes prettier.config.ts in include, but that file does not exist.

- TypeScript build output / dist
  - Status: PRESENT (but minimal)
  - Notes: dist/src/index.js and .d.ts exist and expose the PostCSS export. The universal guide expects dist/ to be gitignored but visible via .voderignore; however, the package should compile all exports to dist and package.json export fields should point to dist files — that packaging is not complete.

- Dependency management & ADRs
  - ADRs and docs
    - Status: WELL-POPULATED (docs/decisions exist)
    - Notes: Many ADRs and documentation files are present (good). However, several ADR-mandated actions (e.g., adding peer deps with ADR) are not fully reflected as needed by package exports/tests.
  - Dependencies
    - Status: Partly present
    - Notes: package.json declares relevant peerDependencies/devDependencies (vitest, postcss, autoprefixer, jest-axe, jsdom). That is useful groundwork, but the code that requires them is not implemented yet.

- Policy & repository hygiene
  - Console-first/no-repo-output policy
    - Status: N/A for functionality (policy supported by .gitignore/.voderignore present)
    - Notes: .gitignore and .voderignore are configured per guide; however dist/ is present in the repository which contradicts the "never commit dist" guidance (though .voderignore intends to make it visible to the LLM). Functionally this does not implement features.

Conclusions and recommended next smallest slice (functional priority)
- The repository currently implements ~1 of ~10 major functional areas (PostCSS factory), so overall functional completion is low (~20%).
- To make meaningful progress with minimal change, implement the Vite library config factory (createViteLibraryConfig) and its unit tests next; that is the next high-value, small-surface feature directly referenced by the guide and will enable more build/test integration and further test writing.
- Simultaneously add the missing standardized scripts (lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix) to package.json to align with verification workflows; these are small changes that unlock automated verification and ADR requirements.

Summary numeric assessment: 20% complete (±10%).

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The actual source code present (src/index.ts + src/build/postcss.ts as implemented earlier) is small, focused and generally correct:
  - createPostCSSConfig implements the intended PostCSS/autoprefixer factory with sensible defaults and a simple, testable output shape.
  - The public barrel (src/index.ts) cleanly re-exports the PostCSS factory and its types using explicit .js extension (ESM-friendly pattern consistent with NodeNext/module resolution).
  - TypeScript compiler options (NodeNext/module resolution, strict mode, declaration output) are appropriate for the code patterns used.
  - The code is readable, documented, and follows the project’s ESM/TypeScript patterns.

- Issues and concerns that lower the score:
  - Incomplete implementation vs spec: the repository advertises and documents many modules (vite config factory, testing helpers, linting factories, templates, tests, etc.) but only the PostCSS factory is actually available in source. This is a functional gap (not a bug in the implemented code, but it means the package is not feature-complete).
  - Duplicate dependency expression (package.json): autoprefixer appears in both peerDependencies and devDependencies. This is a package metadata smell (not a runtime code bug) and can confuse consumers and installers.
  - package.json lacks main/exports entries pointing at dist/ artifacts (the project policy expects dual/dual-export strategy). That is a packaging/configuration omission which can cause consumer import/resolution problems even if the source compiles correctly.
  - Potential for subtle TypeScript / import resolution friction: importing .js extension from .ts sources is correct under NodeNext, but is dependent on the tsconfig/module settings; this has already caused earlier tsc hiccups in the repo history (they were fixed, but the setup is brittle if configs drift).
  - Minimal test coverage present in the tree (history references tests were added, but the repository currently appears to have failing verification runs because of missing runtime plugins). Lack of thorough automated tests increases risk of regressions.
  - Minor stylistic nit: src/index.ts contains a leading space before the comment/line; trivial but inconsistent.

- Risk areas unrelated to the tiny codebase itself but affecting correctness:
  - Runtime/test startup errors observed in history (missing vite-plugin-inline-source) indicate the test/runtime environment may fail even when the TypeScript sources compile. Those are integration/runtime issues (dependency or config), not direct bugs within createPostCSSConfig.
  - The public API surface is very small (only PostCSS factory). If consumers expect the broader ui-tools API from the documentation, that mismatch is a correctness/consistency problem.

Summary: the implemented code is correct and adheres to the project’s ESM/TypeScript conventions for the functionality that exists. However, repository-level packaging metadata, dependency duplication, incomplete feature surface, and missing/fragile integration tests lower overall code quality and increase the risk of runtime/integration failures. Addressing packaging metadata, removing duplicate dep declarations, adding the missing modules (or adjusting docs), and strengthening tests will raise quality to near 100%.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (25% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- There are a few unit tests authored (notably a PostCSS factory unit test and planned accessibility tests per the guides), but the test run is currently failing before any suites execute because Vitest/Vite startup errors occur (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: vite-plugin-inline-source). As a result: no tests actually ran, no coverage was produced, and the repository does not meet the required coverage thresholds (90%+). Overall test surface is minimal (only a small number of unit tests exist), many required categories (export-integration, package-structure, installation/integration, smoke, export-equivalence) are missing, and automated verification is blocked by the runtime module resolution error — so testing is incomplete and currently failing end-to-end.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (60% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Partial success: Type-check and TypeScript build completed successfully (tsc runs & emitted no errors after the tsconfig.module fix), so the build pipeline (tsc) appears to work. However the full verification pipeline is not validated because tests fail at startup: Vitest/Vite cannot start due to a runtime module resolution error (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND) for "vite-plugin-inline-source" imported from node_modules/.vite-temp/vite.config.ts. Because test startup fails, the test stage (vitest run / test:ci) and the end‑to‑end verification are blocked. Overall execution is working up through build, but end-to-end validation (tests + coverage) is not passing.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (45% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Strengths:
  - Good ADR coverage: A complete set of decision records (docs/decisions/) is present and well‑formed — license, dependency, tooling, and CSS preprocessing decisions are documented and dated. This is excellent for maintainers and auditability.
  - Design & implementation guidance: The prompts/development-ui-tools.md and prompts/universal-guide.md are extremely comprehensive and contain implementation-level guidance, API examples, test strategy, and usage patterns — effectively a design + spec document.
  - Library usage docs exist for dev-config (docs/libraries/usage/voder-dev-config.md) with examples, peer dependency guidance, and quick start details.
  - Package metadata (package.json, tsconfig) and export expectations are documented across the ADRs/prompts, so the intended consumer surface and scripts are clear if one reads the specs.

- Key gaps / missing items:
  - No package README.md for @voder/ui-tools (public, consumer-facing). The repository lacks a self-contained README in the package root that follows the README template requirements (quick start, installation, API examples, security posture, license statement). This is a high-priority omission because README is the primary consumer entry point.
  - No API reference documentation generated or committed. While prompts include example exports and usage, there is no dedicated API docs (e.g., README API section, docs/api.md, or typed reference) that enumerate exported functions/types and their signatures for @voder/ui-tools.
  - Templates and example config files referenced in the guide (templates/, vitest.config.ts, vite.config.ts, test-setup files) are described but not present as committed artifacts in the repository root/package (I did not see a templates/ directory or package README). This reduces discoverability for consumers.
  - No CHANGELOG.md present. The guide expects a CHANGELOG template; none is committed.
  - Missing package-level docs about peerDependencies and installation caveats. The dev-config usage doc exists, but there’s no dedicated consumer guidance for @voder/ui-tools (what peers to install, Node engine requirements, how to enable TypeScript configs, etc.)
  - No generated .markdownlint.json or clear instructions in package README showing how to run markdown linting. The universal guide mandates markdown lint scripts; they are not visible in package.json scripts beyond prepare/voder.
  - No CONTRIBUTING.md, no short SECURITY or security posture section in a public README (the ADRs require README security posture).
  - Tests & coverage documentation: the test strategy is described in prompts, but there is no docs/tests.md or consolidated guide showing how to run tests locally with environment notes (Node version, NODE_OPTIONS for TS config).
  - README isolation policy not yet enforced (many internal docs exist under prompts/ and docs/ but there is no published README that follows the “self-contained” rule).

- Recommendations (prioritized):
  1. Add a package README.md at package root that is self-contained and follows the required template:
     - Quick start (install, minimal usage)
     - API examples (from src/index.ts exports)
     - Security posture section
     - License notice (UNLICENSED)
     - Peer dependency and Node engine requirements
  2. Add an API reference section (in README or docs/api.md) listing exported factories and types with short signatures and examples (createPostCSSConfig, createViteLibraryConfig, createVitestJsdomConfig, testing helpers, accessibility helpers, linting factories).
  3. Commit example template files referenced by the guide (templates/vitest.config.ts, templates/vite.config.ts, templates/test-setup.jsdom.ts) or clearly document how consumers obtain them.
  4. Add CHANGELOG.md and CONTRIBUTING.md (or reference canonical templates) to match the guide.
  5. Add explicit documentation for test & CI usage (how to run test:ci locally, coverage thresholds, NODE_OPTIONS requirement if any).
  6. Ensure package.json scripts include markdown lint scripts and document how to generate .markdownlint.json (or commit the generated config) so doc linting is reproducible.
  7. Optionally generate a small docs/index.md that aggregates ADRs, usage, and API links to improve discoverability for new maintainers.

- Overall assessment: The repository contains rich internal design and ADR documentation (great for maintainers), but it lacks the consumer-facing and API documentation artifacts required for a complete package delivery (README, API reference, templates, CHANGELOG). Filling those gaps would move documentation from “internal spec complete” to “consumer-ready and discoverable.”

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (70% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall status: The package lists a modern set of devDependencies and peerDependencies that are aligned with an up‑to‑date toolchain (TypeScript, Vitest, jsdom, PostCSS/Autoprefixer, etc.). The vitest ↔ @vitest/coverage‑v8 alignment is explicitly pinned to compatible 3.2.x versions (good), and TypeScript/Node typings target recent majors. There are no runtime dependencies (package is tooling-focused), which reduces direct production attack surface, but dev/peer dependency vulnerabilities can still affect CI/maintainers.

- Notable items and compatibility concerns:
  - Good: vitest and @vitest/coverage‑v8 are aligned at ^3.2.4 (addresses ADR about exact alignment).
  - Potential mismatch: peerDependencies declare jest-axe "^9.0.0" while devDependencies include "jest-axe": "^10.0.0". That difference will surface warnings for consumers and could cause version resolution surprises; this should be reconciled (either bump peer to ^10.x or pin dev to ^9.x and add an ADR explaining the choice).
  - Peer list includes vite "^6.0.0" but vite is not present in devDependencies. If local builds/tests or templates import Vite-only plugins (or tests spin up Vite), CI/devs may see missing-package errors. Ensure consumers/installers understand vite is a peer requirement or add vite as a devDependency for package development if you run Vite tooling locally.
  - postcss/autoprefixer are present (postcss ^8.x and autoprefixer ^10.x) — these are stable, widely used majors; verify any plugin compatibility when upgrading Vite or other build tools.
  - jsdom ^26 and @testing-library/dom ^10 are recent and appropriate for jsdom-based tests.
  - TypeScript ^5.9.2 and @types/node ^24.x target modern Node/TS features; confirm CI Node engine (package.json doesn't assert an engines field) supports required Node version for these tool versions.
  - markdownlint-cli2 ^0.18.1 is listed as a devDependency (and required by ADR). PeerDependencies in other docs mention markdownlint-cli2 ^0.13.0 — check for intended peer range vs dev version; minor mismatch may be benign but worth confirming.

- Security posture:
  - I cannot determine actual vulnerabilities without running npm audit / supply‑chain scans. The presence of modern, widely used packages reduces likelihood of severe unknown issues, but any non-zero-risk transitive dependency could appear. Run `npm audit --json` and review results; treat high/critical findings in devDependencies as actionable for CI security posture (even dev tooling can be abused in CI).
  - Keep lockfile current (package-lock.json present per history) and run periodic audits and dependency updates. Follow the ADRs: bundle dependency changes with ADR documentation when adding direct dependencies.

- Actionable recommendations (next steps):
  1. Run automated checks: `npm audit --json` and `npm outdated --json` and review results.
  2. Reconcile version mismatches:
     - Align jest-axe peer vs dev versions (choose ^10.x or ^9.x and update peer/dev accordingly).
     - Confirm markdownlint-cli2 peer/dev ranges if applicable.
     - Decide whether vite should be added to devDependencies for local dev/test runs.
  3. If any high/critical audit findings appear, address them (update packages, apply patches, or add ADRs as required).
  4. Keep vitest and @vitest/coverage‑v8 version alignment policy enforced via tests or CI checks (already noted in ADR).

- Confidence: Medium — package versions look current and thought‑through, with a few mismatches and the unknown of audit findings. Concrete security status requires running `npm audit` and `npm outdated`.

<scratchpad>
- Review codebase files provided: package.json, src exports, tests snippets, scripts, docs.
- Identify possible security issues: supply-chain (devDependencies / peerDependencies), arbitrary script execution (prepare), use of child_process.execSync in tests and helpers (pack/install), global mocks, DOM helpers mounting components (possible XSS if used with untrusted HTML), writing files in tests (they write to temp directories, fine).
- Note that package is private and monorepo; prepare script runs ../../setup-package-docs.js which may execute on npm install—risk surface limited to monorepo, but mention it.
- No network calls or secrets in code. No storage of sensitive data. No direct file writes to repo except tests create temp files (they use mkdtemp in docs examples).
- Recommend running npm audit, pinning or locking versions, verifying vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 alignment, avoid executing untrusted scripts, sanitize execSync inputs, isolate test execution, CI supply-chain scanning, consider adding engines field (already present in some docs but not package.json; but not required).
- Provide final assessment with percent and recommendations.
</scratchpad>

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary
  - There are no obvious direct code-level vulnerabilities (no credential leaks, no network calls, no persistent storage of secrets, no unsafe eval or deserialization). The source is mostly configuration factories and test helpers; surface of risky logic is small.
  - The primary security surface is supply‑chain and script execution (dev/tooling lifecycle), not runtime business logic. Most risks relate to dependency choice/versions and npm lifecycle scripts that execute code.

- Supply-chain risks (highest priority)
  - Multiple devDependencies and peerDependencies are present (vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, postcss, autoprefixer, jsdom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2, etc.). These enlarge the attack surface and may contain known vulnerabilities. Action: run `npm audit --json` and review the lockfile; keep dependencies pinned/locked and update with review/ADRs.
  - Version alignment is required for vitest ↔ @vitest/coverage-v8 (ADR notes this). Mismatched versions can cause runtime errors and inadvertently pull incompatible transitive packages — verify alignment and add automated tests that detect version mismatches.
  - The test/integration flows call external commands via child_process.execSync (npm pack, npm install) in temporary dirs. Running those steps will execute package lifecycle scripts from the produced tarball and installed packages; if a malicious package were introduced in dependencies it could execute arbitrary code during test/pack/install. Action: run those steps in isolated CI environments, as non-root, and audit packages before executing; prefer sandboxing or use Node/VFS features where possible.

- Lifecycle/script execution risks
  - package.json includes a "prepare" script: `node ../../setup-package-docs.js`. `prepare` runs during npm install for local installs and when the package is prepared. This executes repository code during installs—acceptable in a monorepo but increases risk if the package is ever consumed outside the controlled environment. Action: ensure `setup-package-docs.js` is audited, minimal, and safe; avoid executing arbitrary external input in lifecycle scripts; document the requirement and limit prepare behavior to dev-only contexts.
  - Tests and examples use execSync and spawn shell commands. Any use of shell/exec must avoid passing untrusted input and should validate or escape inputs. Action: ensure all execSync calls use fixed command strings (they do in snippets) and any dynamic paths are sanitized.

- Code-level/usage risks
  - renderComponent mounts component instances into jsdom and delegates mounting to component.mount(). The helper itself doesn't sanitize component output; if test components rely on untrusted input and use innerHTML, XSS-like behavior could be simulated in tests — a test/time issue rather than production vulnerability. Action: document that test helpers operate in a test environment only; avoid using them with untrusted HTML or add an explicit note in docs.
  - Globals are mocked in setup (matchMedia, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver). These mocks are standard for tests but care should be taken to reset/restore them and not leak into other tests or production code. The setup function uses afterEach cleanup, which is good.

- File system & repo integrity
  - The project’s policies forbid writing files in the repository; code examples comply by using OS temp directories in docs. Ensure tests always write only to temp dirs (the provided tests do) and perform cleanup (they attempt to).
  - The project uses a lockfile (package-lock.json) — good for reproducible installs. Keep lockfile committed and reviewed for unexpected package additions.

- Configuration and environment flags
  - Some docs reference Node flags (e.g., --experimental-strip-types). Using experimental flags is not inherently insecure but may change behavior across environments. Ensure CI/consumers are aware and that no unreviewed transformations occur.
  - tsconfig has "skipLibCheck": true — reduces type-safety but not a security issue per se.

- Recommendations / mitigations
  1. Run `npm audit --json` and address critical/high issues; include supply-chain audit in verify scripts or CI scanning (ADR-0007 suggests this).
  2. Keep package-lock.json up to date, review changes, and pin or restrict versions where peer alignment is required (vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8).
  3. Audit lifecycle scripts (prepare, voder) and any helper scripts (setup-package-docs.js) to ensure they do not perform unsafe operations or execute untrusted input. Consider restricting prepare to dev-only execution contexts or document risk clearly.
  4. Sandbox or isolate execution of `npm pack` / `npm install` used in tests (run in disposable containers or as non-privileged user) because they will execute package lifecycle scripts of the tarball and its deps.
  5. Avoid introducing exec/child_process commands that include unescaped user input. Sanitize any dynamic values used in execSync/exec.
  6. Establish automated dependency scanning and supply-chain checks in CI (npm audit, Snyk, OSV, or similar) and add tests for dependency version alignment where ADR mandates it.
  7. Ensure test helpers and README clearly mark that helpers and configs are for test/dev usage only (no production injection of test mocks).
  8. Limit install-time side-effects for consumers: prefer that any doc-setup scripts be opt-in rather than executed during an install in consumer contexts, if this package will ever be published outside the monorepo.

- Final judgement
  - No critical code vulnerabilities were found in the source itself, but medium‑risk supply‑chain and lifecycle script execution issues exist and should be mitigated as described. The security posture can be significantly improved by regular audit, stricter control of lifecycle scripts, and isolating test install/pack operations.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ±5% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, synchronized state and is therefore far from publishable: there are unstaged/modified files in the working tree and at least one local commit that has not been pushed to origin. Because uncommitted changes exist the overall completeness must be capped low.
- Specifics: git status shows modified (unstaged) .voder metadata files (.voder/history.md, .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md, etc.) — these are uncommitted; the branch is ahead of origin/main by 1 commit (unpushed). File-tracking looks otherwise OK (no untracked important files), and .gitignore is present, but note that dist/ artifacts appear in the tree (verify whether dist/ files are tracked — build outputs should normally be ignored). Until the unstaged changes are committed (or intentionally discarded) and local commits are pushed, the repository cannot be considered clean or fully synchronized.
