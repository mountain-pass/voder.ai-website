Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (46% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- Summary of what’s complete
  - A minimal, correct PostCSS factory (createPostCSSConfig) is implemented and exported; TypeScript build (tsc) completes and emits dist/ artifacts. This is the single, working functional slice.
  - DevDependencies and ADRs are present and reasonably aligned (Vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8 version alignment, modern TypeScript, markdownlint choice, etc.). Dependency choices are intentional and mostly up-to-date.
  - Basic security posture is sound in source (no direct secrets or unsafe filesystem/network calls) and package.json marks the package private/UNLICENSED.

- Summary of what’s missing or broken (high-level)
  - Functional completeness: The package implements only the PostCSS portion. Core responsibilities required by the design are missing: Vite library config factory, Vitest jsdom config factory, DOM testing helpers, accessibility utilities, linting config factories, templates and example artifacts, dual export map and packaging exports map, and the standardized scripts (verify, lint:md, format, etc.). (FUNCTIONALITY: 25%)
  - Tests: The test surface is nascent. Mandatory test categories from the Universal Guide (export-equivalence, package-structure, smoke, package-installation integration, vitest/provider alignment tests) are not implemented. Previous verification run failed to complete because Vitest startup hit ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for an optional plugin. Tests are not passing and coverage requirements are far from met. (TESTING: 15%)
  - Version control & working state: There are unstaged/modified files and at least one local commit ahead of origin/main. The repository is not in a clean, fully synchronized state. (VERSION_CONTROL: 25%)
  - Documentation: No package README, no CHANGELOG, and missing consumer-facing API docs and example usage files. ADRs and decision docs are excellent, but consumer-facing docs are incomplete. (DOCUMENTATION: 30%)
  - Code quality and execution: The code style and TypeScript setup are reasonably solid; tsc/build succeed and the guarded vite.config.ts change reduced a previously-observed test runtime error. However, some defensive error swallowing and missing standardized ESLint/Prettier scripts reduce robustness. (CODE_QUALITY: 60%, EXECUTION: 60%)
  - Dependencies and security: Dependency alignment (Vitest/provider) is good; run-time audits are still required. No immediate code-level security flaws observed, but supply-chain and lifecycle-script risks need routine audit/mitigation. (DEPENDENCIES: 75%, SECURITY: 80%)

- Reference to sub-assessment findings
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 25% — only PostCSS factory is implemented; most package responsibilities missing.
  - CODE_QUALITY: 60% — consistent TypeScript/ESM patterns, but missing ESLint config, silent error handling, and incomplete packaging metadata.
  - TESTING: 15% — tests are incomplete; Vitest failed to run to completion; coverage far below policy.
  - EXECUTION: 60% — tsc/build succeed; tests previously failed due to missing optional plugin and verification not re-run.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 30% — ADRs are complete; consumer README and CHANGELOG are absent.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 75% — intentional and mostly up-to-date; run `npm audit` recommended.
  - SECURITY: 80% — no code-level red flags, but supply-chain and lifecycle script risks remain.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 25% — unstaged/modified files and at least one unpushed commit; repository not fully synchronized.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Priority should target the lowest-scoring, highest-impact items (VERSION_CONTROL and TESTING) so we can obtain a reliable verification baseline and then iterate small fixes.

1. Immediate: Clean & synchronize git (VERSION_CONTROL)
   - Commit or discard the unstaged modifications and push the local commits so the branch is synchronized.
     - Example actions:
       - git add package.json package-lock.json .voder/* || selectively add changed files
       - git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): persist dependency and metadata changes"
       - git push origin main
   - Rationale: A clean, pushed branch is required before re-running verification and publishing consistent status to CI/history.

2. Re-run verification pipeline to reveal the first blocking error (TESTING / EXECUTION)
   - Run locally and capture full console output:
     - npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test
   - Rationale: This produces the concrete failure to fix next. The earlier Vitest failure (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for vite-plugin-inline-source) was the first blocker; re-running now will confirm whether the guarded vite.config.ts resolved it or whether further action (installing optional plugin or adjusting runtime path) is required.

3. Fix the first blocking runtime/test error (one focused commit)
   - If Vitest still fails due to optional plugin resolution, pick one small remediation:
     - Ensure the runtime vite.config.ts used by Vitest is the guarded version (no silent generated config referencing the missing plugin), OR
     - Install the optional plugin as devDependency if required by the generated config path (prefer guarded approach first), OR
     - Adjust Vitest/Vite invocation so temporary/generated configs do not require the optional plugin.
   - Re-run the verification pipeline after the focused fix and repeat until the verification pipeline runs through tests (or at least until the first failing test is stable and actionable).

4. After verification passes or first blocking errors are resolved:
   - Implement the minimal missing packaging test and export map:
     - Add a package.json "main" / "types" / "exports" map pointing to dist/ (small change).
     - Add tests: tests/package-structure.test.ts and tests/package-exports.test.ts to validate exports resolve to dist.
   - Implement the required tests incrementally for highest-impact features (export-structure, smoke tests), then implement key missing factories (createViteLibraryConfig, createVitestJsdomConfig) one small slice at a time, each followed by verification.

5. Documentation and housekeeping (parallel or after tests pass)
   - Add README.md, CHANGELOG.md (template), and short contributor/instruction section showing verification commands and Node engine requirements.
   - Run `npm audit` and address critical advisories.

Why this ordering
- Cleaning git and re-running the verification pipeline gives deterministic, reproducible failure output (console-first, captured in history) that allows small, focused remediation commits. Fixing tests and packaging exports early unlocks the ability to add the broader test suite and the remaining implementations with confidence.

If you want, I can:
- (A) stage and commit the pending changes and push for you (I will only output the commands and the exact changes I will make first), or
- (B) run the verification command now and capture the full stdout/stderr so we can plan the first focused remediation commit.

Which of (A) or (B) should I do next?



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (25% ±10% COMPLETE)
- Implemented / Working (core, minimal features)
  - PostCSS factory: createPostCSSConfig and PostCSSConfigOptions are implemented in source and exposed by src/index.ts; compiled dist artifacts for this export exist. This satisfies the "CSS Processing: PostCSS + Autoprefixer" requirement in a minimal, testable form.
  - TypeScript build basics: tsconfig.json, "build" and "type-check" scripts in package.json, and declaration generation are configured. The project compiles the minimal source and produces dist/.
  - Basic packaging metadata: package.json, license, type:module, and dev/peer dependency entries are present and reasonably aligned with the ADRs.
  - Documentation/ADRs: Decision records and package-level documentation exist (lots of ADRs and docs), which covers intended design and decisions.

- Partially implemented
  - Tests: There is at least one unit test created earlier for PostCSS (per history), and vitest is present as a devDependency. However the full test matrix required by the guides (export-integration, package-structure tests, smoke tests, installation integration tests, 90%+ coverage rules) is not in place or enforced.
  - Build / dist visibility: dist/ artifacts exist and are visible to the LLM (via .voderignore), but the package.json does not implement the full dual-export/exports map required by the Universal Guide (main/types/exports pointing at dist/). That means the mandated export-integration tests and consumer import patterns are not fully supported yet.
  - Dev tooling installed: many devDependencies required by the guides are present (vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, markdownlint-cli2, testing libraries), but the package scripts and glue to run the standardized verify/lint:md/format flows are not implemented (verify, lint:md, lint:md:fix, format, lint, lint:fix, etc. missing or incomplete).

- Missing / Not implemented (major required features)
  - Vite library config factory: createViteLibraryConfig (src/build/vite-library.ts) is specified in the design but not present in the repository source exports (only PostCSS is exported). The Vite factory is required by the package scope and usage examples.
  - Testing utilities: jsdom/Vitest configuration factory, DOM testing helpers, accessibility testing utilities, and test environment setup (src/testing/*) are not implemented or exported in current source. These are core responsibilities of @voder/ui-tools.
  - Linting configs: HTML/CSS/accessibility linting factory functions and exports (src/linting/*) required by the package are not implemented in source (only present in the design docs).
  - Templates: example vitest/vite/test-setup templates are referenced in design but not present in repo src/templates as functioning artifacts.
  - Scripts & mandated workflows: The Universal Guide mandates standardized scripts (verify, lint:md, lint:md:fix, format, format:check, lint, lint:fix, test:ci) and prepare/voder scripts; package.json currently has only minimal scripts and lacks many required script entries (e.g., lint:md, lint:md:fix, verify, format).
  - Package export map: required dual-export strategy (main, types, exports map to dist/ and config .ts files) is not present, so consumers cannot rely on dedicated paths per guide.
  - Mandatory tests & coverage requirements: The universal testing standards (export-equivalence, package-exports, package-structure, smoke tests, 90% coverage minimum) are not implemented. No automated enforcement of vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8 alignment test exists.
  - Prettier config & markdown lint generation: prettier.config.ts and script to generate .markdownlint.json from @voder/dev-config are absent.
  - Accessibility / HTML/CSS linters' peer dependency enforcement and functional integration are missing.
  - Many example usage files (e.g., templates and component test examples) are absent.

- Risk / Blocking items for "functional completeness"
  - The package only implements a single functional feature (PostCSS autoprefixer config). The rest of the package responsibilities (build config factory, testing tooling, linting factories, export maps, verification scripts, and comprehensive tests) are unimplemented.
  - Even where devDependencies exist, the runtime/test startup has exhibited failures in the past (vite temp config error) indicating further runtime fragility until optional plugin imports and test configuration are hardened.

Summary conclusion
- The repository currently implements a single, small functional slice (PostCSS configuration). That covers a meaningful, required subset of the stated responsibilities, but the majority of required features (Vite library factory, jsdom testing utilities, accessibility helpers, linting configs, standardized scripts, dual exports, and mandatory tests) are not implemented. Functionally this is an early-stage scaffold with one working feature — roughly 15–35% of the full requested feature set.

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (60% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The codebase shows a clear, consistent ESM/TypeScript style and some good practices (strict TypeScript settings, explicit .js import extensions for ESM output, guarded dynamic plugin loading in vite.config.ts). However there are several notable issues that reduce confidence in correctness and maintainability: (1) package.json is missing packaging entry points (no "main", "types", or "exports" map) which breaks the expected consumer/export contract and will fail any package export integration tests; (2) there is an apparent disconnect between built artifacts in dist/ and the TypeScript sources (the barrel in src/index.ts re-exports ./build/postcss.js but the corresponding src/build/postcss.ts is not present in the provided snapshot — if that file is missing the build/type-check will fail); (3) duplicate declarations of the same modules in peerDependencies and devDependencies (autoprefixer, jsdom, jest-axe, etc.) create potential versioning/confusion risks and should be intentional and documented via an ADR; (4) the vite.config.ts error swallowing is defensive but overly silent — it may mask real plugin initialization bugs and should at least emit structured stderr warnings; (5) project-wide quality infrastructure is incomplete (no eslint.config.js, missing standardized lint/format scripts required by the guide, and sparse unit tests/export tests), so code-safety guarantees are weak; and (6) committed build artifacts (dist/) visible in the workspace can indicate process gaps. In summary: the core pieces show correct direction and some working parts, but critical packaging and test-contract gaps plus oversight around dependency declarations and silent error handling mean the code is not yet robust or ready for reliable consumption.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (15% ±10% COMPLETE)
- Current test surface: There is evidence (in the work history) of at least one unit test being added for the PostCSS factory (postcss.test.ts), and the package.json contains Vitest scripts (test, test:watch, test:ci). However, in the current repository snapshot there are effectively only a minimal test presence — the comprehensive test suites required by the Universal Guide (package-structure, export-equivalence, package-installation integration, smoke tests, broad unit/integration coverage for build/testing/lint factories, accessibility helpers, etc.) are missing or incomplete.
- Test execution: The last verification run did not complete: Vitest startup was blocked by an ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for 'vite-plugin-inline-source' (thrown by a generated Vite temp config), so tests were not allowed to run to completion. A guarded vite.config.ts was later introduced to swallow optional plugin import errors, but that fix has not yet been re-verified by re-running the full verification pipeline. Therefore there is no evidence that tests currently pass in this repo state.
- Coverage: No coverage report is available. The project policy requires high thresholds (>=90% overall and 100% public API coverage). Given the tiny/partial test suite and the failed test run, coverage requirements are not satisfied at all.
- Gaps vs. requirements:
  - Missing mandatory test categories from the Universal Guide: package-structure.test.ts, export-equivalence.test.ts, smoke tests, package-installation integration tests, and vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 alignment tests.
  - Missing broad unit tests for Vite factory, Vitest jsdom factory, DOM helpers, accessibility utilities, and lint-config factories.
  - No automated tests enforcing dependency/version alignment mandated by ADRs (e.g., vitest vs @vitest/coverage-v8).
- Recommendation (next verification step): Re-run the verification pipeline now (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) to capture current test output. If the vite-plugin import error still occurs, ensure the guarded vite.config.ts is in the runtime path used by Vitest (and that no other configs require the missing plugin), then re-run tests. After that, expand tests to include the mandatory integration and structure tests specified in the Universal Guide.
- Verdict: Testing is currently nascent and not passing in practice. Substantial work is needed to reach the project's testing standards and coverage requirements.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (60% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Type-check and build: SUCCESS — tsc type-check and compilation completed and emitted dist/ artifacts (dist/src/index.js and .d.ts present).
- Test verification: INCOMPLETE/FAILED — Vitest startup previously failed with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for the optional plugin "vite-plugin-inline-source" (error came from a generated Vite temp config), which prevented the test run from completing.
- Mitigation applied but not yet verified — a guarded vite.config.ts was committed to swallow missing-plugin import/init failures; however the full verification pipeline (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) has not been re-run since that change, so test execution remains unvalidated.
- Additional state: package.json/package-lock.json were modified during dependency installs (some changes appear unstaged in the working tree), and the branch is ahead of origin/main by 1 commit.

Summary: The build stage is working (TS compile + dist output), but end-to-end verification is not complete because test execution failed earlier and has not yet been re-run after the focused remediation. To reach full execution success, run the verification pipeline now (or install the optional plugin) and confirm Vitest completes.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (30% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Strengths:
  - ADRs / decision records are well represented under docs/decisions/ (local and inherited ADRs). That gives good architectural rationale and traceability.
  - A usage doc exists for @voder/dev-config (docs/libraries/usage/voder-dev-config.md) which is thorough and includes quick-start, API snippets, troubleshooting and security notes — useful as an example of the intended style.
  - The prompts and implementation guidance files (prompts/*.md) capture intended APIs, structure, and example code for the package implementation (helpful for maintainers/LLM authors).
  - Inline comments and example snippets in the prompts and docs provide many usage examples and expectations for tests and scripts.

- Gaps / Problems (high priority)
  - No package README.md at package root (or in packages/ui-tools): consumers and registry views will not have a self-contained public README with installation, quick start, API summary, license/security posture per the Universal Guide.
  - No published API reference or generated docs (no src-level API docs, no doc site links) — exported functions/types are not documented in a consumer-facing README or API doc.
  - No CHANGELOG.md present (template recommended by guide is missing).
  - package.json exports/dual-export strategy is referenced in docs but package.json lacks a formal exports map and README documenting the actual public surface and import paths.
  - Tests are described in the guides, but there is no “How to run tests / verify” README section for contributors specific to this package (scripts exist, but not documented per-package README).
  - The docs mandate standardized markdown linting and scripts (lint:md, lint:md:fix, prepare), but those scripts/config generation steps are not documented in a package README nor is the .markdownlint.json generation script present in the repo root for this package.
  - Missing consumer-focused usage examples for @voder/ui-tools — the prompts contain examples, but they are not present in a consumer-facing README or docs directory for this package.
  - No CHANGELOG, no contribution guidelines specific to this package (though global guidance exists in prompts).
  - README isolation rules (no internal links) require a self-contained README; that is currently absent.

- Recommendations (concrete next steps, small focused changes)
  1. Add a self-contained README.md in the package root that follows the provided README template:
     - Purpose, compatibility (Node engine), installation, quick-start examples, public API surface, scripts (how to run type-check/build/test/verify), security posture, license (UNLICENSED).
  2. Add a brief API reference section (short examples for the primary exported factories: createPostCSSConfig, and planned createViteLibraryConfig/createVitestJsdomConfig) in README.
  3. Add CHANGELOG.md (use template) and a short CONTRIBUTING or short contributor notes with commands to run the verification pipeline.
  4. Document package.json scripts and the expectation to run NODE >= 22.6.0 (if applicable) in README.
  5. Ensure .markdownlint generation instructions (or a small script) and lint:md / lint:md:fix script docs are present in README so maintainers know how to generate/validate docs.
  6. Optionally add a docs/usage/ or examples/ directory with runnable snippets for vite.config.ts and vitest.config.ts usage (keeps README concise but provides executable examples).

- Overall: while the repository contains strong architectural ADRs and implementation guidance (excellent for maintainers/LLM agents), it lacks the consumer-facing and package-specific documentation that users and contributors expect (README, API summary, changelog, examples). Completing the README plus a small API/examples doc will move documentation from sparse to usable quickly.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (75% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall: The dependency set looks intentionally modern and coherent (TypeScript 5.x, Vitest 3.2.4 aligned with @vitest/coverage-v8 3.2.4, jsdom/autoprefixer/postcss present). The project follows the ADRs that require exact Vitest/provider alignment and peer/dev separation, and that is reflected in package.json (vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 are matched). That is a strong positive for compatibility and deterministic test runs.
- Freshness: Many core tools are recent (typescript ^5.9.2, vitest ^3.2.4). Some entries (postcss ^8.x, autoprefixer ^10.x) are on older major lines but still widely used and compatible with many toolchains; their minor versions in devDependencies (autoprefixer ^10.4.21, postcss ^8.5.6) indicate maintenance updates on the same major line. Vite is listed as a peer (^6.0.0) — that targets a future major line; ensure consumers install a compatible Vite version.
- Compatibility: The deliberate alignment of vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 mitigates peer dependency runtime failures. Duplicate tooling appearing in peerDependencies and devDependencies (e.g., autoprefixer/postcss listed as peers and devs) is typical for tooling packages (peer for consumers, dev for developing this package) but should be kept under ADR oversight.
- Security posture: I cannot run audits here, so I cannot guarantee there are no known vulnerabilities. Historically, ecosystem packages like postcss and some transitive deps have had security advisories (e.g., prototype pollution issues in older PostCSS/related tooling). Because postcss is on the v8 major line, you should run an `npm audit` / Snyk/OSS scan to confirm there are no high/critical advisories affecting the exact installed versions. Likewise run `npm outdated` to see upgrade candidates.
- Notable points / risks to verify immediately:
  - Run `npm audit` and `npm outdated` to discover any known vulnerabilities and upgrade opportunities.
  - Confirm consumer-facing peer ranges are appropriate (vite ^6, postcss ^8, autoprefixer ^10, vitest ^3.2.0, etc.). Vite ^6 is a forward-looking peer; if consumers use older Vite, that could cause friction.
  - Ensure no transitive packages (introduced by markdownlint-cli2, jsdom, testing libs) have outstanding critical advisories.
  - The peer/dev mismatch for jest-axe (peer ^9.0.0 vs dev ^10.0.0) is not inherently a problem for package development but may produce warnings for consumers — consider documenting or aligning if intentional.
  - Keep the exact vitest/provider alignment test in CI (as ADR prescribes) to prevent runtime errors.
- Recommendation: Execute `npm audit --json` and `npm outdated --json` locally (or in CI) to get actionable upgrade/audit information, then address any critical/high advisories as a priority. Given the current visible state and alignment effort, the dependency situation appears healthy but requires the standard automated audits to be confident.

Score explanation: 75% indicates generally good, intentional dependency choices and compatibility alignment (notably Vitest/provider), but lacking live audit/upgrade checks here prevents a full confidence rating. Run `npm audit`/`npm outdated` to move toward 90–100% confidence.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary: The source code itself contains minimal direct security vulnerabilities (no use of eval, no direct network calls, no plaintext secret handling, no obvious unsafe filesystem writes). The main security exposure vectors are supply‑chain and execution-of-arbitrary-scripts risks introduced by dev/prepare scripts and third‑party dependencies used during development/test/build. Recommendations below prioritize mitigation of those risks.

Findings (issues, risks, and rationale)
- Supply‑chain risk from devDependencies/peerDependencies
  - Many devDependencies (vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, jsdom, postcss, autoprefixer, markdownlint-cli2, jest-axe, etc.) are installed and referenced. Malicious or compromised packages in the dependency tree are the primary attack surface for this repo.
  - The repo uses a package-lock.json (good) but commits to lockfile changes were made; ensure lockfile integrity and provenance are enforced (use npm ci in CI, audit lockfile before installs).
  - Recommendation: run regular `npm audit` and dependency scans, pin or use lockfile-based installs in CI (npm ci), enforce automated supply-chain checks (SBOM, SLSA, vulnerability scanners).

- Execution of repository-local scripts during install (prepare)
  - package.json defines a "prepare" script: node ../../setup-package-docs.js — running code from relative parent paths during npm install could execute arbitrary JS (if that script or its parents are compromised or altered). This is a risk for contributors or CI systems that run installs.
  - Similarly, the "voder" script references a relative CLI path. While acceptable for monorepo internal tooling, any consumer that runs `npm install` or scripts may execute code from repo-relative paths.
  - Recommendation: minimize or document the effects of prepare; ensure prepare scripts are safe/no-op when running in untrusted contexts; run prepare only in trusted CI; consider gating prepare to an explicit script or check for environment variable indicating allowed execution.

- Use of execSync and child_process in tests/documentation examples
  - Tests and example integration tests (in docs/prompts) use execSync to run `npm pack`, `node`, and `npm install` in temp directories. execSync is fine when arguments are controlled, but executing shell commands from tests could be dangerous if any inputs can be influenced by untrusted data.
  - Recommendation: ensure command arguments are not constructed from untrusted input and use safe APIs (spawn with args array) or proper sanitization. Limit such tests to CI/trusted environments.

- Dynamic plugin import in vite.config.ts
  - vite.config.ts dynamically imports an optionally installed plugin ('vite-plugin-inline-source') and swallows import/init errors. This is tolerant but means that if the optional plugin exists in node_modules it will be executed during Vite startup; a malicious plugin in node_modules could run code in the developer environment.
  - Recommendation: trust only vetted plugins; prefer locking plugin versions and auditing them. Consider explicit allowlist of optional plugins.

- Potential accidental exposure of internal metadata
  - The repository contains many `.voder/*` metadata files that may contain operational history. Ensure no secrets are stored there. .gitignore already excludes .env — verify other tracked metadata files do not contain credentials or tokens.
  - Recommendation: scan repo (and history) for secrets, add secret scanning to CI.

- Testing/coverage tools that rely on native or external binaries
  - Some tools (node modules or coverage providers) may include native code or spawn system commands. Keep an eye on vulnerabilities reported for these packages.
  - Recommendation: keep devDependencies up to date and monitor advisories.

- Node.js / experimental flags and runtime compatibility
  - Project (and inherited ADRs) expect Node >=22.6. Use of experimental flags (e.g., `--experimental-strip-types`) is noted in docs for Prettier config. Experimental features may have unexpected behavior but are not direct security issues; still verify that scripts that depend on these flags are not exposing unsafe behavior.
  - Recommendation: document runtime requirements clearly and ensure CI uses pinned Node versions.

- Repo publish policy and "private": true
  - package.json sets "private": true and license UNLICENSED — reduces accidental public publish risk. Good.
  - Recommendation: keep "private": true for internal packages and enforce CI gating to prevent accidental publish commands.

Low-probability / lower-severity items
- File-writing behavior
  - Code samples demonstrate writing files (tests creating temp directories, scripts that generate .markdownlint.json). The project policy strongly discourages writing repo files for outputs, and .gitignore largely covers outputs. Ensure all code writing to disk uses OS temp directories, and never writes untrusted content into repo paths.
- No obvious injection or XSS in code
  - UI testing utilities use safe DOM APIs (textContent vs innerHTML in examples), and usage appears mindful of XSS. Continue to enforce safe patterns where user-provided content could be inserted into DOM in tests/examples.

Actionable mitigations (prioritized, small steps)
1. Run dependency audits and add automated dependency scanning in CI (npm audit, Snyk/OSS-Fuzz/etc.). Regenerate lockfile with known-good versions and prefer `npm ci` in CI.
2. Review and document all lifecycle scripts (prepare, voder). If prepare must run on install, ensure it is safe/no-op for untrusted environments; otherwise require an explicit opt-in.
3. Add a secret-scan and static-analysis step to CI and run locally to ensure `.voder/` files contain no secrets.
4. Pin/lock optional plugin versions used at build time or add an allowlist for optional plugins to reduce risk from malicious packages in node_modules.
5. For tests that execSync external commands, centralize and sanitize command invocation, and mark such tests as integration-only to run in controlled CI environments.
6. Maintain the package-lock.json in source control and do not edit it manually; prefer lockfile-based installs for reproducible environments.

Confidence note: This assessment focuses on the repository snapshot and visible source/metadata. It does not include an exhaustive vulnerability scan of transitive dependencies or runtime behavior in CI — those need automated tooling to fully confirm. The estimated completion reflects analysis of available files, not external advisories or full supply-chain scans.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, synchronized state and therefore far from being publish-ready. There are both uncommitted modifications and local commits that are ahead of the remote.
- Uncommitted changes: The working tree shows modified files (not staged) including several .voder metadata files and key package metadata (package.json, package-lock.json). Because there are unstaged/modified files, this alone limits completeness to a maximum ~30%.
- Unpushed commits: The branch is reported as "ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit." That means there is at least one local commit not yet synchronized with the remote; this further reduces the confidence/synchronization (max ~50% if only this were the issue).
- File tracking / ignore patterns: .gitignore appears correctly configured for build outputs (dist/, coverage/, caches) and no important build outputs appear tracked (git ls-files dist returned nothing). No untracked important files were reported. That is positive for file tracking and repository hygiene.
- Clean working state: Because both unstaged/modified files exist AND there is an unpushed commit, the repository cannot be considered clean or fully synchronized.

Summary diagnosis and next minimal actions to reach a clean state:
1. Inspect and either stage and commit or discard the modified files (especially package.json / package-lock.json changes and .voder metadata). Example:
   - git add package.json package-lock.json .voder/* && git commit -m "chore: persist metadata and dependency changes"
2. Push local commits:
   - git push origin main
3. Re-run git status to confirm "working tree clean" and branch synchronized.

Score rationale: presence of uncommitted changes caps completeness at ~30%; presence of unpushed commits also indicates a synchronization problem — combined, current state is approximately 25% complete (±5%).
