Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (49% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What’s complete
  - Core PostCSS factory implemented and exported (createPostCSSConfig). TypeScript compilation works and produced dist artifacts. (FUNCTIONALITY: 18%)
  - Build/type-check scripts run successfully; tsc configuration is corrected to NodeNext and declaration output is enabled. (EXECUTION: 60%)
  - Dependency set is modern and intentionally aligned for the test toolchain (vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8). Security posture shows good practices and known supply‑chain considerations. (DEPENDENCIES: 75%, SECURITY: 80%)
  - Internal documentation/ADRs are thorough and abundant (docs/decisions/, prompts). (DOCUMENTATION: 40%)

- What’s missing or broken (high-impact)
  - Large portions of the @voder/ui-tools API surface required by the guide are unimplemented: createViteLibraryConfig, testing utilities (vitest-jsdom, helpers, accessibility, setup), linting config factories, templates, and utils are absent. The export barrel only exposes PostCSS. (FUNCTIONALITY: 18%)
  - Tests are sparse and not covering the mandatory suites. Vitest previously failed to start due to an environment/plugin issue; a guard was added but tests have not been re‑run to confirm success. Coverage is far below the required thresholds. (TESTING: 30%)
  - Version control state is not clean: multiple modified .voder metadata files are unstaged/uncommitted and build outputs appear committed (dist/ present despite .gitignore). This prevents a reproducible, publishable state. (VERSION_CONTROL: 30%)
  - Some code-quality and packaging issues: missing consumer-facing package exports (main/types/exports), missing mandatory scripts (lint:md, verify, format), and at least one missing devDependency for the test environment (e.g., '@testing-library/jest-dom' expected by setup). (CODE_QUALITY: 60%)
  - Public, consumer-facing documentation (README, CHANGELOG, usage examples) and package.json export mapping are incomplete. (DOCUMENTATION: 40%)

- Key numbers / references from sub-assessments
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 18% — only the PostCSS factory and minimal exports are implemented; most APIs and tests are missing.
  - CODE_QUALITY: 60% — compiles; defensive vite guard added; dependency declarations and packaging need cleanup; missing test helper dependency observed.
  - TESTING: 30% — only a small unit test exists; Vitest startup previously failed; no coverage reports; required test suites absent.
  - EXECUTION: 60% — tsc/build succeeded; full verification pipeline not yet proven successful (tests blocked previously).
  - DOCUMENTATION: 40% — strong internal ADRs, but missing public README, API docs, and generated markdown-lint wiring.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 75% — versions look intentional and aligned; run `npm audit` recommended; minor peer/dev misalignments (e.g., jest-axe) should be reconciled.
  - SECURITY: 80% — good hygiene overall but supply‑chain risks and lifecycle script exposure warrant audit and mitigations.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 30% — unstaged modified tracked files and committed build outputs break the clean repo requirement.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Based on lowest-scoring areas (FUNCTIONALITY, VERSION_CONTROL, TESTING), the highest priority is to restore a clean, verifiable baseline so the verification pipeline can run and further incremental work can proceed. Do exactly one focused change first:

1. Restore version-control cleanliness (immediate blocker)
   - Commit the modified .voder metadata files as-is so the working tree becomes clean, and remove committed dist/ artifacts from the index so .gitignore can take effect.
     - Actions (non-interactive commands you would run locally):
       - git add .voder/history.md .voder/implementation-progress.md .voder/last-action.md .voder/plan.md .voder/progress-chart.png .voder/progress-log-areas.csv .voder/progress-log.csv && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): persist .voder metadata updates" && git push origin main
       - git rm -r --cached dist/ || true && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): untrack build outputs (dist/) from repository" || true && git push origin main
   - Rationale: a clean, synchronized repo is required before running the verification pipeline and adding further commits; committed build outputs and unstaged tracked metadata currently block reproducible verification.

2. Fix immediate test-environment dependency issues (next, then re-run verification)
   - Add the missing test helper dependency used by setup (e.g., @testing-library/jest-dom) to devDependencies and install so Vitest setup imports succeed.
     - Command: npm install --no-audit --no-fund --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom
   - Rationale: tests previously failed to start due to environment/module errors. Fixing missing dev deps reduces false failures and lets the test suite run.

3. Run the full verification pipeline (after steps 1–2)
   - Command: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test
   - Use the full console output to plan a single focused remediation if failures remain.

Why this order:
- Version-control cleanliness is an absolute prerequisite (tests, builds, and packaging verification rely on a clean working tree and consistent history).
- Fixing the immediate test runtime dependency is the smallest, highest-impact code change to allow tests to run and reveal real functionality gaps.
- Once the pipeline runs, iterate on one focused remediation at a time (implement createViteLibraryConfig, then testing helpers, then linting factories, then packaging/exports and corresponding tests).

If you want, I can:
- Produce the exact git/npm commands to run next, or
- Make the single remediation commit (e.g., add @testing-library/jest-dom) and prepare the repository changes required to get a successful verification run — but I will only make one focused change at a time as requested. Which should I do next: (A) prepare and show the necessary git commands for you to run locally, or (B) produce the single remediation commit to add the missing test dependency and update package.json here?



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (18% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Implemented
  - PostCSS factory: createPostCSSConfig implemented in src/build/postcss.ts and exported from src/index.ts. This core piece for CSS preprocessing (PostCSS + Autoprefixer) exists and is compiled into dist/.
  - TypeScript configuration: tsconfig.json is present, configured for NodeNext, strict mode, declaration output to dist/.
  - Basic package metadata: package.json exists with sensible name/description/type, devDependencies and peerDependencies that align with ADRs.
  - Minimal build/test scripts: type-check, build, test, test:ci, clean, prepare, voder scripts are present.
  - Some ADRs and documentation: multiple decision records are present under docs/decisions/, documenting design choices required by the guide.
  - A unit test was added for PostCSS (per history), and dist/ contains compiled artifacts for the exported PostCSS API.

- Partially implemented / present but incomplete
  - Export barrel: src/index.ts exports only the PostCSS API. The export barrel exists but is far from the full set required by the package guide.
  - Vite config guarding: vite.config.ts was guarded against an optional plugin (mitigates a startup error), but the package-level createViteLibraryConfig factory (src/build/vite-library.ts) required by the guide is not present.
  - Some .voder metadata is tracked and persisted; the console-first policy is being followed in workflow metadata, but these files do not substitute for package functionality.

- Missing / not implemented (major gaps)
  - Vite library configuration factory: createViteLibraryConfig (src/build/vite-library.ts) is not implemented; required for library build configuration slice.
  - Testing utilities: vitest jsdom config factory, test setup, DOM helpers, accessibility helpers (src/testing/*) are not present or not exported—described in the guide but not implemented.
  - Accessibility integration: jest-axe-based helpers and matchers are specified in the guide but not implemented.
  - Linting configurations: HTML, CSS, accessibility lint factories (src/linting/*) are missing.
  - Dual export strategy / package exports: package.json does not define "main", "types", or "exports" pointing to dist/ as required for configuration packages; tests that verify package export paths are not present.
  - Comprehensive tests: The guide mandates a broad set of Vitest tests (export-equivalence, package-structure, package-installation integration, smoke tests, coverage thresholds, version-alignment tests). Only a single PostCSS-related unit test exists (at best). Coverage/thresholds, V8 coverage provider tests, and package-structure tests are missing.
  - Scripts mandated by the universal guide: verify, lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix, and the required prepare behavior to generate .markdownlint.json are not implemented (prepare exists but setup script not present).
  - Prettier config (prettier.config.ts): referenced in tsconfig include, but no prettier.config.ts file exists.
  - ESLint config integration: eslint.config.js and Prettier exports from @voder/dev-config are not present as required.
  - Packaging/integration testing automation: package-installation.test.ts and other integration tests are not implemented.
  - Mandatory quality thresholds and coverage (90%+, public API coverage) are not met — no evidence of coverage or broad testing.
  - Many source files referenced by the implementation guide (src/build/vite-library.ts, src/testing/*, src/linting/*, templates/, utils/) are missing.

- Risk/compatibility notes affecting functionality
  - The codebase had an earlier Vitest startup failure caused by a missing optional Vite plugin; vite.config.ts was guarded to avoid a test-time crash. This indicates some test startup brittleness and that generated Vite temp configs (node_modules/.vite-temp) may be environment-dependent and caused prior failures.
  - Dist is present and visible via .voderignore, but the package.json does not yet reference compiled dist outputs via "main"/"exports" so consumers/import resolution tests cannot be run yet.

- Overall assessment
  - The repository contains a correct, focused implementation of a single core piece (PostCSS + autoprefixer factory) plus scaffolding, docs, ADRs, and some build/test scripts. However, the package is far from delivering the complete @voder/ui-tools feature set described in the guides:
    - Missing the Vite library config factory and the entire testing, accessibility, linting, templating, and export/integration test suites.
    - Required packaging exports, verify scripts, and documentation wiring are not implemented.
  - Functionality is therefore low: the project has a working building block but lacks the majority of required APIs, tests, and packaging/export behavior required by the specification.

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (60% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The TypeScript build configuration and minimal export barrel are mostly correct: tsconfig uses NodeNext, declarations are enabled, and the source barrel preserves .js import extensions for ESM output. tsc and build previously completed after fixes, which indicates the core compile path is functional.
- Problems that reduce overall quality and will cause runtime/test failures:
  - Missing runtime test helper dependency: src/testing/setup.ts imports '@testing-library/jest-dom' but package.json only lists '@testing-library/dom' (no '@testing-library/jest-dom'). This will break test startup (module not found / failing environment hooks).
  - package.json is incomplete for a compiled package: there are no "main", "types", or "exports" fields pointing at dist/, yet dist/ contains compiled files. The repo should follow the dual-export/packaging strategy (exports -> ./dist/…). This mismatch will break consumer import expectations and the package-structure tests required by policy.
  - Build outputs are present in the repository (dist/src/*). The repository policy/guide strongly prohibits committed build artifacts; tracked dist files cause policy and packaging confusion and suggest git state inconsistencies (there was an attempted git rm --cached that failed). This is a process/quality problem and can mask mismatches between source and built artifacts.
  - package.json has overlapping/ambiguous dependency declarations: several packages appear in both peerDependencies and devDependencies (e.g., vitest, postcss, autoprefixer). While sometimes intentional (dev install + peer for consumers), the current mix and some version mismatches (peer vs dev) are potentially confusing and should be justified or cleaned up in ADRs.
  - Scripts required by the universal guide are missing or incomplete: mandatory markdown lint scripts (lint:md / lint:md:fix) and the recommended verify/lint/format script patterns are absent. That reduces automation and makes quality gates non-standard for this package.
  - Some source imports reference types or packages that may not be present in devDependencies (e.g., IComponent from '@voder/shared'); if those types are not available in the monorepo workspace, builds/tests may fail or be brittle.
  - Minor style/format issues (leading spaces, inconsistent comment formatting) are present in src/index.ts, but these are low-severity and typically fixed by Prettier/format scripts.
  - The repo contains numerous modified .voder metadata files showing uncommitted tracked changes — not a code bug per se, but it indicates working-tree state complexity that can interfere with reproducible runs.
- Positives:
  - Core factory API (PostCSS config export) exists and dist contains corresponding runtime artifacts, and TypeScript compile has been exercised successfully.
  - Vite config is guarded to avoid failing when an optional plugin is not installed — defensive programming that reduced a previously observed startup failure.
- Recommendations (focus on highest-impact fixes):
  1. Add '@testing-library/jest-dom' to devDependencies to fix test environment imports.
  2. Add proper package.json "main", "types", and "exports" mapping to point at dist/ files (and ensure build produces those paths).
  3. Remove committed dist/ files from the repo (git rm --cached if needed) and ensure .gitignore covers dist/ (then rebuild artifacts locally as needed); this restores clean source-only VCS state.
  4. Harmonize peer/dev dependency declarations and add the mandatory lint:md scripts per the project guide.
  5. Run the verify pipeline (type-check → build → tests) and address any remaining failing tests (likely around jsdom/test setup and missing packages).
- Overall: the codebase is in a partially working state (compiles) but has several actionable issues that will block tests and packaging validation. Fixing the dependency and packaging/script issues will substantially increase reliability and adherence to the project's quality standards.

<scratchpad>
- Check repository evidence: package.json has vitest devDependency and test scripts; devDeps include @vitest/coverage-v8.
- History notes: a PostCSS unit test was added (tests/build/postcss.test.ts). Build and type-check passed earlier, but Vitest failed due to ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for optional 'vite-plugin-inline-source' from a generated temp vite.config; a guarded import change was committed to mitigate that.
- Current working-tree shows .voder metadata modified but no recent successful full test run recorded. The failure prevented tests from completing previously.
- Required testing policy (from universal guide) is extensive: many mandatory test categories (package-structure, export-equivalence, package-installation, smoke tests, coverage ≥90% etc.). Only a small subset (PostCSS factory test) appears implemented.
- Coverage: no successful coverage report available; minimal tests cannot meet 90% threshold.
- Conclusion: tests exist but are sparse; they were not all passing (Vitest startup error); coverage is far below required thresholds.
</scratchpad>

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (30% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- There are some unit tests (notably a PostCSS factory unit test) and the project has Vitest and coverage tooling configured, but the test surface is very limited compared to the mandated suite (missing export-equivalence, package-structure, package-installation, smoke, many integration and accessibility tests). The most recent verification run failed to complete because Vitest startup hit a module-not-found error (optional vite plugin), so tests have not been fully exercised end-to-end in the current tree. No coverage report was produced; given the small number of tests, code coverage is far below the required 90% threshold. Overall: basic test scaffolding exists, but tests are incomplete and not reliably passing — substantial additional tests and at least one re-run of the verification pipeline are needed.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (60% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Type-check and TypeScript build have succeeded, and compiled artifacts exist in dist/. However the full verification pipeline did not complete: Vitest test startup previously failed with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for the optional plugin 'vite-plugin-inline-source'. A guarded vite.config.ts was added to swallow missing-plugin import errors, but the verification pipeline has not been re-run since that fix. In short: build scripts work, but tests have not been fully validated end-to-end yet.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (40% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains strong internal decision documentation (ADRs in docs/decisions/) and comprehensive developer-guides/prompts (prompts/universal-guide.md and prompts/development-ui-tools.md) that thoroughly describe architecture, policies, and intended APIs. However, public‑facing and package‑specific documentation is incomplete: there is no package README.md or CHANGELOG in the package root, no concise API reference for the exported runtime surface (what consumers import from @voder/ui-tools), no usage README targeted at consumers (installation, quick start, examples), and no generated markdownlint config or scripts documented for the package as required by the universal guide. Tests and examples referenced in the guides are partially missing or only present as plans. In short: excellent internal design/docs/ADRs, but missing the consumer‑facing README, API docs, examples, changelog, and the smaller automation docs needed to meet the project's publishing/consumption expectations.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (75% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall: dependencies look reasonably up-to-date and intentionally aligned for the test toolchain (TypeScript 5.9.x, Vitest 3.2.4 + @vitest/coverage-v8 3.2.4, jsdom 26.x, Vite ^6). The project follows the ADRs’ guidance (vitest/coverage provider aligned). However, I cannot run an automated vulnerability scan here — for a definitive security posture you must run `npm audit` / SCA tooling and review transitive results.
- Freshness: Most pinned majors are modern for the 2024–2025 timeframe (TS 5.x, Vitest 3.x, jsdom 26). Some packages (autoprefixer/postcss/stylelint ecosystem) are on older 8/10 lines by major but are still commonly used and maintained; they may have later patch/minor releases available.
- Security risk surface (high‑level):
  - No obvious massively out‑of‑date majors, but packages that historically surface vulnerabilities (postcss, jsdom, vite ecosystem) should be audited. Transitive vulnerabilities are the main risk — run `npm audit` / a CVE scan to get concrete results.
  - Recommendation: run `npm audit` (and optionally an SCA tool like Snyk or GitHub Dependabot) and address any high/critical findings. Prefer patch/minor upgrades where possible; if a major upgrade is required, add an ADR and test accordingly.
- Compatibility / policy issues:
  - Vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 are correctly version-aligned (3.2.4), matching the ADR — good.
  - Minor mismatch: jest-axe is listed in peerDependencies as ^9.0.0 but devDependencies include ^10.0.0. That can cause consumer warnings or peer compatibility confusion; align peer and dev versions (prefer matching caret range) or justify the mismatch in an ADR.
  - Duplicated entries across peerDependencies and devDependencies (e.g., autoprefixer, postcss, jsdom) are expected for config packages, but ensure peer ranges reflect what consumers should install and that devDependencies used for testing are compatible with those ranges.
  - `@voder/dev-config` is a local file: dependency — ensure its declared peerDependencies are compatible with this package.
- Actionable next steps (high priority):
  1. Run `npm audit` and capture results; fix high/critical issues or create ADRs for required dependency upgrades.
  2. Normalize versions where consumers rely on peerDependencies (e.g., align jest-axe peer/dev versions).
  3. Run `npm outdated` and consider upgrading patch/minor releases (especially for postcss/autoprefixer, jsdom, vite) and re-run tests.
  4. Add automated periodic dependency checks in CI (SCA) and document any deliberate exact pins in ADRs.
- Summary judgement: dependency set is in good shape functionally and intentionally aligned for testing; however, without an audit run we cannot claim full security clearance — perform `npm audit`/SCA and address any findings, and align the noted peer/dev version mismatch (jest-axe).

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall posture: The codebase follows many good security practices for a tooling/configuration package (private package.json, .env excluded in .gitignore, prohibition on writing output files to repo, and emphasis on console-first diagnostics). No obvious remote-execution or credential leaks are visible in the tracked source files provided. However several areas present supply‑chain, runtime, and test-time risks that should be addressed or monitored.

- Supply‑chain & dependency risks
  - Dev dependencies are numerous and include tooling that has historically had vulnerabilities (PostCSS ecosystem, jsdom, vitest, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2, various stylelint plugins). The repository evidence shows dev dependencies were installed — run `npm audit` and review advisories; include regular automated audits in CI.
  - package.json sets "private": true (good — prevents accidental publish). If/when making packages public, remove or harden any prepare/install scripts.
  - The prepare script references ../../setup-package-docs.js (will run automatically on npm install in some flows). Running package lifecycle scripts that execute arbitrary JS is a supply‑chain risk — prefer `prepare` actions that are safe or guard them with checks, and avoid executing root-level arbitrary code for consumers.
  - Dynamic optional plugin loading in vite.config.ts (importing 'vite-plugin-inline-source' if present) will execute plugin initialization code at config load time. If an untrusted/compromised plugin is present in the environment, it could run arbitrary code. This is a normal risk for plugin-based toolchains — treat optional plugins as potentially executable and only install trusted plugins. Consider logging and limiting plugin loading to allowlisting known safe plugins.
  - Tests use spawn/execSync (npm pack, npm install) to create and install tarballs in temp directories. Running `npm install` on arbitrary tarballs will execute lifecycle scripts of the package and its dependencies (supply-chain risk). In test code, consider using `--ignore-scripts` or otherwise isolating execution, and ensure CI runs in an isolated environment.

- Test & runtime execution risks
  - The accessibility helper module calls `expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations)` at module import time. This mutates global test state as a side effect and may change test runtime behavior unexpectedly. It's not a direct security vulnerability, but side-effectful imports can cause confusion / test pollution; prefer an explicit registration function to avoid surprising global changes.
  - `renderComponent` delegates to component.mount(container). That exposes the package to whatever the consumer component does on mount (including DOM mutation, event listeners, or if the component accepts unsafe HTML, potential XSS in tests). Document that test helpers should only be used with trusted inputs; do not render untrusted HTML in tests without sanitization.
  - The setup test environment mocks global browser APIs using vi.fn; while standard practice, be careful that any mocked functions do not leak into production code or persist beyond test scope.

- File & repository hygiene risks
  - Dist files appear to be present in repo (dist/src/index.*). The project's policy expects dist/ to be gitignored; committed build outputs may contain sensitive artifacts or create confusion about the source of truth. Committed build artifacts increase risk of accidental disclosure. Ensure dist/ is removed from VCS and only produced transiently (git rm --cached if necessary).
  - .voder metadata files are tracked and may contain operational traces. Audit `.voder/*` contents for sensitive information (auth tokens, hostnames, private paths) before publishing any artifacts. The `.gitignore` properly excludes `.env`, which is good.

- Child processes / shell usage
  - Several code snippets and tests use `execSync`/child_process to run shell commands. Running external commands with strings can be vulnerable to injection if untrusted inputs are passed into command lines. In code/tests, ensure inputs are controlled and use arrays / spawn with argument lists where possible. Prefer Node APIs (fs, npm programmatic APIs) over shelling out when feasible.
  - Test helpers creating temp directories are good (use OS temp dir and cleanup), but ensure cleanup code runs on all test exit paths (current examples use rm with force — good).

- Configuration & runtime hardening
  - No engines field in package.json was found (docs recommend Node >=22.6.0). It’s recommended to specify `engines.node` to prevent running the TypeScript-based config files in unsupported Node versions.
  - Consider pinning critical dev tooling to exact versions (already done for vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8) and document the rationale in ADR files; tests should verify alignment. Ensure lockfile integrity and CI use `npm ci` to get deterministic installs.
  - `prettier.config.ts` / TypeScript config loading requires Node flags (`--experimental-strip-types`) per ADR — running without the flag could result in unexpected behaviour. This is an operational risk; CI and contributors must be informed and CI should set appropriate NODE_OPTIONS.

- Recommendations (actionable)
  - Run `npm audit` and address high/severe vulnerabilities; add automatic audit reporting in CI (already suggested in docs).
  - Avoid running lifecycle `prepare` scripts that execute arbitrary repo-level code for consumers; if needed, guard with environment checks and fail-safe behavior.
  - Limit dynamic plugin execution surface: document which optional plugins are safe to install, and consider allowlisting.
  - In tests that install or execute packages (npm pack/install), use `--ignore-scripts` or run installs in heavily isolated ephemeral environments to reduce supply-chain risk.
  - Remove committed build outputs (dist/) from repo history if possible and `git rm --cached` them; ensure .gitignore includes dist/.
  - Add `engines.node` to package.json to enforce Node version constraints for TypeScript config loading.
  - Replace global side-effecting test matcher registration with an explicit helper call (e.g., `registerA11yMatchers()`).
  - Continue to keep secrets out of tracked files; audit existing tracked metadata for sensitive data.

- Residual unknowns that affect completeness of this assessment
  - The precise dependency vulnerability status (needs `npm audit` / scanning of package-lock.json).
  - Contents of `.voder/*` tracked files (may contain secrets or operational data).
  - CI configuration and container runtime security posture (not present here).
  - Whether dist/ was intentionally committed or remains from prior steps (we observed dist files present).

Summary: No glaring code-level remote‑exploitation issues are visible in source, but there are notable supply‑chain and operational risks (dependency vulnerabilities, lifecycle scripts, dynamic plugin execution, test install of tarballs, committed build outputs). Addressing dependency audits, lockfile integrity, isolation of lifecycle/script execution, and a few code hygiene items (global test side-effects, explicit engine constraints) will significantly improve security posture.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (30% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, publishable state: there are unstaged/modified tracked files (.voder/* metadata files) that are not committed — this alone caps completeness to the low range.
- Branch is currently synchronized with origin/main (no unpushed local commits), so there are no outstanding pushes; however, that does not offset the uncommitted changes.
- File-tracking problems exist: compiled outputs appear in the repo (dist/ files are present despite dist/ being listed in .gitignore). Committed build artifacts violate the intended ignore rules and weaken version-control correctness.
- No important untracked files were reported, but the presence of committed build outputs and uncommitted metadata means the repo is not properly managed.
- Summary: Uncommitted changes + improperly tracked build outputs → version control is incomplete and risky. Address: commit or discard the modified .voder files and remove committed build outputs from the index (git rm --cached ...) so .gitignore can take effect, then push; only then will the repo approach a clean, >80% state.
