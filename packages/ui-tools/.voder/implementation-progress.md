Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 8.1

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (28% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- Summary of what's complete and what's missing:
  - Complete / present
    - Strong documentation and governance artifacts: detailed ADRs, implementation guides, and a universal development guide. (DOCUMENTATION: 60%)
    - Reasonable package metadata skeleton (package.json) and proper .gitignore / .voderignore rules. (DEPENDENCIES metadata present: 40%)
    - Security thinking and ADRs exist (SECURITY: 70%).
  - Missing / incomplete (critical)
    - No source implementation: the src/ tree and all described APIs (Vite/PostCSS factories, testing helpers, linting config factories, utilities) are absent → core functionality missing. (FUNCTIONALITY: 10%)
    - No automated tests, test runner config or coverage — tests are 0% and cannot be run. (TESTING: 0%)
    - Build/test/verify scripts and devDependencies needed to author, build and validate the package are absent or placeholders → execution is effectively not implemented. (EXECUTION: 2%, CODE_QUALITY: 20%)
    - Version control: many important files are untracked and not committed; repository is not in a clean, publishable state. (VERSION_CONTROL: 20%)
  - Consequence: The repo is currently a documentation/configuration scaffold; it does not contain runnable code, tests, build output or the scripted workflows required by the Universal Guide and package policies. Automated validation (vitest runs, build, lint, verify) cannot be executed until a minimal implementation, tests, and devDependency setup are added and committed.

- Reference to assessment areas and scores:
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 10% — API implementations described in docs are missing.
  - CODE_QUALITY: 20% — no source to check; no lint/format configs, scripts, or tsconfig present.
  - TESTING: 0% — no tests, no test scripts, no coverage.
  - EXECUTION: 2% — build script is a placeholder; nothing has been run or validated.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 60% — strong internal docs and ADRs, missing consumer-facing README and API docs.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 40% — only peerDependencies declared; no dev toolchain installed; cannot audit installed deps.
  - SECURITY: 70% — good policies and .gitignore, but supply-chain & lifecycle-script risks noted.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 20% — many key files are untracked; repo not committed/publishable.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Highest priority: create a small, safe vertical slice that makes the package runnable and testable, commit it to version control, and run tests locally. This addresses the lowest-scoring areas (TESTING, EXECUTION, FUNCTIONALITY, VERSION_CONTROL) in a minimal incremental step.

Concrete next-step plan (smallest useful increment — do these in order):

1. Commit current documentation and metadata
   - Add the current files to git and create an initial commit so the repository is tracked and reproducible.
   - Rationale: Version control must be clean before further work; this resolves VERSION_CONTROL (20%) blockage and preserves ADRs/history.
   - Suggested action: git add . && git commit -m "chore(ui-tools): initial docs and package scaffold"

2. Implement a minimal vertical slice (one tiny, fully-tested feature)
   - Create a minimal src/ + test that proves the pipeline works. Example vertical slice:
     - src/build/postcss.ts — implement createPostCSSConfig (very small, deterministic).
     - src/index.ts — export createPostCSSConfig.
     - tests/build/postcss.test.ts — a vitest test that imports createPostCSSConfig and asserts autoprefixer plugin is present / config structure correct.
     - tsconfig.json — minimal config enabling ts project and include src and tests.
     - Update package.json scripts:
       - "type-check": "tsc --noEmit"
       - "test": "vitest run"
       - "test:watch": "vitest"
       - "build": "tsc -p tsconfig.json" (or leave minimal)
       - "prepare" and "voder" keep as-is for now, but ensure prepare won't execute unsafe code (see security note).
   - Rationale: This gives a working test run (TESTING 0%→some value), demonstrates build/execution works (EXECUTION increases), and establishes a pattern to incrementally implement remaining features.

3. Add the necessary devDependencies (local dev environment)
   - At minimum: typescript, vitest, @types/node, autoprefixer, postcss, @testing-library/dom (if tests will use DOM later). Initially keep dependency list minimal to run the vertical slice.
   - Rationale: tests and type-check require devDependencies. (DEPENDENCIES assessment improves as you install and run npm audit.)

4. Run local validation and capture console-first output
   - Run: npm ci (or npm install), npm run type-check, npm test.
   - Capture results to console (this history becomes .voder/history.md) and fix any issues.
   - Rationale: Execution validation is required by the Universal Guide and will move EXECUTION/TESTING/CODE_QUALITY forward.

5. Iterate: expand implementation and tests
   - Once the vertical slice passes, implement additional factories and helpers one at a time (createViteLibraryConfig, createVitestJsdomConfig, helpers, accessibility). For each addition:
     - Implement source file
     - Add a corresponding unit test
     - Run type-check and tests
     - Commit changes
   - Rationale: Small, tested increments ensure the repository remains working and maintainable.

Security/Version-control guardrails to do now
- Before running npm install / prepare, verify or disable any external prepare script that executes code outside the package root (prepare -> node ../../setup-package-docs.js). If that file is not trusted or not available in CI/dev environment, either make it a no-op or only run it manually.
- Commit a lockfile (package-lock.json) after installing devDependencies for reproducible installs and to enable npm audit.
- Run npm audit and address high/critical advisories early.

If you want, I can:
- Generate the exact minimal files and package.json script modifications for the vertical slice (src/build/postcss.ts, src/index.ts, tests/build/postcss.test.ts, tsconfig.json, package.json scripts) as the next incremental change — small, testable, and commit-ready.
- Or provide the precise git commands and a safe prepare-script checklist you should run before performing installs.

Reasoning: The repo is heavy on documentation but light on runnable code. The single highest-impact action is to make a tiny, tested piece of the implementation work end-to-end and commit it. That will immediately enable automated verification (tests + type-check) and unblock iterative delivery of the rest of the API surface.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (10% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- What exists:
  - package metadata (package.json) with name, version, type, license and a minimal "build" script.
  - PeerDependencies section lists expected runtime peers (vite, vitest, jsdom, jest-axe, autoprefixer, postcss).
  - A devDependency stub pointing to a local @voder/dev-config (file:../dev-config).
  - Documentation and ADRs are present (docs/decisions/* and usage docs) and the implementation guides (prompts/*.md) describing the package design and required behavior.
  - .gitignore and .voderignore are in place with proper rules and negations as required by the universal guide.

- What is missing (critical for functionality):
  - No source implementation: the entire src/ tree (build/, testing/, linting/, utils/, index.ts, etc.) is absent. The package has no functional APIs to export.
  - No TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json) or build configuration files exist.
  - No templates (templates/) and no example vite/vitest config files implemented.
  - No test suite: tests/ directory and all required Vitest tests (unit, integration, package-structure, export-equivalence, smoke tests) are missing.
  - No actual implementations of createViteLibraryConfig, createPostCSSConfig, createVitestJsdomConfig, DOM helpers, accessibility utilities, linting config factories, or setup functions described in the guides.
  - package.json scripts do not implement the mandatory standardized scripts (clean, build, verify, lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, type-check, test, test:ci, lint:md, lint:md:fix, prepare, voder, etc.) required by the Universal Guide and package policies.
  - No devDependencies for tooling required to implement and validate the package (typescript, vitest, eslint, prettier, markdownlint-cli2, @types/node, jest-axe, testing-library, autoprefixer, postcss, etc.) are installed or declared beyond the single local dev-config reference.
  - No dist/ compiled output (expected to be gitignored but LLM-visible via .voderignore) — therefore package export verification tests would fail if run.
  - No ADRs for any new dependencies beyond the inherited ones; no decision to add vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 has effect here.
  - No README, CHANGELOG, or packaged documentation generated from the template (README requirement is implied by guides).

- Consequences with respect to requested functionality:
  - The repository currently contains design documentation and policy artifacts but lacks any executable code implementing the @voder/ui-tools API surface described in the guides.
  - None of the programmatic features (Vite config factory, PostCSS config factory, vitest jsdom config, testing helpers, accessibility utilities, linting config factories) are implemented or testable.
  - Automated validation (Vitest test suites, build, lint, format, verify pipeline) cannot run successfully because scripts, source, and tooling declarations are absent.

- Quick summary judgment:
  - The project is at the documentation and scaffolding stage only. Substantial implementation work remains — create the src/ files, tests, tsconfig, scripts, and devDependencies — before the package provides any of the requested functionality.
  - Estimated functional completeness: ~10% (documentation and config placeholders exist), with ±10% uncertainty.

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (20% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository currently contains only documentation, configuration hints, and a minimal package.json; there is no actual implementation code (no src/ files, no TypeScript sources, no tests), so functional correctness cannot be verified. As a result the codebase is effectively incomplete: required APIs, exports, build/test scripts, and type definitions described in the guides are missing. The package.json is minimal (prepare/voder/build placeholders) and lacks the standardized scripts (clean, build, test, lint, format, verify, etc.) mandated by the project guidelines. There are also no linting/formatting configs (ESLint/Prettier) or tsconfig files present to enforce coding standards. The only actionable metadata is sensible (.gitignore and .voderignore are present and appropriate), but devDependencies point to a local file: "../dev-config" which may be invalid in many environments. In short: there are no implemented sources to assess for bugs; the current state is a documentation/configuration skeleton requiring substantial implementation and automation before code quality (correctness, style, tests, coverage) can be meaningfully evaluated.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (0% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- No automated tests are present or runnable: there is no tests/ directory or test files in the repository, package.json contains no test/test:ci scripts, and Vitest (or any test runner) is not declared as a devDependency. Therefore there are no test results to inspect and test coverage is effectively 0%.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (2% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The codebase has not been run or validated. There are no installed dependencies, no built artifacts, and no test runs recorded. package.json contains only placeholder scripts (e.g., "build": "echo 'Build placeholder'") so the build pipeline is not implemented or tested. Git shows all project files as untracked, and no verification (npm install, npm run build, npm test, etc.) has been executed. In short: execution/validation has not been performed and build scripts do not yet work.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (60% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains strong internal documentation for design and decisions (a complete set of ADRs in docs/decisions/, an extensive universal development guide, and a detailed implementation guide for @voder/ui-tools in prompts/development-ui-tools.md). There are also useful usage notes for @voder/dev-config in docs/libraries/usage/voder-dev-config.md and many concrete examples and test requirements embedded in the guides. However, consumer‑facing documentation is incomplete: there is no package README.md at the package root (required to be public-facing and self-contained), no dedicated API reference or generated docs for the exported functions/types, no CHANGELOG, and no top-level examples that are clearly published for consumers. The implementation guidance lives in prompts/ (internal), not in a published README or docs/api area that consumers will see. To reach “complete” status, add a clear README.md per the README-template (installation, quick start, API snippets), an API reference (or at least documented examples for each public export), package-specific CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY/CHANGELOG sections, and ensure markdown linting/README generation scripts are wired so docs are kept current.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (40% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- High-level summary: The package.json only declares peerDependencies (vite, vitest, jsdom, jest-axe, autoprefixer, postcss) and a local devDependency pointing at "../dev-config". Because these are peerDependencies, they are not installed in this package and therefore this assessment is limited: I cannot inspect installed versions or transitive dependency trees, nor run an npm audit here. Based on the declared ranges, there are no obvious red flags (no deprecated packages listed), but the assessment is incomplete without running registry checks and vulnerability scans.
- Key observations and compatibility notes:
  - vite: ^6.0.0
    - This is a forward-looking major range. If consumers use older Vite majors (v4/v5), there could be incompatibilities. Confirm the intended Vite major and update consumers/README accordingly.
  - vitest: ^3.2.0
    - Matches the ADRs that require Vitest v3.x and V8 coverage provider alignment. Good to keep aligned with @vitest/coverage-v8 in dev environments.
  - jsdom: ^26.0.0
    - Recent major; jsdom has historically had occasional security issues fixed in patch releases. Keep it up-to-date and run audits.
  - jest-axe: ^9.0.0
    - Typical choice for accessibility testing in JS test environments. Check for peer compatibility with jsdom and testing libraries.
  - autoprefixer: ^10.0.0 and postcss: ^8.0.0
    - Stable major versions used widely. Newer major releases may exist; verify if consumers need newer PostCSS/AP versions. Autoprefixer v10 is generally safe but check for known advisories.
  - devDependencies: "@voder/dev-config": "file:../dev-config"
    - A local file dependency; no registry vulnerabilities but it means tooling for lint/tests likely comes from that local package. Confirm that dev-config's own devDependencies/peerDependencies are up-to-date and audited.
- Security & freshness risks (what to verify next):
  - No automated vulnerability data is available here — you must run:
    - npm audit (or npm audit --registry <mirror>) and review advisories
    - npm outdated to see if newer minors/patches exist for these peer ranges
    - A supply-chain scan (Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check, or GitHub Dependabot) for transitive issues
  - Because these are peerDependencies, consumers will install them; ensure your README and docs clearly list required peer dependency versions so consumers install compatible, secure versions.
  - Verify Vitest <-> @vitest/coverage-v8 exact alignment in any dev/test envs to avoid runtime "Cannot find module" or peer conflicts (per ADR).
- Recommendations
  - Run (locally) npm audit and npm outdated and capture results to console; address high/severe advisories immediately.
  - If you maintain a CI gate, run npm ci && npm audit and fail builds on high/critical vulnerabilities.
  - Consider adding automated dependency monitoring (Dependabot/Snyk) for transitive vulnerability detection.
  - If you intend to rely on specific coverage tooling (V8 provider), include that in devDependencies of the package that runs tests (not as a peerDependency) and keep versions aligned.
  - When bumping major versions (e.g., Vite v6), create an ADR and tests to verify compatibility with consumer projects.
- Conclusion: Based solely on the package.json declarations, there are no explicit warnings, but this is an incomplete assessment (≈40%). I cannot guarantee there are no significant vulnerabilities or that the declared ranges map to the latest secure releases without running registry-based checks (npm audit / npm outdated) and inspecting transitive dependency trees. Run those commands and share the output for a near-complete assessment.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (70% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall: the repository currently contains mostly documentation and design/code examples rather than a full runtime implementation. No secrets are present in committed files shown; .gitignore correctly excludes common sensitive/output files (.env, logs, dist, node_modules). However there are notable supply‑chain and execution-surface risks to address before this package is used widely.

Key findings and recommendations

1. Supply‑chain / dependency locking
   - Issue: package.json currently expresses only peerDependencies and a file: dev-dep; there is a package-lock.json in the working tree but it is untracked. Without a committed lockfile, installs are non‑deterministic and susceptible to dependency supply‑chain changes and newly introduced vulnerabilities.
   - Risk: medium → attackers / compromise in transitive dependencies; unpredictable versions across environments.
   - Recommendation: commit a lockfile (package-lock.json / pnpm-lock.yaml / yarn.lock) or otherwise ensure reproducible installs and integrate regular npm audit and SCA scans. The project ADRs require supply‑chain audits—implement those in CI and local verify scripts.

2. Arbitrary code execution via npm lifecycle scripts
   - Issue: package.json includes a "prepare" script: "node ../../setup-package-docs.js". npm runs prepare on install in many circumstances. That script runs arbitrary JS from a relative path external to the package.
   - Risk: high (if code at that path is untrusted or mutable) → arbitrary code execution during install.
   - Recommendation: ensure the referenced setup script is auditable, minimal, and stored in a trusted repository location. Limit what prepare does (prefer read-only doc generation without network or shell commands). Document and review lifecycle scripts in ADRs. Consider gating prepare actions or using a safer, non-lifecycle command for documentation setup.

3. Execution of shell commands from tests / child_process
   - Issue: tests and integration examples use child_process.execSync (e.g., npm pack, npm install, node test files). execSync invoked with dynamic strings can be an injection vector if inputs are influenced by untrusted data.
   - Risk: medium → tests running in CI or on developer machines can execute arbitrary commands if inputs are manipulated.
   - Recommendation: ensure all execSync invocations use fixed commands or properly sanitized/validated inputs. Avoid constructing command strings from untrusted sources. Prefer passing args as arrays via spawnSync when possible. Restrict test execution contexts and run tests in isolated environments.

4. Node engine requirement and TypeScript config execution
   - Issue: some implementation patterns (prettier.config.ts imported natively with experimental flag) require Node >=22.6. package.json currently does not have an "engines" field enforcing Node version.
   - Risk: low-medium → running with older Node may fail or require insecure workarounds.
   - Recommendation: add "engines": { "node": ">=22.6.0" } to package.json and document the requirement. CI should validate Node version.

5. Peer dependency version alignment (Vitest + coverage provider)
   - Issue: ADRs note exact version alignment required for vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8. If developers or CI install non‑aligned versions, tests can fail or load incompatible code.
   - Risk: medium → test-time failures, potential to pull in incompatible or vulnerable versions.
   - Recommendation: enforce alignment via lockfile and add automated tests that validate version compatibility. Consider adding a test that reads package.json / installed package versions to assert alignment.

6. Use of execSync / node to run temporary files in integration tests
   - Issue: tests write test.mjs/test files and then run node on them. If a test consumer environment is compromised, these patterns can be abused to execute injected code.
   - Risk: low-medium for a controlled dev environment, but higher if CI runners are multi-tenant.
   - Recommendation: run tests on isolated/ephemeral CI agents, sanitize inputs to temporary test files, and ensure cleanup. Prefer programmatic imports via Node's module loader with controlled sandboxing where feasible.

7. Absence of explicit SCA / audit automation
   - Issue: ADRs prescribe supply‑chain audits but the repository does not show automated audit hooks.
   - Risk: medium.
   - Recommendation: integrate npm audit, Snyk/OSS‑SCA, or equivalent into the verify pipeline and fail fast on high/severe vulnerabilities. Automate periodic scans.

8. Files and scripts referencing relative repository paths
   - Issue: scripts like "voder": "node ../../../voder/apps/voder-cli/index.js" and prepare referencing files outside package root mean install-time behavior depends on monorepo layout. If a consumer or CI installs only this package without repository context, those scripts may break or execute unintended code.
   - Risk: low-medium.
   - Recommendation: ensure scripts behave safely when referenced files are missing (fail gracefully) and document expectations. Avoid relying on files outside the package for install-time scripts unless strictly controlled.

9. Safe DOM handling and XSS considerations
   - Observation: helper utilities use textContent and do not set innerHTML; patterns shown avoid XSS. This is good. Continue to avoid innerHTML and untrusted HTML insertion in utilities.

10. Temporary artifacts and repo cleanliness
    - Observation: .gitignore excludes outputs and temporary files. Tests that create files respect using OS temp directories in examples; ensure tests do not write into repository workspace so secrets or logs are not accidentally committed.

Summary / Priority remediation
- High priority: lockfile commitment & SCA; audit lifecycle scripts (prepare) for arbitrary execution; enforce Node engine.
- Medium priority: sanitize and harden execSync usages in tests; add automated version alignment checks for vitest provider; add SCA automation to verify pipeline.
- Low priority: improve documentation around scripts referencing external repo paths and ensure safe behavior when external files are absent.

If you want, I can:
- propose concrete package.json changes (engines, scripts) and a safe prepare wrapper, or
- create a small Vitest test that asserts vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 version alignment, and/or
- add a short security ADR template capturing these mitigations for traceability.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (20% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, publishable VCS state. There are many important project files present in the working tree that are currently untracked (package.json, package-lock.json, docs/decisions/*, prompts/*, .gitignore, .voderignore, etc.). Because those changes are not committed, the project fails the “all changes committed” requirement.
- Branch synchronization appears fine: Git reports the branch is up to date with origin/main (no unpushed local commits). Therefore there are no unpushed commits affecting completeness.
- File tracking is inadequate: Git currently tracks 0 files for this project and 15/15 project files are untracked. Although .gitignore looks correct for build outputs, critical source & metadata files are not yet added to the repository, so the repository cannot be considered properly managed.
- Clean working state is not satisfied: untracked important files prevent the repo from being in a reproducible, publishable state.

Summary of concrete issues:
- Uncommitted/untracked important files → major problem (prevents reproducible history and sharing).
- No unpushed commits (good).
- Proper ignore rules appear present for build outputs, but the core sources/metadata are not tracked.

Overall completeness: low (around 20%) because of uncommitted/untracked files, even though branch sync is OK.
