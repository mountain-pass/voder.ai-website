![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (50% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What is complete
  - Foundational pieces and governance are in place: ADRs, decision docs, and development policy artifacts are comprehensive and committed.
  - A concrete implementation exists for the PostCSS factory and it is exported from src/index.ts — this provides the single working public API currently implemented.
  - TypeScript toolchain is configured (strict mode, declaration output) and type-checking runs successfully.
  - Many required devDependencies / peerDependencies are declared and intentionally aligned per ADRs (notably vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8).
  - Some tests (smoke and package-structure scaffolds) exist and isolated vitest runs have passed previously.

- What is missing or failing (summary of gaps)
  - Major functional surface is missing: Vite library config factory, Vitest jsdom factory, DOM testing helpers, accessibility utilities, linting configuration factories, templates, and the dual-export packaging layout are largely unimplemented or not exported. (FUNCTIONALITY: 30%)
  - Tests are insufficient and/or brittle: only minimal smoke and package-structure tests exist, coverage is far below the required thresholds, integration/export-equivalence/package-installation tests are absent, and the pipeline is blocked by build/test coupling. (TESTING: 15%)
  - Build pipeline instability: the full verification pipeline fails during build due to a TS5055 overwrite error (tsc trying to overwrite files under dist/), so the end-to-end build/test verification is not passing. (EXECUTION: 60%)
  - Version control state is not clean: there are modified .voder/* files not committed (git working tree not clean), which blocks a clean publishable state. (VERSION_CONTROL: 25%)
  - Documentation: strong ADRs and internal guidance exist but consumer-facing README, CHANGELOG, API docs, and required markdown-lint config generation are missing. (DOCUMENTATION: 38%)
  - Code quality is reasonably good for the implemented bits — TypeScript strictness and ESM patterns are followed. Some test design brittleness and missing lint configuration reduce overall code-quality confidence. (CODE_QUALITY: 65%)
  - Dependencies and security posture are generally strong — versions are recent and prior npm audit reported zero issues; supply-chain controls and lifecycle-script vigilance are recommended. (DEPENDENCIES: 85%, SECURITY: 85%)

- Reference to sub-assessment findings
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 30% — only PostCSS factory and public export barrel implemented; most requested APIs missing.
  - CODE_QUALITY: 65% — small/clean code, TypeScript strictness; brittle test coupling and missing lint configs.
  - TESTING: 15% — minimal tests; missing unit/integration categories and coverage far below policy.
  - EXECUTION: 60% — tsc type-check passes, but full build step fails (TS5055), blocking end-to-end verification.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 38% — ADRs strong; consumer README/API/CHANGELOG and markdown-lint generation missing.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 85% — modern versions, vitest/provider aligned; run periodic audits to confirm.
  - SECURITY: 85% — no code-level red flags; supply-chain and install-time script hygiene required.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 25% — modified .voder files present (uncommitted) — working tree not clean.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Based on the lowest-scoring areas (TESTING and VERSION_CONTROL) and the pipeline blockage (build TS5055), the highest-priority next steps are:

1) Make the repository state clean (Version Control)
   - Commit or stash the modified .voder files so the working tree is clean. A clean working state is required before further verification or releases and reduces noise when diagnosing build issues.
   - Rationale: VERSION_CONTROL is blocking progress and must be resolved first (current score 25%).

2) Unblock the verification pipeline by stabilizing the build (Execution / Functionality)
   - Investigate and resolve the TS5055 tsc overwrite errors: verify tsconfig include/exclude, ensure no compiled outputs are tracked, remove stale dist/ artifacts, and confirm tsc's outDir is not being used as input by the compiler. After cleaning, run:
     - npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test
   - Rationale: Build must pass to run package-structure/export tests and to enable test expansion (EXECUTION 60%, FUNCTIONALITY 30%).

3) While resolving the build, temporarily make tests resilient to missing dist/ to allow tests to run locally (Testing)
   - As a targeted, temporary measure: guard package-structure.test.ts so it skips assertions when dist/ is absent (or ensure pretest runs build). This should be a single, small change to unblock CI/test iteration — but only as a stopgap while fixing the root cause.
   - Rationale: TESTING scored lowest (15%); unblocking the suite allows fast feedback loops.

4) After build is stable, incrementally implement and test missing functional modules (Functionality & Testing)
   - Implement one module + test at a time in this order: createViteLibraryConfig → unit test; createVitestJsdomConfig → unit test; testing helpers & accessibility utilities → unit tests; linting config factories → unit tests.
   - Add integration tests required by the guide (export-equivalence, package-installation via npm pack) after the dist/ layout and exports are stable.
   - Rationale: progress incrementally and keep verification green after each small commit.

Quick actionable checklist for the immediate next iteration:
- git add .voder/* && git commit -m "chore: update .voder metadata" (or git stash) — clean working tree
- Run the verification pipeline and capture output
- If build still fails with TS5055, inspect tsc error paths and tsconfig includes/excludes and remove any stray tracked compiled files
- Temporarily guard package-structure.test.ts only if necessary to allow test runs while fixing build

Once the repository is clean and the build/test pipeline is green, continue the incremental implementation and test plan above.

---  
Final note: status is INCOMPLETE. Priority is to clean VC and fix the build so tests can run reliably — these two fixes will unblock the largest number of downstream requirements (testing, functionality, documentation verification).



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (30% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Implemented features (what works / in place)
  - Core PostCSS factory implemented and exported: src/build/postcss.ts (createPostCSSConfig) is present and wired through src/index.ts so the package exposes the primary PostCSS API requested by the guide.
  - Minimal public API: src/index.ts exports the PostCSS factory as the package's public surface.
  - TypeScript toolchain configured: tsconfig.json with declaration generation and outDir is present; type-checking runs (previous runs succeeded).
  - Safe vite.config.ts exists to avoid optional-plugin startup failures.
  - Initial Vitest tests exist (tests/smoke.test.ts, tests/package-structure.test.ts) and the test harness is wired (package.json scripts for test/test:ci/type-check/build exist).
  - ADRs and decision docs for UI tools and inherited policies are committed under docs/decisions — documentation/governance artifacts are mostly present.
  - Many devDependencies and peerDependencies required by the guide are listed in package.json (vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, postcss, autoprefixer, jsdom, jest-axe, testing-library, markdownlint-cli2, typescript, etc.).

- Missing / incomplete features (what is not implemented or not meeting requirements)
  - Large portion of package functionality described in prompts/development-ui-tools.md is absent:
    - Vite library config factory (createViteLibraryConfig) — either not implemented or not exported.
    - Vitest jsdom configuration factory (createVitestJsdomConfig) and testing helpers (renderComponent, simulateClick, waitForNextFrame, etc.) are not present/exported.
    - Accessibility utilities (expectAccessible, getAccessibilityViolations, accessibilityTests) are not implemented/exported.
    - Linting configuration factories (createHTMLLintConfig, createCSSLintConfig, createAccessibilityLintConfig) are not implemented/exported.
    - Templates/ examples under templates/ are not present.
  - Package dual-export strategy and dist layout required by the universal guide are not fulfilled:
    - package.json exports point to ./dist/src/index.js, but dist/ is not produced and tests assert dist files should exist; build/test coupling currently broken (TS5055 build error previously observed).
    - Many required scripts mandated by the universal guide (lint, lint:fix, format, lint:md, lint:md:fix, verify) are missing from package.json; mandatory prepare/voder/lint:md scripts required by the guide are partially present (prepare, voder exist) but other required scripts are not added.
  - Tests & coverage requirements are far from met:
    - The mandatory test categories (export-equivalence, package-installation integration, package-structure, smoke, export-equivalence) are not all implemented. Only smoke and package-structure tests exist; many unit/integration tests for the factories and utilities are missing.
    - Coverage thresholds and the required >90% coverage goals are not met (not enough tests).
  - Packaging/build issues remain unresolved:
    - The earlier TS5055 error indicates build/output layout or tsconfig/include/exclude problems; the build process is not yet stable/green.
    - package-structure.test currently assumes compiled dist/ artifacts exist and will fail until build issues are resolved or tests are guarded.
  - Mandatory markdown linting integration and configuration generation from @voder/dev-config are not implemented (no .markdownlint.json generation, no lint:md scripts that match the guide).
  - README, CHANGELOG, and public-facing docs required by the README isolation policy are missing.
  - Many code-quality configuration files referenced by the universal guide (eslint.config.js importing @voder/dev-config layers, prettier.config.ts exporting dev-config prettier, etc.) are not present.

- Assessment vs. original requirements
  - The package has a correct starting point for the PostCSS requirement and the repository contains governance artifacts and many declared dependencies — a solid foundation.
  - However, the core scope of @voder/ui-tools (Vite library factory, jsdom testing config, DOM testing helpers, accessibility utilities, HTML/CSS/accessibility linting factories, templates, dual exports, and the standardized scripts/test coverage) is largely unimplemented.
  - The build/test verification pipeline is currently unreliable due to build artifact / TS build issues; until build is stable and required tests pass, the package does not meet the universal verification and distribution requirements.

- Overall completeness estimate
  - Approximately 30% complete: foundational infra and one concrete feature (PostCSS factory) plus decision docs and many dependencies are in place, but the majority of functional APIs, tests, packaging/export configuration, scripts, and verification stability are still missing or failing.

Recommendations (brief)
  - Stabilize the build (fix tsconfig include/exclude and eliminate the TS5055 overwrite errors) so dist/ can be produced cleanly.
  - Implement and test one additional module at a time (createViteLibraryConfig → tests), following the incremental plan.
  - Add the mandatory scripts (lint, format, lint:md, verify) and the missing tests to meet the universal policy.

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (65% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Overall status: The implementation is minimal and mostly correct for the pieces present (PostCSS factory exported from src, tests reference source modules). TypeScript config is strict, and the ESM import patterns (explicit `.js` extensions in exports) follow the project's NodeNext/ESM guidance. Basic typing and test patterns are used appropriately.

- Correctness / Bugs:
  - Source code itself (the exported createPostCSSConfig entry in src/index.ts and the PostCSS factory implemented per the project history) appears well structured and likely to work when compiled. The TypeScript compiler (tsc --noEmit) has run successfully in prior verification runs.
  - However, there is a known fragility in the test suite: tests/package-structure.test.ts asserts that package.json exports point to existing files in dist/. That test couples test execution to a prior build step (dist/ must exist). This makes the test suite brittle unless build is always run before tests. This is a test-design issue rather than a runtime bug in the library code, but it affects the verification pipeline and developer experience.
  - The repository previously experienced TS5055 build errors (tsc trying to overwrite files under dist/). That indicates a build / git state problem (stale or tracked compiled files or include/exclude misconfiguration) rather than a logic bug in source code. Until that root cause is resolved, builds can fail even if source code is correct.
  - The smoke test was patched to import from src instead of dist to avoid a type-resolution failure during type-check; that change is OK for verifying runtime of the source but highlights the existing test/build coupling mentioned above.

- Coding standards / maintainability:
  - TypeScript strict mode is enabled and declaration output is configured; good practice.
  - The source uses explicit .js import extensions in ESM imports as required for the target output; this matches the project's ESM/NodeNext approach.
  - There is no committed ESLint / Prettier config in the package (the repository relies on shared @voder/dev-config), so local linting rules are not visible in the package. The code is simple enough that style issues are minimal, but there is no enforcement present in the repo to ensure consistency.
  - Small style nit: src/index.ts begins with a leading space before the comment and export line (cosmetic only).
  - Tests are written with Vitest and follow the project's patterns, but as noted, some tests assume build artifacts exist; test design should be hardened to avoid depending on non-committed build outputs (or the build should be run as part of verify).

- Missing / incomplete items that affect quality:
  - The package export mapping points to dist/ files (correct pattern) but the tests and build must be kept in sync. The repository should either:
    - ensure build runs before tests (pretest script), or
    - make package-structure test resilient when dist/ is missing (temporary guard), or
    - adjust test to operate against source artifacts in a repeatable way.
  - There are no ESLint / Prettier config files committed for local enforcement (the project expects centralized dev-config). Without local configs, contributors may not get consistent linting locally.
  - No explicit unit tests for createPostCSSConfig shown in the current file set (history indicates the test exists/planned), so public API surface coverage is limited at the moment.

- Recommendations (concise):
  1. Make package-structure.test.ts resilient (skip or adapt assertions when dist/ is missing), or run build before tests in scripts to remove brittleness.
  2. Investigate and fix the root cause of the TS5055 build errors (stale tracked dist files or tsconfig include/exclude issues) so the build step completes reliably.
  3. Add or enable ESLint/Prettier configs (via @voder/dev-config) locally to enforce code style and catch issues early.
  4. Add focused unit tests for createPostCSSConfig and other exported helpers to improve API coverage.

- Conclusion: The implemented code is small and generally correct, but the verification workflow is brittle due to build/test coupling and a historical TS build error. Addressing the test resilience and the TS5055 root cause will move the codebase from "mostly correct" to robust and verifiable.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (15% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Current test surface is minimal and incomplete. The repository contains two active Vitest suites: tests/smoke.test.ts and tests/package-structure.test.ts. These exercise only:
  - a smoke import of the source barrel (smoke test), and
  - package.json export structure assertions that require compiled dist/ artifacts.
- Test results: Earlier runs reported 2 tests passing, but the full verification pipeline currently fails because the build step errors (TS5055). That build failure causes the package-structure test (which expects dist/) to block the verification run. The smoke test was recently adjusted to import source to avoid a dist dependency and should pass in isolation, but the overall pipeline is not green.
- Coverage: No coverage reports or thresholds are present/verified in the repo output. The existing tests do not approach the project's stated coverage goals (required 90% overall and 100% public API coverage). Current automated coverage is effectively 0% for most code paths and public APIs.
- Missing test categories (per project requirements):
  - Unit tests for build/postcss factory, Vite config factory, testing helpers, accessibility utils, linting config generators, and utilities are missing or not present.
  - Integration tests required by the guide (export-equivalence, package-exports, package-installation via npm pack) are absent.
  - Dependency/version-alignment tests (e.g., vitest ↔ @vitest/coverage-v8) are not implemented.
- Robustness: One test (package-structure.test.ts) couples tests to build artifacts and currently prevents running verification when dist/ is absent or build is broken. That coupling must be addressed (either by guarding the test when dist/ is missing or by fixing the underlying build issue).
- Summary judgment: Testing is in an early scaffold state — some smoke checks exist, but the test suite is far from adequate or comprehensive. Coverage and required integration tests are largely missing, and the pipeline is currently blocked by a build-related failure that prevents reliable verification runs.

Recommendation (short): Either make package-structure assertions resilient when dist/ is missing (temporary) so tests can run while you fix the TS5055 build issue, or fix the root TS build problem first and then expand unit/integration tests to reach the coverage and categories required by the Universal Testing Standards.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (60% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The project is partially validated but not fully. Type checking (tsc --noEmit) succeeds and individual Vitest runs have passed previously, showing the TypeScript sources and unit tests are largely in good shape. However the full verification pipeline (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) is failing: the TypeScript build step fails with TS5055 (tsc attempting to overwrite files under dist/), and that stopped the end-to-end build/test validation. The last recorded verification run failed during build; smoke/package-structure tests had to be adjusted to avoid coupling to missing/blocked dist/ outputs. In short: the pieces (type-check, tests) mostly work in isolation, but the build scripts do not complete end-to-end due to the TS5055 build conflict, so the software has not been successfully run and validated end-to-end.

<scratchpad>
Observations from repo:
- Present docs:
  - docs/decisions/* (multiple ADRs, both local and inherited) — good coverage.
  - docs/libraries/usage/postcss.md and voder-dev-config.md — helpful high‑level library usage notes.
  - prompts/* files contain extensive implementation guides and examples (these are internal but useful).
- Missing or incomplete:
  - No README.md at package root describing @voder/ui-tools for consumers (the universal guide mandates README using a template).
  - No CHANGELOG.md present.
  - No generated .markdownlint.json as required by the markdown-lint ADR / universal guide.
  - No packaged API reference / docs describing the exported functions/types (src/index.ts only exports createPostCSSConfig).
  - templates/ directory and single-file usage templates referenced in guides may be missing from repo.
  - No dedicated docs/usage or API reference for the package's actual public surface (examples exist only in prompts but not in public README/docs).
  - Package scripts required by documentation (lint:md, lint:md:fix, format scripts etc.) are not present in package.json (affects documentation expectations but falls into docs completeness).
- Quality of existing docs:
  - ADRs are thorough and well-formed; decision history is strong.
  - Library usage docs are good for PostCSS and dev-config, but they are not a package README or API reference.
- Result: Strong design & policy docs, but consumer-facing documentation and API/reference artifacts are largely missing.

Scoring rationale:
- High marks for ADRs, policy, and internal guidance.
- Low marks for missing README, CHANGELOG, API surface docs, and required markdown config file.
- Recommend prioritized next documentation tasks: add README.md (consumer-facing, self-contained) using the README-template, add a minimal API reference (docs/api.md or expanded README sections) for exported functions (createPostCSSConfig), add CHANGELOG.md stub, add .markdownlint.json generation step or file, and surface usage examples from prompts into README/templates.
</scratchpad>

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (38% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository has strong decision documentation (ADRs) and some useful library-usage pages (PostCSS, dev-config) plus rich internal implementation guides, but it lacks the essential consumer-facing documentation and API surface material: there is no README.md for @voder/ui-tools, no CHANGELOG.md, no published API reference or examples surfaced in the package docs, and the mandated markdown-lint configuration/generation artifact is missing. Prioritize adding a self-contained README (based on the provided README template) with quick-start + API examples, a CHANGELOG stub, a short API reference (or docs/api.md) for exported functions, and the .markdownlint.json (or generation script) to reach a usable, consumer-ready documentation baseline.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall: Dependencies look modern and intentionally version-aligned per the ADRs (notably vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 are aligned at 3.2.x). The repository history shows an npm audit run that reported zero vulnerabilities, which is a strong signal (but is a point-in-time result).
- Freshness: Core tooling is recent:
  - TypeScript (^5.9.2), Vitest (^3.2.4) and @vitest/coverage-v8 (^3.2.4) are on contemporary major/minor lines consistent with the ADRs.
  - jsdom ^26.x, autoprefixer ^10.x and postcss ^8.x are also current major versions for their ecosystems.
- Security: The project previously ran `npm audit` and captured zero reported vulnerabilities. That indicates no known high/critical issues at the time of that scan. However, I cannot independently verify live advisories from this environment—re-run `npm audit` in CI/local to confirm current state.
- Compatibility:
  - Vitest ↔ coverage provider alignment is correct (ADR-mandated).
  - TypeScript and Node/ESM settings appear consistent (tsconfig uses NodeNext; README/ADRs require Node ≥22.6.0 for TS config loading).
  - Some duplicate declarations exist (same packages appear in peerDependencies and devDependencies). That is intentional for config packages but should be audited for consistent ranges.
- Minor issues / mismatches to review:
  - peerDependencies lists jest-axe `^9.0.0` while devDependencies include jest-axe `^10.0.0` — this may produce peer warnings for consumers or inconsistent expected APIs. Consider aligning peer range with tested/dev version or documenting why a newer dev version is used.
  - peerDependencies list `vite: ^6.0.0` but `vite` is not in devDependencies. If @voder/ui-tools needs to run Vite-based tests or build in package CI, consider adding vite as a devDependency (or document why it's intentionally absent).
  - postcss/autoprefixer are both in peerDependencies and devDependencies — acceptable for config packages but keep ranges aligned to avoid consumer conflicts.
- Transitive risk: No offline check of transitive dependencies is possible here. Transitive packages can introduce vulnerabilities; regular `npm audit` and lockfile review are required.
- Recommended actions (minimal, high-value):
  1. Re-run `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` (or use your preferred SCA tool) locally/CI to confirm current vulnerability status.
  2. Run `npm outdated` (or `npm ls` / `npm explain`) to list any outdated dependencies and evaluate upgrades, prioritizing security fixes and major misalignments.
  3. Align peerDependency version ranges with the versions you test against (e.g., bump peer jest-axe to ^10.x or document the deviation).
  4. If you need to run Vite-related builds/tests during dev, add `vite` to devDependencies or explicitly document that consumers must provide it.
  5. Periodically re-run audits and keep the ADRs in sync with dependency changes (per the repository policy).
- Confidence note: Assessment is based on declared versions and repository history (which included a successful npm audit). I cannot query live vulnerability databases from this environment—please run `npm audit` / SCA in CI for an up-to-date, authoritative report.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)

- Summary judgment
  - There are no immediate, glaring code-level vulnerabilities (no use of eval, no unsafe direct DOM innerHTML writes in tracked source, no network calls or credential handling in source files). The code surface is primarily configuration factories, test helpers, and build tooling; those are low-risk by nature.
  - The primary security risks are supply‑chain and developer-tooling execution risks, plus a few operational hygiene items. These are typical for packages that run tooling and scripts during development/install and depend on many dev dependencies.

- Supply‑chain / dependency risks
  - Many devDependencies and peerDependencies are declared (vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, postcss, autoprefixer, markdownlint-cli2, jest-axe, jsdom, etc.). Any of these packages (or their transitive dependencies) can be a supply-chain vector.
  - Mitigation/status: docs/decisions include a supply-chain ADR (inherited-0007) and prior npm audit runs reported zero vulnerabilities. Still: regular automated SCA (software composition analysis), lockfile pinning, and registry-mirroring/verification are recommended and partly required by ADRs.
  - Recommendation: enable automated SCA, pin or review upgrades, ensure package-lock.json is committed and audited, and enforce registry mirror / integrity checks in CI.

- Scripts that execute code on install / developer machines
  - package.json has a "prepare" script: node ../../setup-package-docs.js. Any repository script executed during npm install (prepare, preinstall, postinstall) runs arbitrary JS on contributors' machines and is a high-risk vector if the script is changed or originates from untrusted sources.
  - Recommendation: ensure prepare script is minimal, reviewed, and documented; avoid side effects requiring network or secret access. Consider moving non-essential tasks out of lifecycle scripts or gate them behind explicit make/npm commands.

- Dynamic imports and optional plugin handling
  - vite.config.ts uses dynamic import of an optional plugin (vite-plugin-inline-source). Dynamic import is used defensively (try/catch). If an optional plugin is installed but malicious, it could run code at build/startup time.
  - Recommendation: treat optional plugins as untrusted input—document required plugin sources, prefer pinned versions, and avoid executing untrusted plugins in high-privilege contexts. Run builds/tests in CI with restricted permissions and using mirrored registries.

- Execution in tests / examples
  - The repository’s docs/examples (and some proposed tests in the guide) use child_process.execSync and temporary npm pack/install patterns (in examples). While not present in tracked source tests now, when implemented these can run external processes (npm, node) which increases attack surface.
  - Recommendation: when implementing tests that run execSync/npm pack, run them in isolated temp directories, with limited environment, and ensure CI runner policies limit network and artifact sources. Avoid running tests that install arbitrary remote packages.

- Configuration-as-code risks
  - The project and inherited guidance encourage shipping TypeScript config files (e.g., prettier.config.ts) that are imported/executed by tools. Tooling that loads config files will execute them; a malicious or compromised config file is therefore code execution vector.
  - Recommendation: prefer exporting plain data where possible; if executable configs are required, keep them minimal and audited. Document Node flags and runtime expectations and enforce code review for changes to config files.

- Test environment mocking and globals
  - setup.ts defines global mocks (matchMedia, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver) and extends expect (via jest-dom/jest-axe). These are test-time only and do not run in production; risk is limited to test execution environment. However, tests that run in untrusted CI contexts should avoid writing secrets or performing network I/O.
  - Recommendation: keep test setup isolated; do not access environment variables or external networks from test setup unless explicitly required and controlled.

- File system and repo hygiene
  - The repo explicitly disallows writing logs or outputs into tracked paths and has a comprehensive .gitignore. This reduces the risk of accidental leakage of secrets into repo artifacts.
  - Recommendation: ensure sensitive data (credentials, tokens) are never placed into tracked .voder metadata files. Audit .voder/* files for secrets before pushing.

- Privilege and exposure concerns
  - Package is private and marked UNLICENSED, which limits public exposure, but private packages still need supply-chain care.
  - No web server, network listener, or runtime code that would accept external input at runtime is present. That limits runtime attack surface.

- Missing / recommended hardening steps
  1. Enforce automated dependency scanning (SCA) in CI and local pre-commit hooks; fail builds on high/severe vulnerabilities.
  2. Validate and pin critical dev tooling versions (especially vitest and coverage provider) and include tests that assert version alignment (ADR mandates this).
  3. Review and minimize lifecycle scripts (prepare). Consider making prepare optional or read-only and document exactly what it does; avoid network calls or executing arbitrary code on npm install.
  4. Verify registry integrity (use registry mirror / configured registries) and enable checksum verification where supported.
  5. Audit and review any future code that uses child_process, dynamic imports of third‑party plugins, or that writes files into the repo.
  6. Ensure no sensitive values are present in committed .voder files; add scanning (git hooks or CI) for secrets.
  7. When adding tests that run npm pack and install, sandbox them (tmpdirs, no network unless necessary) and assert they do not execute unexpected scripts.

- Verdict / risk level
  - Code-level risk: low (no obvious insecure coding patterns).
  - Operational / supply-chain risk: moderate — typical for tooling-heavy packages. The project already documents supply-chain and version-alignment policies (good). The most important actionable items are controlling install-time scripts (prepare) and continuing automated dependency audits and lockfile management.

- Final note
  - Given the repository role (development tooling package), the largest security threat is supply-chain compromise via dependencies or install-time scripts. Addressing those (pinning, auditing, registry controls, cautious lifecycle scripts) will materially reduce overall risk.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The repository is NOT in a clean, publishable state: there are unstaged/modified files present (several .voder/* files shown as "Changes not staged for commit"), so not all changes are committed. Because of uncommitted changes the repo cannot be considered properly managed under version control.
- Positives: your branch is up to date with origin/main (no unpushed commits), there are no untracked important files, and build outputs (dist/, coverage/, node_modules/) appear to be correctly ignored by .gitignore/.voderignore. However the outstanding modified .voder files prevent a clean working state and therefore hold the overall completeness to ~25%.

Summary of specifics:
- Uncommitted changes: yes — multiple modified .voder/* files (blocks completeness) → major issue.
- Unpushed commits: none — branch is synchronized with origin/main.
- File tracking / ignores: good — dist and other build artifacts are gitignored; no untracked important files shown.
- Net result: because of uncommitted modifications the repository is far from fully managed under VC (score limited to the low range). 

Recommended immediate action (not applied): commit or stash the .voder changes (or intentionally discard if they are transient) to reach a clean working tree before further verification or publishing.
