Projected completion (from current rate): cycle 32.7

<scratchpad>
- Collate previous sub-assessments (assistant outputs):
  - FUNCTIONALITY 15%
  - CODE_QUALITY 45%
  - TESTING 10%
  - EXECUTION 10%
  - DOCUMENTATION 35%
  - DEPENDENCIES 40%
  - SECURITY 70%
  - VERSION_CONTROL 25%
- These show major gaps in tests, execution/build, public API, scripts, and VC cleanliness.
- Next highest-impact steps: implement minimal vertical slice from the plan (export barrel, tsconfig, small test, package.json scripts, ADR, install devDeps), then run type-check and tests; also commit/clean .voder modified files.
- Version control must be cleaned (commit or restore .voder changes) before pushing further work.
- Note: user-provided sub-summary included Testing: 90% which conflicts with assistant's earlier Testing: 10%; use assistant's earlier numbers in assessment.

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (41% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- Summary of completeness:
  - What is complete
    - Documentation and governance artifacts are strong: multiple ADRs and detailed internal implementation guides exist and have been committed (good coverage of design decisions).
    - One concrete implementation file exists: src/build/postcss.ts (PostCSS + Autoprefixer factory).
    - package.json metadata is present with peerDependencies and minimal scripts (prepare, voder, placeholder build).
  - What is missing or incomplete (critical):
    - Public API/export barrel (src/index.ts) is not present — consumers cannot import package exports (FUNCTIONALITY 15%).
    - Vite/Vitest factories, testing utilities, linting factories, templates, and the rest of the planned source files are not implemented — the bulk of required runtime features are missing.
    - TypeScript project configuration (tsconfig.json), standard package scripts (type-check, test, build), and devDependencies for development/testing are not added — prevents validation and builds (EXECUTION 10%, DEPENDENCIES 40%).
    - Automated tests are not present or runnable (no Vitest, no tests committed) — test coverage is effectively 0% and does not meet the 90% policy (TESTING 10%).
    - package.json lacks exports, build pipeline, and the package-structure/export-equivalence tests required by policy.
    - Version control: working tree contains modified .voder metadata files that are not committed; repository not in a clean state (VERSION_CONTROL 25%).
    - Documentation: strong internal docs but missing a consumer-facing README.md, CHANGELOG, and packaged markdown-lint setup (DOCUMENTATION 35%).
    - Security posture: conceptual policies and ADRs are present and reasonable, but automated audit & supply-chain checks are not yet executed (SECURITY 70%).
  - Reference to assessment numbers:
    - FUNCTIONALITY: 15% — only PostCSS factory implemented; most features missing.
    - CODE_QUALITY: 45% — single file follows good practices but repo lacks linting, type-checking and broader enforcement.
    - TESTING: 10% — no committed tests or test runner configuration; coverage not met.
    - EXECUTION: 10% — placeholder build script only; no tsconfig, no build/test runs performed.
    - DOCUMENTATION: 35% — excellent ADRs and internal guides, but missing public README and consumer docs.
    - DEPENDENCIES: 40% — peerDependencies declared; devDependencies missing for development and audits not run.
    - SECURITY: 70% — low-code risk, but supply-chain and lifecycle-script risks need mitigation (prepare script audit, npm audit).
    - VERSION_CONTROL: 25% — unstaged/modified .voder files present; not a clean working state.
- Overall conclusion: The project has a strong design and governance foundation and one core implementation file, but lacks the necessary build/test infrastructure, public exports, automated tests, and a clean git working state to be considered complete or publishable. Hence overall status is INCOMPLETE.

## NEXT PRIORITY
- Highest priority next step (addressing the lowest-scoring areas first):
  1. Clean and stabilize version control (VERSION_CONTROL):
     - Inspect the modified .voder/* files and either commit (if intended) or discard/restore them.
     - Ensure the working tree is clean (git status shows no modified files) before pushing further changes. This unlocks reproducible commits and a clean history.
  2. Implement the minimal vertical slice to enable execution and testing (FUNCTIONALITY / EXECUTION / TESTING):
     - Add src/index.ts export barrel exposing createPostCSSConfig.
     - Add tsconfig.json (minimal) and update package.json scripts: type-check, test, test:watch, build.
     - Add a small unit test for the PostCSS factory (tests/build/postcss.test.ts).
     - Create and commit the ADR docs/decisions/0002-add-dev-deps-for-ui-tools.md (per governance).
     - Install minimal devDependencies non-interactively (typescript, vitest, @types/node, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe, postcss/autoprefixer as devDeps for development) after adding ADR.
     - Run npm run type-check and npm test; iterate until green.
     - Commit changes and push.
  3. Once the minimal slice is green, expand to:
     - Implement Vite/Vitest factories and testing utilities.
     - Add linting config factories and package scripts (lint, lint:fix, lint:md, lint:md:fix).
     - Add package exports, build pipeline, dist generation, and package-structure/export-equivalence tests.
     - Run npm audit and address issues; add verify script per policy.
- Rationale: Cleaning VC and enabling runnable tests/builds will move the lowest-scoring areas (TESTING, EXECUTION, FUNCTIONALITY, VERSION_CONTROL) into actionable, verifiable states quickly and provide the feedback loop required to continue incremental implementation.

Notes:
- The plan above aligns with the repository's existing plan and the project's policies. Implement each small step, validate (type-check/tests), commit, and push — repeat. This preserves the working-tree safety and satisfies the "implement → validate → commit → push" workflow required by the Universal Guide.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (15% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Implemented features (working / present)
  - PostCSS factory implemented: src/build/postcss.ts exists and exports createPostCSSConfig with Autoprefixer integration and sensible defaults. This fulfills the "CSS Processing: PostCSS + Autoprefixer" core piece in code (unit tests for it are not yet present but the implementation file exists).
  - Repository scaffolding and documentation are present (ADRs, decision records, prompts, .gitignore / .voderignore). These satisfy many non-code requirements and show intended architecture.
  - package.json for @voder/ui-tools exists with basic metadata and required peerDependencies declared for runtime tools (vite, vitest, jsdom, jest-axe, autoprefixer, postcss). Minimal scripts are present (prepare, voder, build placeholder).

- Missing or incomplete features (critical for functionality)
  - Public exports: The main export barrel (src/index.ts) is not present yet (the plan includes adding it). Consumers cannot import any runtime exports from the package as-is.
  - Vite library config factory (createViteLibraryConfig) is not implemented; required for "Library Build Configuration".
  - Testing support:
    - Vitest jsdom config factory (createVitestJsdomConfig) missing.
    - DOM testing helpers (renderComponent, simulateClick, etc.) missing.
    - Accessibility helpers (expectAccessible, getAccessibilityViolations, accessibilityTests) depend on jest-axe and are not implemented.
    - Test environment setup (setupJsdomTestEnvironment) missing.
    - Tests themselves (Vitest suites) are not present.
  - Linting configurations (HTML/CSS/accessibility) are not implemented in src/linting (the plan includes them but files are absent).
  - Templates folder (vitest.config.ts, vite.config.ts, test-setup.jsdom.ts) not created.
  - TypeScript project configuration (tsconfig.json) is missing; can't type-check or build package.
  - Development scripts required by the universal guide and package policy are missing (type-check, test, test:ci, lint, lint:md, verify, clean, etc.). Build script is a placeholder.
  - Tests and CI-style verification are absent; therefore none of the mandatory test categories (export tests, package-structure validation, smoke tests) are implemented.
  - ADR required for adding devDependencies for ui-tools (docs/decisions/0002...) has not been added/committed per plan; dev dependencies are not installed in package.json.
  - No compiled outputs (dist/) or build pipeline; export paths for distribution are undefined (package.json has no "exports" field).
  - No implementation of "Component Test Utilities", "HTML/CSS/Accessibility Linting", or "Accessibility Testing" code beyond the single PostCSS file.
  - PeerDependencies declared but devDependencies required to run tests/type-check/build (typescript, vitest, @types/node, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe, etc.) are not present in package.json.

- Functional implications / risk
  - The single implemented module (PostCSS factory) is useful but insufficient: the package cannot be consumed as a tooling package or used to generate Vite or Vitest configurations yet.
  - No automated verification is possible because test runner and tsc configuration are missing; developers cannot validate that exports and packaging will work for consumers.
  - Required policy/testing constraints (Vitest tests, export-equivalence, package-structure tests, markdown lint scripts) are unfulfilled.

- Overall assessment
  - Substantial documentation and a single core implementation file exist, but the package lacks the majority of runtime APIs, tests, configuration, scripts, and build infrastructure required by the specification.
  - Functionality is therefore very limited: implemented ~1 of ~12 major feature areas (≈ 8%), but considering the documentation and package scaffolding adds value, a reasonable estimate is 15% complete with uncertainty.

Recommended immediate next steps (to reach a minimally functional state)
  1. Add src/index.ts export barrel exposing createPostCSSConfig.
  2. Add tsconfig.json and minimal package scripts (type-check, test, build).
  3. Add a small Vitest test for the PostCSS factory.
  4. Add ADR documenting devDependencies and then install required devDependencies.
  5. Run type-check and tests and iterate until green.

(Those steps are in the existing plan and will raise functionality toward a useful vertical slice.)

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (45% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The single implemented source (src/build/postcss.ts) appears to follow the intended design: it exports a PostCSSConfigOptions interface and a createPostCSSConfig factory, uses autoprefixer, and documents defaults. The approach is clear and LLM‑friendly (small focused file, JSDoc, configurable overrides).
- However the codebase is incomplete for a runnable package and several quality concerns remain that prevent reliable compilation, testing, or consumption:
  - Missing public API barrel (src/index.ts) and other source files referenced by the design — the package has no consolidated exports for consumers.
  - No TypeScript project configuration (tsconfig.json) is present, so type‑checking and declaration generation cannot be run; this also means editor/CI type rules are not enforceable.
  - No tests, test config, or test scripts have been added yet — there are no automated validations to guard behavior or regressions.
  - package.json scripts are minimal/placeholder (build is an echo). The repository lacks the standard scripts (type-check, test, build) required by the guide and expected by maintainers/CI.
  - package.json devDependencies are missing typical tooling (typescript, @types/node, vitest, etc.). The PostCSS code depends on autoprefixer/postcss but those are declared only as peerDependencies — this will cause local type/compile/test failures unless installed by the consumer or added to devDependencies for development.
  - The implemented function likely returns an untyped object (no explicit return type for consumers), reducing type guarantees. Consider returning a strongly typed PostCSS.Config or adding explicit return types to improve safety.
  - No lint/format configuration or enforcement is present; code style consistency and static analysis are not yet guaranteed.
  - Edge/corner-case handling is minimal: input validation is basic (defaults only). There are no unit tests to assert plugin ordering or option propagation (important per ADR).
- Potential minor correctness note for src/build/postcss.ts (based on the described implementation):
  - Using autoprefixer({ overrideBrowserslist: browsers }) is appropriate; ensure the autoprefixer import and types are compatible with the project's TypeScript/Esm settings.
  - Ensure the returned object shape matches what consumers (Vite css.postcss) expect (PostCSS expects either object with plugins or a function). Add an explicit return type or small wrapper to guarantee compatibility.
- Overall conclusion: the implemented code follows good small-file, documented design, but the repository is missing essential configuration, build/test tooling, and exports. Until the tsconfig, public barrel, scripts, and devDependencies + tests are added and validated, the codebase is not in a working state and cannot be considered production‑ready.

Recommended next steps (short):
- Add tsconfig.json and src/index.ts export barrel.
- Add minimal devDependencies (typescript, @types/node, vitest, etc.) and standard scripts (type-check, test, build).
- Add the small unit test for createPostCSSConfig and run type-check/tests.
- Add explicit return typing to createPostCSSConfig and include a simple contract test for plugin inclusion/order.

<scratchpad>
- Review project files: package.json has no test scripts (only prepare, voder, build placeholder).
- devDependencies only reference @voder/dev-config via file:, no vitest, typescript, @types/node, etc. So test runner not installed.
- Tests directory not present (plan proposes creating tests, but not yet executed). Only src/build/postcss.ts exists (a source file added earlier) but no corresponding tests committed.
- .voder history shows plans and actions but no test runs; Git status shows modified .voder metadata files only.
- Coverage requirements in universal guide demand high thresholds (90%+), but no tests exist so coverage is effectively 0%.
- Therefore testing is minimal/absent: no automated tests run, no coverage reports, no test scripts, no verification.
- Assign a low completeness percentage; choose 10% (small progress: some source implemented and plans exist) with ±10% tolerance.
</scratchpad>

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (10% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- There are effectively no runnable tests in the repository: package.json lacks test scripts and the project has not installed a test runner (Vitest) or the typical devDependencies. Only source work (src/build/postcss.ts) exists; corresponding test files have not been committed. As a result no test runs or coverage reports exist and test coverage is effectively 0% — far short of the project's 90%+ coverage requirement.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (10% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The package has not been run or validated end-to-end. There is source work (src/build/postcss.ts) and documentation/ADRs committed, but no evidence of compilation, tests, or a completed build run.
- package.json only contains a placeholder "build" script ("echo 'Build placeholder'") and mandatory prepare/voder scripts; it does not yet include the type-check/test scripts required to validate the code. No tsconfig.json, test files, or exported barrel have been committed per the plan steps, so TypeScript build/test verification has not been performed.
- Dev dependencies for running TypeScript/Vitest/etc. have not been installed (package.json devDependencies only reference a local @voder/dev-config), so no test or type-check runs could have been executed yet.
- Git history shows commits adding docs and src/build/postcss.ts but no successful tsc/vitest output captured. Current git status shows only modifications to .voder metadata files—no build artifacts (and dist/ is gitignored).
- Conclusion: execution/build validation has not been completed; the project is still in the implementation phase with only partial source files in place and no verified build/test runs.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (35% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains strong internal documentation: a thorough set of ADRs (docs/decisions/) that clearly record design choices, and two very detailed implementation guides (prompts/development-ui-tools.md and prompts/universal-guide.md) that together describe architecture, APIs, patterns, testing and build expectations. The docs/decisions README and docs/libraries/usage/voder-dev-config.md are useful references and show good governance and rationale coverage.

- However, public-facing and consumer-oriented documentation is lacking or misplaced:
  - There is no package README.md at the package root that is self-contained and intended for consumers (installation, quick start, API examples, security posture, license note). The universal guide explicitly requires a self-contained README; that is missing.
  - There is no concise API reference (export list, types, examples) intended for consumers; the prompts files contain examples but are internal and not appropriate to surface as package README or published docs.
  - No CHANGELOG.md present (template referenced in guides but not implemented).
  - No generated or packaged .markdownlint.json, README does not exist so the mandatory markdown-lint usage/scripts are not visible per policy.
  - The existing detailed guidance is largely in prompts/ (internal) rather than in package-level README/docs that will be published or used by consumers.
  - Missing docs for package scripts, verify/clean/test commands and expected developer workflow in a visible place for contributors (though described in prompts).
  - Required README security posture, license notice and consumer-facing constraints (per the Universal Guide) are not present in a README.

- Strengths:
  - ADR coverage is excellent — decisions, rationale and consequences are well documented.
  - Implementation guide is exhaustive and will be very helpful when converted into public docs.
  - There is a docs/libraries usage doc that shows patterns for @voder/dev-config (useful cross-reference).

- Summary assessment: core design and governance documentation is high quality and thorough, but the essential consumer- and package-facing documentation (README, API reference, CHANGELOG, visible usage/scripts) is missing or only present in internal prompt files. That prevents easy consumption of the package by humans or automated publishing surfaces.

Recommended next steps (prioritized)
1. Add a self-contained README.md at the package root that includes: purpose, installation, quick start examples (imports/exports), API summary (what is exported), security posture, license/UNLICENSED notice, and where to find ADRs. Do not reference internal prompt files or relative internal paths.
2. Create an API Reference section (either in README or docs/) listing public exports and short examples (derived from prompts/development-ui-tools.md).
3. Add CHANGELOG.md (use the provided template) and a short contributing/development workflow section (scripts and verify commands).
4. Move or duplicate relevant consumer-oriented examples from prompts/ into README/docs (so published docs are self-contained) and keep prompts/ as internal design artifacts.
5. Add .markdownlint.json generation instructions and document required scripts (lint:md / lint:md:fix) in the README and package.json scripts (as required by policy).

Once those items exist, documentation coverage will move from “internal design complete / external docs missing” toward “consumer-ready” status.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (40% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- High‑level summary: Based on the package.json contents alone (peerDependencies: vite ^6.0.0, vitest ^3.2.0, jsdom ^26.0.0, jest-axe ^9.0.0, autoprefixer ^10.0.0, postcss ^8.0.0; devDependencies: local file:@voder/dev-config), I cannot definitively guarantee there are no security vulnerabilities or that the versions are the absolute latest without running registry queries and an audit. With the available static information:
  - The dependency version fields are caret ranges, which allow non‑breaking updates within the same major and generally help keep packages reasonably fresh for bug and security fixes.
  - Nothing in the listed package names is an obvious, high‑risk package historically known for active supply‑chain compromise, but that does not rule out package‑specific advisories that may exist for particular versions.
  - There is a governance note (ADR-0005) requiring exact version alignment for vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8; that is not yet reflected in package.json (no coverage provider declared). If you add the coverage provider, you must align its version exactly with vitest to avoid runtime peer dependency failures.
  - The package currently only declares peerDependencies (so consumers install the actual tool packages). That means this package itself does not pull in those tools at install time — it reduces immediate attack surface for this package but pushes responsibility to consumers to install compatible, secure versions.
  - Dev dependencies are minimal/placeholder (only a file: reference to @voder/dev-config). The repository will need dev tooling (typescript, vitest, @types/node, etc.) to run tests/type-checks locally; those must be audited when added.

- Key risks and compatibility notes:
  - Cannot assert no vulnerabilities: you must run `npm audit` / `npm audit fix` (or `pnpm audit`) in a POSIX shell to detect any known advisories for the exact resolved dependency tree.
  - Vitest / coverage provider alignment: follow ADR-0005 — if you add `@vitest/coverage-v8` or similar, ensure version alignment with vitest (tests should be added to verify alignment).
  - Node engine constraints: several docs reference Node ≥22.6.0 for native TypeScript config support; if you depend on that behavior, declare `engines.node` and ensure consumers/CI meet it to avoid runtime issues.
  - PeerDependencies only: because these are peers, consumers may pick older/insecure versions; document required versions clearly in README and consider adding automated tests that fail on incompatible/mismatched peer versions.

- Recommended next actions (high priority):
  1. Run a registry/audit check locally and print results to console:
     - npm ci && npm audit --json  (or `npm audit`), capture output to console for .voder/history.md evidence.
  2. If you add devDependencies (typescript, vitest, @types/node, etc.), run `npm audit` before committing and include ADRs for any new direct dependencies as required by governance.
  3. If you intend to use the V8 coverage provider, add `@vitest/coverage-v8` and pin it to the exact vitest version per ADR-0005; then run tests to verify no peer conflicts.
  4. Consider tightening critical peer dependency ranges to known-good tested versions (or document expected version alignment) and add automated tests that assert version compatibility for coverage tools.

- Conclusion: From static inspection alone I estimate the dependency posture is likely reasonable (caret ranges, common packages), but I cannot assert "no significant vulnerabilities." A concrete audit and resolved install are required to raise confidence. Run `npm ci` + `npm audit` and validate vitest/provider alignment to move this assessment toward 100%.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (70% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary
  - The current codebase contains no obvious, high-severity application-level vulnerabilities (no network calls, no eval/Function-from-string usage, no obvious SQL/OS injection vectors). Most code present is configuration factories, test helpers and lint/config generators which are low-risk by nature.
  - The main security concerns are supply‑chain and operational (scripts executed on install, dependency version ranges, test helpers that execute untrusted code, and potential secret exposure in console/history). These are typical for library/dev-tooling packages and should be mitigated with policy and hygiene rather than code-level changes.

- Concrete findings and recommendations

  1. Prepare / lifecycle script execution risk
     - Finding: package.json contains "prepare": "node ../../setup-package-docs.js". npm runs lifecycle scripts during installs; a prepare script that runs arbitrary JavaScript from a relative path can execute code on developer/CI machines.
     - Risk: If that script is malicious or compromised, it can run arbitrary commands at install time (high impact).
     - Recommendation: Ensure the referenced script is audited, minimal, and deterministic. Prefer no-op prepare scripts for untrusted contributors or require explicit invocation. Add a safety note to docs and/or gate execution (e.g., check environment variable). If the script is optional, avoid running it automatically during CI/consumers installs.

  2. Supply‑chain (third‑party dependency) risk
     - Finding: package.json uses peerDependencies with caret ranges (vite, vitest, postcss, autoprefixer, jsdom, jest-axe). Ranges allow installing transitive versions that may have vulnerabilities.
     - Risk: Pulling a vulnerable version upstream (medium-high). Some packages (jsdom, postcss, autoprefixer) have had advisories historically.
     - Recommendation:
       - Run `npm audit` / SCA regularly and fail CI on high/critical advisories.
       - Use lockfiles in CI and keep them up to date; consider pinning versions (or using ADRs) for security-sensitive tooling.
       - Enforce ADR-0007 recommendations: registry mirrors, automated audits, lockfile integrity checks, and periodic dependency updates.
       - Consider CI gating and scheduled dependency updates (dependabot/renovate) with security review.

  3. Lack of "engines" / Node version constraint
     - Finding: package.json currently does not enforce Node engine requirements (although docs reference Node ≥22.6.0 for TypeScript Prettier config).
     - Risk: Running on older Node can cause unexpected behavior and security issues (medium).
     - Recommendation: Add an "engines" field (e.g., "node": ">=22.6.0") and document it; fail CI or warn when unsupported Node versions are used.

  4. Tests and helpers execute consumer/component code
     - Finding: renderComponent calls component.mount(), and test templates (in later plan) use child_process.execSync/npm pack and exec to run code in temporary dirs.
     - Risk: Tests that execute untrusted or third-party code will run arbitrary JS in the test environment (medium via code-execution in CI). This is expected for unit/integration tests but must be run only in trusted CI and controlled developer machines.
     - Recommendation:
       - Ensure test suites run in isolated environments (containers/ephemeral VMs) in CI.
       - Use temporary directories with strict cleanup; avoid writing artifacts into the repo.
       - Avoid running untrusted packages during CI without verification.

  5. Console/history secret leakage risk
     - Finding: The Universal Guide enforces console-first output captured in .voder/history.md. If any scripts or tests print secrets (env vars, tokens), they end up persisted in history.
     - Risk: Sensitive data exposure in repository history (medium-high if secrets are printed).
     - Recommendation:
       - Audit any console output for secrets before committing.
       - Add checks to detect common secrets in output (CI scanning), and ensure .voder/history.md is treated carefully (not published).
       - Never log/print secrets in tests; set process.env scrubbers in test setup.

  6. Unchecked config inputs and plugin objects
     - Finding: createPostCSSConfig accepts a `plugins` array and merges it directly into the returned config. Other factories accept override objects and pipe them into tooling configs.
     - Risk: If consumers pass malicious plugin implementations (or load untrusted plugin code), those will run during build/test (medium but expected).
     - Recommendation: Document that plugin inputs must be trusted; optionally validate plugin shapes or require consumers to pass plugin identifiers (strings) rather than function instances when possible.

  7. No automated audit/enforcement in package.json scripts yet
     - Finding: The repo-wide guidance requires `verify` scripts and `npm audit fix --force` usage, but the package.json in this package currently lacks a `verify`/`type-check`/`test`/`test:ci` automation.
     - Risk: Missed automated security checks and test/coverage in local/dev CI (low-medium).
     - Recommendation: Add recommended scripts and include `npm audit`/SCA steps in CI/verify workflow.

  8. .voder directory tracked and possible sensitive metadata
     - Finding: `.voder/` files are tracked and include history and progress logs (already modified). They could contain sensitive implementation details if scripts output secrets.
     - Risk: Leak of internal data/credentials (low-medium).
     - Recommendation: Review `.voder/*` contents and ensure no secrets are present; add automated checks to prevent leaking secrets into these tracked files.

- Low‑risk code observations
  - No use of dynamic require of remote sources, no eval/Function usage, no direct OS command injections in code present.
  - Test environment setup uses vi.fn mocks and direct property definitions—standard and acceptable for unit tests.
  - No network calls, database connections, or runtime telemetry in current code.

- Priority action list (short)
  1. Audit the prepare script (../../setup-package-docs.js). If it must run at npm install, review and harden it; otherwise remove or replace with explicit opt-in.
  2. Add "engines": "node": ">=22.6.0" to package.json (if the package requires modern Node for TypeScript config) and document runtime requirements.
  3. Add automated dependency auditing (npm audit / SCA) to verify/CI scripts; run an initial audit and remediate any findings.
  4. Pin or more tightly specify versions for security‑sensitive peer/dev dependencies or document ADRs that justify ranges.
  5. Add tests / CI checks that detect accidental printing of secrets to console/history and scan `.voder/` files for secrets.
  6. Ensure any future test code that invokes child_process or npm pack uses tmp dirs and does not write into repository; verify cleanup and avoid printing sensitive data.

- Confidence / scope note
  - This assessment focuses on the repository content currently present (package.json, docs, postcss factory, and guides). It does not include ephemeral or external files (e.g., contents of ../../setup-package-docs.js, uninstalled dependency code, or future generated files). If the prepare script or any external script referenced is reviewed, additional security findings may surface.
  - Suggested completeness: 70% ±10% — I reviewed the committed sources and documentation; further dynamic checks (npm audit, SCA scans, and reviewing referenced external scripts) are required for a more complete assessment.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, publishable state because there are unstaged/uncommitted modifications in the working tree. While your local branch is synchronized with origin/main (no unpushed commits), the presence of modified files prevents the workspace from being considered fully version-controlled and ready for release.
- Specific findings:
  - Uncommitted changes (preventing completion): modified files shown by git status:
    - .voder/history.md
    - .voder/implementation-progress.md
    - .voder/last-action.md
    - .voder/plan.md
    - .voder/progress-chart.png
    - .voder/progress-log-areas.csv
    - .voder/progress-log.csv
  - Branch synchronization: "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'." → no unpushed local commits.
  - File tracking: file-tracking summary reports 24 tracked, 0 untracked — there are no untracked important files. .gitignore appears to cover build outputs and forbidden artifacts (node_modules/, dist/, logs, etc.), which is correct.
- Impact on completeness score:
  - Any uncommitted changes caps completeness at 30% (per your criteria). Because there are no unpushed commits and no untracked important files, the score is near that cap. I rate it 25% (±5%) to reflect that a small set of metadata files are outstanding and easily fixable, but they still block a "clean" VC state.
- Recommended next steps to reach >80%:
  1. Inspect the modified .voder files to confirm their intended final content.
  2. Stage and commit the deliberate changes (git add ... && git commit -m "..."), or revert if they were accidental (git restore ...).
  3. If those .voder files are transient and should not be tracked, update .gitignore or clean them from the index (but be careful: .voder metadata is intentionally tracked).
  4. After committing, run git status to confirm a clean working tree and then push (git push) if any new commits were created.
- Summary: Synchronization with remote is good, ignore patterns look correct, but the working tree has unstaged/uncommitted modifications — commit or restore those to achieve a clean, fully managed state.
