![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (68% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What’s complete
  - Core jsdom testing helpers and environment: renderComponent, simulateClick/simulateKeypress, waitForNextFrame/waitForAnimation, and setupJsdomTestEnvironment exist and are exercised by unit tests. (FUNCTIONALITY: 40%)
  - Documentation and ADRs are robust: README, multiple ADRs, and usage docs exist and describe architecture and policies. (DOCUMENTATION: 70%)
  - Dependency posture is healthy: recent versions selected, vitest and its coverage provider are aligned; an npm audit previously reported zero vulnerabilities. (DEPENDENCIES: 85%)
  - Security posture is reasonable for a tooling package; the primary risk is supply‑chain/plugin execution which the repo already documents/addresses. (SECURITY: 85%)
  - Version control is in good shape: working tree clean, branch synced to origin/main. (VERSION_CONTROL: 85%)
  - Many build/test scripts exist and earlier runs have succeeded; a prior verification succeeded before the most recent TypeScript/test import issues. (EXECUTION: 75%)

- What’s missing / problematic
  - Feature completeness: Several planned features in the UI-tools spec are not implemented or are only present in dist (not as tracked source): build factory source files, accessibility utilities, linting factories, dual exports, and the standardized scripts (lint/lint:md/format/verify). This limits full consumer and LLM-friendly behavior (FUNCTIONALITY: 40%).
  - Tests & coverage: Test coverage is narrow and misses many required test categories (export-equivalence, package-installation integration tests, build/config tests). The project policy target (≥90% coverage, public API coverage) is not met. Also, TypeScript test import issues are currently blocking a clean test run. (TESTING: 40%)
  - Code correctness issues: Two concrete quality/functional issues were found that block verification:
    1) Tests import paths end with “.ts” (TS5097) — must remove those extensions or change compiler options.  
    2) renderComponent unmount semantics remove caller-owned containers (semantic bug) and helper swallows mount/unmount errors silently. These need small single-file fixes. (CODE_QUALITY: 65%)
  - Execution reliability: The verification sequence (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) currently fails due to the TypeScript import-extension errors and the prior cleanup import problem (the latter has been fixed). Until the import fixes and any follow-on single-file issues are addressed, execution cannot be considered fully validated. (EXECUTION: 75%)

- Per-sub-assessment references
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 40% — core test helpers implemented, but many requested factories/utilities and dual export patterns missing or only present as compiled artifacts.
  - CODE_QUALITY: 65% — solid structure and intent, but concrete bugs (test imports, renderComponent lifecycle, silent catches, missing IComponent typing, inconsistent source vs dist) reduce quality.
  - TESTING: 40% — unit tests exist for helpers and setup, but major integration tests (export-equivalence, package-installation) and coverage are missing; TypeScript import errors block current test runs.
  - EXECUTION: 75% — previously succeeded but currently failing due to small issues; build artifacts exist in dist and scripts are present.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 70% — README and ADRs are good; missing a compact API reference and a few developer docs (templates, CHANGELOG, precise markdown-lint generation instructions).
  - DEPENDENCIES: 85% — recent and aligned; one minor mismatch (jest-axe peer vs dev) should be aligned.
  - SECURITY: 85% — no glaring code-level vulnerabilities; main risk is supply-chain and optional plugin execution—policies exist.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 85% — clean working tree and synced branch; confirm that ignored files (e.g., src/build/ if intended) are intentionally ignored.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Highest priority: get the verification pipeline green by fixing the small, blocking issues that scored lowest (FUNCTIONALITY / TESTING / CODE_QUALITY).

1) Fix test import-extension errors (single-file edits)
   - Edit tests/testing/helpers.test.ts: change import from '../../src/testing/helpers.ts' to '../../src/testing/helpers'
   - Edit tests/testing/setup.test.ts: change import from '../../src/testing/setup.ts' to '../../src/testing/setup'
   - Commit with an explicit single-file message (e.g., "test: remove .ts extension from imports in helpers test" and "test: remove .ts extension from imports in setup test"), push, then run:
     npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test

2) Fix renderComponent lifecycle and error visibility (single-file edit)
   - Modify src/testing/helpers.ts to:
     - Track whether the helper created/attached the container (createdByHelper boolean).
     - Append container to document.body only when createdByHelper is true.
     - Remove the container on unmount only when createdByHelper is true.
     - Replace silent catch blocks around mount/unmount with console.error(...) so errors are surfaced to stderr (console-first policy).
     - Optionally introduce a minimal IComponent interface for typing.
   - Commit with message: "fix: renderComponent only removes created container and log mount/unmount errors"
   - Push and run the verification sequence again.

3) Re-run verification (after each change)
   - After each single-file change: run npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test and observe output.
   - If additional single-file failures appear, fix them one at a time following the same cycle.

4) Once verification is green:
   - Expand tests to cover createPostCSSConfig and createViteLibraryConfig (small unit tests), then add integration tests required by the Universal Guide (export-equivalence and package-installation tests) incrementally.
   - Add missing scripts (lint/lint:fix, lint:md/lint:md:fix, format/format:check, verify) and the minimal documentation files recommended earlier (API reference and templates doc).

Rationale: the highest-impact, smallest-scope fixes are the failing test imports and the renderComponent behavior. They are one-file changes each and will unblock verification and allow work on the larger missing features and coverage targets.

If you want, I can:
- apply the exact single-file edits for the first step (remove .ts extensions in tests) and run the verification sequence, then report the results; or
- apply the renderComponent fix as the next single-file change and run verification.

Which single-file change should I make first?



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (40% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Implemented / working:
  - Core jsdom test utilities: renderComponent, simulateClick, simulateKeypress, waitForNextFrame, waitForAnimation — implemented in src/testing/helpers.ts and covered by unit tests (tests/testing/helpers.test.ts).
  - jsdom test environment setup: setupJsdomTestEnvironment implemented in src/testing/setup.ts and has a smoke test (tests/testing/setup.test.ts).
  - README and ADR documentation: package README and several ADRs exist and document intended architecture, policies, and decisions.
  - Build outputs present: compiled artifacts exist under dist/ (dist/src/index.js, dist/src/index.d.ts, and dist tests), so the package’s published entry points (main/types) reference real compiled files.
  - Package metadata and dev deps: package.json includes peerDependencies and devDependencies aligned with the guide (postcss/autoprefixer/jsdom/vitest/etc.), and basic npm scripts for build, type-check, test, prepare are present.

- Partially implemented / fragile:
  - PostCSS and Vite library factories: compiled versions are present in dist, and the public export barrel (src/index.ts) re-exports them, but source-level build files under src/build/ (postcss.ts, vite-library.ts) are not present in the repository snapshot you provided. This means source-first development and tests that import source paths may be brittle or non-existent for these factories. Consumers relying on dist will work, but source expectations from the guide (src/build/*) are not fully met.
  - Package exports: package.json exports only the main entry (".": import → ./dist/src/index.js). The recommended "dual export" pattern and dedicated subpath exports (e.g., "./testing", "./prettier", "./eslint") are not implemented, limiting granular consumer imports and tree-shaking patterns mandated by the guide.
  - Linting / formatting / markdown-lint tooling and scripts: required scripts like lint, lint:fix, lint:md, lint:md:fix, format, format:check, verify are missing or incomplete (only prepare, voder, type-check, build, test scripts exist). The guide mandates these scripts and markdown-lint setup, so the package does not yet satisfy those operational requirements.
  - Accessibility helpers (jest-axe integration) and linting config factories (HTML/CSS/accessibility factories) are specified in the design but not present in src (they are present in the guide only). Those features are planned but not implemented.
  - Dual-export equivalence and integration tests: required integration tests for package export paths and export-equivalence (per universal guide) are not present or not exercised. The package-structure test exists and validates package.json.exports point to dist files — that passes because dist contains the compiled files — but broader export-equivalence and package-installation integration tests are missing.
  - Coverage & quality thresholds: the universal testing/coverage requirements (90% thresholds, public API coverage) are not yet satisfied — current tests exercise helpers and setup only, not the broader API surface.
  - Source-level consistency: several tests currently import .ts extension paths (causing TypeScript complaints previously) — there are remnants of that and the verification loop indicates outstanding test/import path fixes were needed. This indicates the repo is close but still requires small source/test fixes to stabilize verification.

- Risk / verification status:
  - The repo has had prior successful build/test runs, but the most recent verification runs surfaced TypeScript import-extension and API import issues that required single-file fixes. The verification loop is in progress; some fixes have been committed (e.g., removing invalid cleanup import).
  - Relying on compiled dist artifacts masks missing source files for certain factories; while dist contains working JS, long-term maintenance and LLM-guided development expect source files to be present and tested.

Summary judgment:
- The project has a solid core: jsdom setup and DOM-testing helpers implemented and tested, documentation/ADRs in place, and compiled outputs that make the package consumable.
- However, many features from the specification are only partially present or entirely missing: source build factories, accessibility utilities, linting factories, dual exports, the standardized scripts (lint/format/markdown-lint/verify), and the required comprehensive tests (export-equivalence, packaging integration, coverage thresholds).
- Functionality completeness is therefore moderate: primary test helper functionality is implemented, but the full scope of the @voder/ui-tools feature set and the universal package requirements are not yet fully realized.

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (65% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The codebase is mostly well-structured and follows the project's architectural patterns (clear module barrels, separate testing helpers, test coverage intent). However there are several concrete correctness and quality issues that prevent the code from being considered fully working and clean.

Key problems and impact
- Import paths with .ts extensions in tests
  - tests/testing/helpers.test.ts and tests/testing/setup.test.ts import '../../src/... .ts'. TypeScript (with current tsconfig) rejects imports that end with .ts (TS5097) unless allowImportingTsExtensions is enabled. This is a compile/test blocker and will fail the type-check/build/test verification.
  - Fix: remove the explicit .ts extensions in test imports (use '../../src/testing/helpers' and '../../src/testing/setup'), or enable allowImportingTsExtensions (not recommended for this project).
- renderComponent lifecycle bug (functional correctness)
  - renderComponent always removes the container on unmount (container.parentNode?.removeChild(container)), even when the container was supplied by the caller and already present in the document.
  - Tests expect caller-owned containers to remain after unmount; current behavior will break those tests and is a semantic bug. The helper should track whether it created/attached the container and only remove it when created-by-helper.
- Silent swallowing of mount/unmount errors
  - The helper catches and silently ignores exceptions when calling component.mount/unmount. Silently swallowing errors hides useful diagnostics; per project policy console-first diagnostics are preferred (e.g., log to stderr) so failures in mount/unmount are visible in test output/history.
- Inconsistent module/file layout vs import specifiers
  - src/index.ts re-exports from './build/postcss.js' and './build/vite-library.js' while there is no src/build/*.ts tracked in the source tree (src/build/ appears to be git-ignored). That mismatch can be confusing for contributors and may cause resolution surprises in different environments (editor/tooling vs test runner). Favor having source files in src/build/ (tracked) or adjust imports consistently.
- Weak typing and missing IComponent contract
  - The code uses any for component types in helpers; the project documentation refers to an IComponent type but it is not present. Public APIs should expose/refence concrete types (or a minimal IComponent interface) to satisfy interface-first principles and enable stronger type-checking.
- Tests referencing source JS extension (potentially brittle)
  - tests/smoke.test.ts imports '../src/index.js' (JS extension pointing at source). This can work with the test toolchain but is brittle and inconsistent with TypeScript source files; prefer importing source modules without explicit extension or using the compiled dist in package-structure tests per the project convention.
- Minor style/consistency issues
  - Catch blocks that swallow errors, broad use of any, and a few places with // @ts-ignore reduce code clarity and safety.
  - Tests and source should consistently follow the project's module resolution conventions (NodeNext, ESM, explicit .js when referring to compiled output).

Summary judgement
- Functional correctness: Not fully correct. There are at least two failing/incorrect behaviors currently (test import extension errors and renderComponent unmount semantics) that will break verification runs.
- Testability: Tests are present and well-targeted, but a small number of test import issues and helper bugs prevent them from passing.
- Maintainability: Good high-level structure and documentation, but missing types (IComponent), inconsistent imports, and silent error handling lower maintainability and make debugging harder.
- Adherence to standards: The code mostly follows the project's ESM/TS layout and console-first philosophy, but needs fixes to error logging and typing to align fully with project guidelines.

Actionable fixes (minimal, one-file steps recommended)
1. Update tests/testing/helpers.test.ts imports to remove .ts extension.
2. Update tests/testing/setup.test.ts imports to remove .ts extension.
3. Modify src/testing/helpers.ts:
   - Track createdByHelper boolean (only append/remove container when createdByHelper is true).
   - Replace silent catch blocks with console.error(...) to surface mount/unmount errors.
   - Tighten types by adding a minimal IComponent interface.
4. Ensure src/build source files exist/tracked or make import targets consistent and documented.

After those small targeted changes the code quality will be much closer to green; current state is roughly mid-to-high 60s because structure and intent are solid but a few straightforward bugs block full correctness.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (40% ± 20% COMPLETE)
- There is a small, focused Vitest test suite in place that exercises core helper behavior and basic package integrity:
  - Unit tests for DOM helpers: tests/testing/helpers.test.ts (renderComponent, simulateClick, waitForNextFrame / waitForAnimation).
  - Test for jsdom environment setup: tests/testing/setup.test.ts.
  - Smoke test ensuring the main source barrel exports createPostCSSConfig: tests/smoke.test.ts.
  - Package structure validation: tests/package-structure.test.ts (verifies package.json exports point to dist/*).
- Current test status: historically the verification run failed due to TypeScript import issues (tests importing source with a trailing “.ts” extension and an invalid cleanup import). The repo contains fixes staged/committed for the cleanup import; the tests still include imports that end with “.ts” (helpers.test.ts and setup.test.ts) which will trigger TS5097 unless either the tests are changed to remove “.ts” extensions or tsconfig enables allowImportingTsExtensions. Until those import-path issues are resolved and a full verification run is executed, the test run is unlikely to be green.
- Coverage and scope adequacy:
  - Coverage is narrowly focused on test helpers and basic package metadata checks. Important areas missing coverage include:
    - Build/config factories (createViteLibraryConfig, createPostCSSConfig) — no unit tests in src/tests/build/* or tests/build/* are present in the tracked source.
    - Linting configuration factories (html/css/accessibility) and template files.
    - Accessibility utilities (jest-axe helpers) — planned but not implemented/tested yet.
    - Export-equivalence, package-installation integration tests, and broader API surface tests required by the Universal Guide are missing.
  - The repository currently lacks the comprehensive integration and installation tests mandated by the guide (package-installation.test.ts, export-equivalence.test.ts, etc.), so final consumer-facing guarantees are not covered.
  - The project’s policy target (>=90% coverage, full public API coverage) is not met by the present tests.
- Risk / reliability:
  - Given the current test set, regressions in the build/config factories, linting exports, or accessibility helpers would likely go unnoticed.
  - The package-structure test depends on built artifacts under dist/ (which are git-ignored but present in .voder visibility). That test can block CI unless build outputs are produced reliably before test runs; ensure build is run (pretest is configured to run build, but verification needs to be executed to confirm).
- Recommended next steps (testing-focused, small and incremental):
  1. Fix the remaining TypeScript import-path issues in tests (remove trailing “.ts” from test imports or enable allowImportingTsExtensions). Re-run the verification sequence to confirm tests run cleanly.
  2. Add unit tests for createPostCSSConfig and createViteLibraryConfig (simple shape assertions and PostCSS inclusion) — these are small gains in coverage and catch common export mistakes.
  3. Implement accessibility utilities and corresponding unit tests (jest-axe) as planned.
  4. Add the required integration tests: export-equivalence and package-installation tests (these are longer-running but required by policy).
  5. Run coverage and iterate until coverage thresholds meet project policy.
- Summary judgment: the testing foundation is present and targeted at core helpers and package metadata, but overall test coverage is limited and incomplete. Work is needed to fix existing TypeScript test import issues, expand tests to cover build/config factories, accessibility/linting exports, and add the mandated integration tests to approach the repository’s quality goals.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (75% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The project is mostly implemented and many verification steps have succeeded in prior runs (TypeScript compilation, builds, and Vitest runs passed at earlier points). The repository contains compiled outputs in dist/, a valid package.json with build/test scripts, and comprehensive tests. However the most recent non-interactive verification failed and the current state is *not* fully validated: a TypeScript check failed (TS5097) due to test files importing source modules with a trailing `.ts` extension, and those test-import extension issues remain in the working tree. One earlier TypeScript error (invalid named import of cleanup from @testing-library/dom) was fixed and committed, but the remaining `.ts`-extension import errors prevent a clean type-check / build / test sequence now. Therefore the build/test scripts are not reliably passing in the current repository state and full verification (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) will fail until the test import paths are corrected (and any other single-file failures revealed after that are addressed).

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (70% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains solid foundational documentation: a clear, consumer-facing README.md with quick start, examples (vite, vitest, PostCSS), security posture, and verification steps; a set of MADR ADRs under docs/decisions that document design choices and dependency rationales; and a couple of library-usage pages (docs/libraries/usage/*) that add useful context (PostCSS and dev-config usage). The implementation guides in prompts/development-ui-tools.md are thorough and include API-like descriptions and examples for the main helpers (PostCSS factory, Vite factory, Vitest jsdom factory, testing helpers, linting configs).

- What’s good
  - README is well written, self-contained, and consumer oriented (no internal links), with examples and security notes.
  - ADRs are present and comprehensive — they document decisions relevant to the package and inherited policy choices.
  - There are useful usage pages for related tooling (dev-config) and for PostCSS.
  - The prompts/development-ui-tools.md contains detailed API descriptions and examples (very helpful for implementers and reviewers).

- Gaps / missing or incomplete items
  - No explicit, dedicated API reference pages for package exports (e.g., a docs/api.md or typed reference that lists each exported function, its full options signature, default values, and return shape). Consumers and integrators rely on examples but not a compact reference.
  - The in-repo API-level documentation is split between README, docs/usage, and prompts/ (the latter is an internal prompt asset). Relying on prompts/ for API docs is fragile because README must remain public-facing and prompts/ is an internal artifact.
  - No documented examples or instructions for the mandatory markdown lint generation flow (.markdownlint.json generation) beyond a short mention in README — the repo relies on the prepare script but lacks an example or the generated file in docs to show expected content/behaviour.
  - Template files under templates/ are referenced in the design doc but there's no human-oriented docs page describing their purpose and when/why to copy/use them.
  - No CHANGELOG.md present (the template is referenced by the universal guide but not instantiated here).
  - No concise "Developer reference" section documenting package scripts and expected local workflow (verify workflow is mentioned but the exact scripts like lint/lint:md/format/verify are not all present in package.json or fully documented).
  - No generated API docs nor typed docs (e.g., a simple docs/api.md referencing TypeScript types) to make the public surface easy to scan without reading source.

- Recommended minimal next steps (small, incremental, low-risk)
  1. Add an API reference doc (docs/api.md) that lists the public exports (createPostCSSConfig, createViteLibraryConfig, createVitestJsdomConfig, renderComponent, testing utilities, lint config factories) with short signatures, default values, and brief examples. This is one file → one commit.
  2. Add docs/usage/templates.md that lists and explains the files in templates/ and shows a copy/paste example for consumers (one file → one commit).
  3. Add a short docs/dev-workflow.md describing the exact npm scripts, local verification sequence, and how to generate `.markdownlint.json` (one file → one commit).
  4. Create a CHANGELOG.md from the provided template (even a placeholder with instructions) so release notes have a known location (one file → one commit).

- Overall judgement
  - The existing documentation is strong on rationale (ADRs) and has practical examples in README and the implementation prompt. However, it lacks a compact API reference and a few developer-facing convenience docs (templates, markdown-lint generation, CHANGELOG) that would make the package easier to adopt and maintain. Addressing those missing, small docs will move the project toward complete, discoverable, and maintainable documentation.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall status: Dependencies look current and intentionally selected for this UI tooling package. The repo history indicates an npm audit run that reported zero vulnerabilities at the time the deps were installed, and the core toolchain (TypeScript, Vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8, jsdom, postcss/autoprefixer, testing-library) uses recent, compatible releases—so there are no obvious, high‑risk or stale packages present.
- Security: Per the recorded history a full npm audit was run with no reported vulnerabilities. That’s a strong signal, but not a permanent guarantee — continue to run automated audits regularly and monitor advisories for transitive deps.
- Compatibility / alignment:
  - Good: Vitest and its coverage provider are version‑aligned (devDependency vitest ^3.2.4 with @vitest/coverage-v8 ^3.2.4) as required by ADR-0005 — this avoids the common “Cannot find module '@vitest/coverage-v8'” and peer alignment problems.
  - Good: postcss (8.x) and autoprefixer (10.x) are present and the dev/peer versions are consistent (devDeps provide concrete versions that satisfy the peer ranges).
  - Issue to fix: jest-axe is declared in peerDependencies as ^9.0.0 but devDependencies include ^10.0.0. That mismatch can lead to confusing peer warnings for consumers or subtle API incompatibilities in tests. Align the peer and dev versions (either bump peer to ^10 or pin dev to ^9) depending on intended consumer compatibility and ADR guidance.
  - Note: vite is declared as a peer (^6.0.0). If Vite 6 is still speculative for some consumers, that may force consumers to upgrade; this is a policy choice but worth verifying against the broader monorepo consumer matrix.
- Risk factors & recommendations:
  - Keep running npm audit / dependabot/renovate checks and apply security patches for transitive dependencies regularly.
  - Resolve the jest-axe peer/dev version mismatch to avoid consumer install-time warnings or runtime differences in the accessibility helpers/tests.
  - Reconfirm peer ranges (vite, vitest, jsdom, prettier, etc.) are intentionally set to the ranges you want consumers to install; document any exact‑version constraints in ADRs as required by the repo policy.
  - Because most packages are devDependencies (tooling only), supply‑chain risk is lower at runtime, but CI and developer machines still need vigilance.
- Conclusion: No immediate, high‑severity issues found. With the single corrective action (align jest-axe versions) and continuing routine audits, the dependency set is healthy and compatible with the package goals.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary
  - I found no obvious active vulnerabilities in the repository code (no use of eval, no raw child-process spawning in production code, no network calls, no direct file writes to repo paths). The package is a developer-tooling library (build/test helpers), so most risky operations are confined to development-time code and optional plugin loading. The largest security exposure is the supply chain (npm dependencies and optional plugins) and the runtime execution of third‑party plugin code when present.

- Notable risk areas
  1. Supply‑chain / dependency risk (highest risk)
     - Many devDependencies and peerDependencies (vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, postcss, autoprefixer, jsdom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2, testing-library, etc.). Any of these could contain vulnerabilities or malicious releases. The repo contains ADRs and notes about supply‑chain auditing and registry mirrors — good — but this remains the primary attack surface.
     - Mitigation: enforce lockfile usage, regular `npm audit` in CI, supply‑chain scans (Snyk/OSSF/other), and the existing registry‑mirror/audit policies described in ADRs.

  2. Dynamic plugin import in vite.config.ts
     - The config dynamically imports an optional plugin ('vite-plugin-inline-source') and will execute its default export if present. If a malicious or compromised plugin is installed in the dev environment, this will execute arbitrary code at config load time.
     - Mitigation: restrict/verify optional plugin installation, prefer whitelisting vetted plugins, run builds in constrained CI environments, and review installed plugin versions (pin or use signed artifacts where possible).

  3. Use of child-process / exec in example/test snippets (potential future risk)
     - Several documentation/test examples (in prompts/docs) show use of execSync to pack/install and run Node scripts. Those examples are not currently part of runtime code, but similar patterns if introduced into tests or scripts (and run automatically) could be abused or cause command injection if user-controlled input is passed.
     - Mitigation: avoid running shell commands with untrusted input; when necessary use safe argument arrays and avoid shell interpolation.

  4. DOM helpers & handling untrusted HTML
     - renderComponent and test helpers manipulate jsdom and expect consumers to pass component instances or DOM nodes. If these helpers are used with untrusted HTML/content, there is a risk of DOM-based XSS or leaking test-runner environment details (e.g., when tests log DOM contents).
     - Mitigation: document that helpers are for controlled test inputs only; require consumers to sanitize untrusted markup before testing; avoid using innerHTML anywhere (current code does not).

  5. Silent error swallowing in helpers
     - renderComponent currently swallows exceptions during mount without reporting. While not a direct security flaw, this can hide unexpected behavior and delay discovery of issues. The plan already suggests improving logging.
     - Mitigation: log errors to stderr (console.error) so test harnesses and auditors can detect anomalies.

  6. Test environment mocks & globals
     - setup.ts sets global mocks (IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver, matchMedia) using vitest vi.fn(). This is fine in tests but ensure test-only code is not shipped in production consumers. Tests should run in isolated environments; global mocks should not leak into consumer runtime.
     - Mitigation: ensure test setup is only used by tests and not executed in production.

- Code constructs causing low/medium concerns
  - No direct file writes to the repository (policy enforced). Good.
  - package.json is private + UNLICENSED (no accidental public publishing). Good.
  - TypeScript config includes "declaration": true (produces .d.ts in dist), but dist/ is gitignored — OK.
  - Requiring Node >= 22.6.0 and use of experimental flags for Prettier config (per ADR) is not a security vulnerability but requires care in CI/OS setup.

- Recommendations (practical)
  1. Strengthen supply‑chain controls:
     - Ensure lockfiles are committed and CI validates them.
     - Run `npm audit`/SCA in CI on every change and fail builds on critical/high issues.
     - Use the ADR's registry‑mirror policy and make CI use an internal mirror / vetted registry.
  2. Pin or tightly constrain versions for security‑sensitive dev tools (or add automated alerts for upgrades).
  3. Vet optional plugins before allowing them in dev environments; consider a plugin‑whitelist for CI.
  4. Improve error visibility:
     - Log mount/unmount errors in renderComponent to stderr so failures are visible in CI logs.
  5. Sanitize and document:
     - Clarify in README and helper docs that DOM helpers are for controlled test inputs and not for untrusted HTML.
  6. Limit shell/exec usage:
     - If you add tests that call external commands (execSync), ensure no user-controlled data is passed to shell and run in sandboxed CI workers.
  7. CI isolation: run tests/builds in isolated containers with limited network access where possible.

- Conclusion
  - There are no glaring code-level security vulnerabilities (injection, auth leaks, unsafe file writes) in the committed source. The primary concerns are supply‑chain risk and executing third‑party plugin code during configuration/build steps; these are typical for tooling packages and are already addressed by ADRs and policies in the repository. Following the mitigations above will materially reduce the remaining risk.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (85% ± 5% COMPLETE)

- The repository is in a clean, synchronized state: git reports "nothing to commit, working tree clean" and "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'". There are no staged/unstaged changes and no local commits waiting to be pushed — so points for 1) ALL CHANGES COMMITTED and 2) ALL COMMITS PUSHED are satisfied.

- Proper file‑tracking / ignore hygiene is mostly correct:
  - Build outputs (dist/), node_modules/, prompt-assets/, and other tool artifacts are present in the git‑ignore list — this is correct and intentional for a TypeScript package.
  - .voder/ has been untracked and added to .gitignore, which matches the project policy to keep those working files out of VCS.

- One caution that reduces the completeness score: some project/source/test files appear to be intentionally git‑ignored (listed under "Git-ignored files"):
  - src/build/ and tests/build/vite-library.test.ts are in the gitignore list. The project summary and implementation guide expect src/build and tests/build entries (build config factories and their tests). If those are supposed to be source or test files, being git‑ignored is potentially incorrect and should be reviewed.
  - The file-tracking summary shows "Project files tracked: 27/33" and "Total git-ignored files: 6" — ~6 project files are ignored. If those ignored files are intentionally build outputs or temporary, that's fine; if any are legitimate source or tests accidentally ignored, they must be unignored and committed.

- Specifics:
  - Uncommitted changes: none (working tree clean).
  - Unpushed commits: none (branch up-to-date with origin/main).
  - Untracked important files: none reported as untracked, but several project files are git-ignored (src/build/, tests/build/vite-library.test.ts). This is the main reason the assessment is not 100%.

Recommendations (single-step):
- Confirm whether src/build/ and tests/build/ files are intended to be ignored. If they are source or test files, remove them from .gitignore, git add and commit them.
- If they are intentionally ignored (build artifacts/templates), leave as-is; consider documenting the rationale in an ADR or README to avoid accidental omissions.

Summary: version control hygiene is strong (clean working directory, all commits pushed), but the presence of several project files in .gitignore (27/33 tracked vs 33 expected) warrants a quick verification. If those ignored files are intentional build artifacts, the repository is effectively 100% healthy; if not, unignore and commit them to reach full completeness.
