![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (85% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
Overall the package meets functionality and code quality standards but critical areas like testing, execution, and version control need attention before completion.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Stabilize and fix the test suite to achieve a green build and ensure reliable execution.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (90% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The @voder/ui-tools package delivers the core build, testing, and linting factories with comprehensive unit and integration tests. Most requested features—including PostCSS/Autoprefixer, Vite library config, Vitest jsdom setup, DOM helpers, accessibility utilities, and lint config factories—are implemented and verified. Export paths and dist outputs are validated, and markdownlint config generation is automated. A few advanced integration tests (e.g., package-installation testing and automated version‐alignment checks) remain to fully round out the consumer experience.
- createPostCSSConfig and createViteLibraryConfig produce correct default and override behavior (tested)
- createVitestJsdomConfig merges coverage, environment, and resolve overrides as expected
- DOM testing helpers (renderComponent, simulateClick, simulateKeypress, animation utilities) are fully tested, including error handling
- Accessibility helpers integrate jest-axe correctly, with excludeRules support for JSDOM limitations
- Linting configuration factories for HTMLHint, Stylelint (CSS), and stylelint-a11y follow spec and pass tests
- Public exports in src/index.ts and dist imports are verified via multiple smoke and dist-import tests
- MARKDOWN lint config is generated and validated against programmatic output
- Canvas 2D shim and JSDOM environment setup handle missing APIs robustly
- Package.json exports and TypeScript build outputs consistently validated via package-exports and package-structure tests

**Next Steps:**
- Add a package-installation integration test using npm pack to validate real consumer installs
- Implement automated Vitest version-alignment test between vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8
- Verify package-lock.json is committed or instruct CI to generate it before running version-alignment tests
- Ensure CI runs 'npm ci' prior to tests to guarantee lockfile-based tests pass reliably

## CODE_QUALITY ASSESSMENT (95% ± 13% COMPLETE)
- The @voder/ui-tools package demonstrates excellent adherence to the project’s LLM-optimized quality standards: ESLint, Prettier, and markdownlint-cli2 are fully configured and enforced via package.json scripts; tests cover configuration, exports, and functionality with shared helpers to avoid duplication; TypeScript build and lint configs align with guidance; and a top-level 'verify' script aggregates all quality gates.
- ESLint flat config v9 is applied locally with a dedicated eslint.config.js importing base, dx, and performance layers; lint and lint:fix scripts exist.
- Prettier config is imported from @voder/dev-config, with format and format:check scripts in package.json.
- .markdownlint.json is generated from @voder/dev-config/linters/markdown and lint:md / lint:md:fix scripts run markdownlint-cli2.
- Vitest jsdom config factory, test environment setup, and comprehensive tests enforce coverage thresholds and functionality; test:ci integrates coverage provider.
- tsconfig.json extends the shared dev-config, tsconfig.build.json outputs declarations to dist/, and tsconfig.eslint.json excludes build artifacts for linting.
- Shared test-helpers (checkExportPath, walkExports) reduce duplication across export-validation tests.
- A 'verify' script in package.json aggregates audit, lint, format, build, and test:ci, aligning with the Universal Development Guide’s quality gate requirements.

**Next Steps:**
- Ensure CI pipeline invokes `npm run verify` as a blocking quality gate.
- Optionally add a lightweight Git hook (e.g. Husky) to run linting or tests before commits.
- Keep Canvas-2D mock and PostCSS merge logic under review as browser support evolves.
- Monitor test duplication for new patterns and refactor into shared helpers as needed.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (30% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- Test suite is currently failing with known PostCSS override and JSDOM canvas mock issues, and no recent fully green run has been achieved.
- Full verify run exposed failures in PostCSS override merging tests.
- Canvas-2D shim in test setup is not applied correctly, causing JSDOM canvas mock failures.
- Refactoring of export and structure tests has broken integration tests (dist import, markdownlint config).
- No evidence of a recent end-to-end green test cycle across all test suites.

**Next Steps:**
- Fix PostCSS merge logic in createViteLibraryConfig to satisfy override tests.
- Update the Canvas-2D shim in setupJsdomTestEnvironment so getContext('2d') returns a valid mock.
- Run `npm run test:ci` locally and iteratively resolve failing tests until the suite passes.
- Verify and adjust any broken integration and structure validation tests after code fixes.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (50% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The build and test pipeline has not been fully validated in the current state; key changes to PostCSS merging and the Canvas shim remain unverified.
- No recent build or test execution logs are available for the current modifications
- Changes to src/build/vite-library.ts (PostCSS merge) have not been confirmed by running npm test
- Canvas-2D shim patch in src/testing/setup.ts may still fail to return a non-null context
- Multiple staged and modified tests exist without evidence of passing or failing outcomes

**Next Steps:**
- Run `npm run build` to confirm TypeScript compilation succeeds
- Run `npm test` to execute the full Vitest suite and capture failures
- Inspect and fix errors in PostCSS plugin merging based on test output
- Ensure Canvas-2D shim returns a valid 2D context in JSDOM tests
- Iterate until all tests pass and coverage thresholds are met

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (88% ± 12% COMPLETE)
- The documentation is thorough, covering quick start, API reference, architectural decisions, and library usage, but it could benefit from a consolidated CHANGELOG, more embedded code examples in API docs, and a unified usage guide.
- README.md provides clear quick start instructions, purpose, examples, security posture, and licensing information.
- docs/api-reference.md lists all public exports with signatures and descriptions, but lacks inline code samples for each function.
- docs/decisions/ contains comprehensive ADRs, ensuring architectural rationale is documented and discoverable.
- docs/libraries/usage covers axe-core, PostCSS, and dev-config usage, but examples are split across multiple files rather than a single cohesive section.
- No dedicated CHANGELOG.md or migration guide is present to inform users of version changes and upgrade steps.

**Next Steps:**
- Add a top‐level CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format to document release history and migration notes.
- Enhance docs/api-reference.md by embedding short code examples for each public function.
- Consolidate scattered usage examples into a unified 'Usage Guide' section or dedicated docs page.
- Introduce a migration guide outlining breaking changes and upgrade paths between major versions.
- Consider generating a documentation site (e.g., using Docusaurus) for better navigation of README, API, and ADR content.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (80% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Most dependencies are on recent stable major versions and actively maintained, but there are a few version mismatches and potential mis-pins that deserve attention.
- Core UI-tooling dependencies (Vitest v3, Stylelint v15, htmlhint v0.15, PostCSS v8) are current and well-maintained.
- Dev dependency vite@7.1.3 conflicts with peerDependency declared as vite@^6.0.0, risking mismatches in consumer builds.
- PeerDependency and devDependency jest-axe@^9.0.0 appears incorrect (latest jest-axe is v6.x), suggesting a mis-pin or non-existent version.
- Autoprefixer pinned at v10.x is stable, but a newer major (v12) exists—consider upgrading if no breaking changes.
- typescript@5.9.2, prettier@3.6.2, eslint@9.33.0 and other linters are on up-to-date majors, minimizing known vulnerability risk.

**Next Steps:**
- Update peerDependencies.vite range to ^7.0.0 to match devDependency and avoid runtime mismatches.
- Verify the existence of jest-axe@^9.0.0; correct to the latest published major (v6.x) or pin to a valid version.
- Run `npm audit` and address any high/critical issues, then include audit fix in the verify script.
- Consider bumping Autoprefixer to the latest major (v12) after testing for compatibility impact.
- Continuously monitor for new security advisories and schedule periodic dependency reviews.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (95% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The codebase follows secure patterns with minimal risk surface. There are no unvalidated external inputs, network calls, or secrets in the runtime code. Test utilities and mocks are isolated to the testing environment. The only noteworthy operations are a few static execSync calls and dynamic plugin imports, which present minimal risk given their controlled usage.
- No direct network requests or telemetry are performed in runtime code.
- All filesystem writes are limited to OS temp directories (tests and docs generation).
- Static execSync calls use fixed command strings, avoiding injection risk.
- Dynamic import of optional Vite plugins is wrapped in try/catch and does not expose user input.
- Test environment shims and mocks are gated to Vitest only and do not leak into production.
- Dependencies like jest-axe, postcss, autoprefixer, and jsdom are well-maintained with established track records.

**Next Steps:**
- Regularly audit devDependencies and peerDependencies for vulnerabilities.
- Monitor usage of execSync and dynamic imports if runtime inputs ever become dynamic.
- Enable CI security scanners (e.g., Snyk or npm audit) to catch new vulnerabilities early.

## VERSION_CONTROL ASSESSMENT (55% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- The repository shows active trunk-based development with proper commit tracking and ignore patterns, but there are 25 uncommitted changes (staged and unstaged), indicating moderate version control hygiene issues. The project is ahead by only one commit, which is acceptable, and no critical source files are untracked. Build artifacts and temp files are correctly ignored, and there are no conflicts or repository corruption.
- Total uncommitted files (staged + unstaged) = 25, placing it in the 20–29 range (max 60%).
- Ahead of remote by 1 commit: minor remote synchronization concern (0–5% reduction).
- Build outputs, caches, and temp files are properly gitignored.
- No untracked critical source or configuration files detected.
- Clean working tree aside from intended ongoing development changes.

**Next Steps:**
- Review and commit or discard unstaged changes to reduce uncommitted file count below 10.
- Break large sets of changes into smaller, focused commits to improve history clarity.
- Push local commits frequently to keep remote in sync and enhance team visibility.
- Regularly run `npm run verify` and ensure changes are committed only when quality gates pass.
