![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (57% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What’s complete:
  - Core foundation is present and working: TypeScript compiles, build artifacts (dist/) exist, the compiled entry exports createPostCSSConfig and the two existing Vitest tests (package-structure + smoke) pass. Execution pipeline (type-check, build, tests) has been validated and is operational (EXECUTION 95%). Dependency alignment for vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 is intentional and in place (DEPENDENCIES 85%). ADRs and decision documentation are comprehensive (DOCUMENTATION partial).
  - Code correctness for the implemented slice is high and tests for that slice pass (CODE_QUALITY 82%).

- What’s missing / failing:
  - Large portions of the package spec are unimplemented: Vite library factory, Vitest jsdom config, DOM testing helpers, accessibility utilities, linting config creators, template files, dual exports and many public APIs described in the implementation guide. FUNCTIONALITY is therefore low (25%).
  - Test surface is extremely small and does not meet project requirements or coverage goals (TESTING 15%). There are no integration/package-installation/export-equivalence tests or coverage-collecting CI tests.
  - Version control is not clean: there are unstaged/modified files (.voder metadata) in the working tree (VERSION_CONTROL 25%). This violates the "all changes committed" and "clean working state" criteria.
  - Consumer-facing docs and scripts required by the universal guide are missing (README, CHANGELOG, lint/format scripts, markdownlint generator). DOCUMENTATION scored 45%.
  - Some dependency declarations need reconciliation (e.g., jest-axe peer/dev mismatch) and an audit should be run to confirm no security advisories remain (DEPENDENCIES 85%, SECURITY 80%).

- Reference to sub-assessments:
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 25% — only PostCSS factory exported and tested; most required features absent.
  - CODE_QUALITY: 82% — implemented code is correct and compiles; repo lacks mandated linting/format enforcement artifacts.
  - TESTING: 15% — only two small tests exist; coverage and required test categories missing.
  - EXECUTION: 95% — build/test pipeline for implemented slice works reliably.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 45% — ADRs and some library docs present; consumer README, changelog, and usage docs incomplete.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 85% — modern and aligned, but run `npm audit` and reconcile jest-axe peer/dev mismatch.
  - SECURITY: 80% — no obvious code vulnerabilities, but supply‑chain/lifecycle script risks should be operationalized via CI audits and reviews.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 25% — unstaged .voder changes present; repo not in a clean, publishable state.

## NEXT PRIORITY
- Highest priority: restore a clean, verifiable version-control & verification state.
  1. Commit or stash the unstaged .voder changes, push to remote, and run the full verification pipeline:
     - git add .voder/* && git commit -m "chore: update .voder metadata" (or stash if those files should not be committed)
     - git push origin main
     - npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr
  2. If verification fails, use the single-file-fix loop: identify the single highest-priority failing file, fix it, commit only that file, and re-run verification until green.

Rationale: VERSION_CONTROL (25%) and TESTING (15%) are the weakest areas and block safe, repeatable development and further feature work. Cleaning the git state and running the verify pipeline will surface the actionable failures to fix next (tests, missing exports, scripts). Once the repo is clean and verification is green, proceed to implement missing features and tests in small, test-driven commits (starting with Vite factory and Vitest jsdom config + their unit tests), then add required scripts and README/markdown-lint generation.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (25% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Implemented core minimal feature:
  - createPostCSSConfig implemented and exported from src/index.ts (and compiled in dist).
  - TypeScript project is configured (tsconfig.json -> declarations + outDir).
  - Basic build and test scripts exist (build, type-check, test, test:ci).
  - Two Vitest tests present and runnable: package-structure.test.ts and smoke.test.ts (these validate exports point to dist and that the dist entry exports createPostCSSConfig).
  - Safe/guarded vite.config.ts present to avoid optional plugin failures during startup.
  - ADRs and documentation for decisions exist (docs/decisions/*), and package.json contains sensible peer/dev dependency declarations for many required tools.

- Verified behaviours:
  - Type-check and build complete (project compiles to dist).
  - The provided tests exercise the minimal public API and package export structure and pass (historical run shows green).

- Missing / incomplete items required by the specification:
  - Many major package responsibilities from the @voder/ui-tools spec are not yet implemented:
    - Vite library configuration factory (createViteLibraryConfig) not present in src/build (no source file listed here).
    - Vitest jsdom configuration factory (createVitestJsdomConfig), testing helpers, accessibility utilities, and test environment setup are not available in src (only referenced in docs).
    - Linting configuration creators (HTML/CSS/accessibility) are documented but not present as committed source files.
    - Templates (vitest.config.ts, vite.config.ts example template under templates/) and many utilities noted in spec are missing as real source files.
  - Dual export strategy and dedicated export paths (./testing, ./build, ./eslint, ./prettier) are not implemented in package.json exports; only the root dist entry is exported.
  - Required standard scripts and quality gates are missing or incomplete:
    - lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix, and the mandatory verify script are not present.
    - The markdownlint generator script and `.markdownlint.json` generation are not implemented.
  - Testing coverage, quality and integration tests are incomplete:
    - No export-equivalence tests, package-installation (npm pack -> install) integration tests, or smoke tests for the broader API surface.
    - No tests enforcing dependency/version alignment or coverage thresholds across the package suite.
  - Public API surface is minimal (only PostCSS export) while the spec expects many exports (build factories, testing utilities, linting configs, helpers).
  - README/CHANGELOG/public consumer docs per README-isolation policy are not present.
  - Mandatory linting configuration files (eslint.config.js, prettier.config.js per dev-config) are not present.
  - Coverage and public API coverage targets (≥90% and 100% public API coverage) are not met / not implemented.
  - Some repo hygiene requirements (e.g., verify script, engines field, markdown-lint integration) listed in the plan are not yet applied.

- Risk / correctness notes:
  - The implemented subset (PostCSS factory + export + basic tests) is coherent and tested; build & test pipeline for those pieces is green.
  - The project is structurally scaffolded to support further work, with ADRs and docs in place, but most functional responsibilities described in the implementation guide remain unimplemented.
  - Because many features are absent, consumers cannot use this package for UI testing, Vite library config, linting generation, or accessibility utilities yet.

Summary: The repository contains a correct, tested minimal foundation (PostCSS config export, build/test setup, and packaging checks) but only a small fraction of the full @voder/ui-tools feature set is implemented. Significant work remains to reach the full specification (testing utilities, Vite factory, linting configs, scripts, dual exports, integration tests, and documentation).

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (82% ± 8% COMPLETE)
- The implementation appears functionally correct: TypeScript compiles, the distilled entry in dist/ is importable, and the provided Vitest smoke + package-structure tests run (per the recorded history). The core API (createPostCSSConfig) is exposed and tests that rely on the compiled entry pass. TypeScript strictness is enabled and import-extension patterns (".js" in source) are consistent with NodeNext/ESM output.

  Issues and quality concerns to address:
  - Dependency declarations are inconsistent/duplicated: several packages (e.g., postcss, autoprefixer) appear in both peerDependencies and devDependencies which is confusing and may cause install/versioning surprises for consumers.
  - package.json exports are minimal (only "." → ./dist/src/index.js). The repository-level conventions recommend richer dual-export entries (including explicit "types" in exports or dedicated subpaths) for config packages — current setup is workable but incomplete versus the guide.
  - Repository is missing several mandatory tooling artifacts per the project's standards: no committed eslint.config.js / prettier.config.ts / .markdownlint.json / lint:md and format scripts (these are required by the universal guide). That reduces automated quality enforcement.
  - tsconfig includes prettier.config.ts in "include" but the file is not present — harmless for tsc but signals divergence from expected artifacts.
  - Some helper code (DOM helpers) assumes browser-like globals (requestAnimationFrame) which may not always be present in all test runtimes unless explicitly polyfilled in setup — watch for flaky tests if those helpers are used without setup.
  - Minor stylistic/consistency items: a lightweight header comment and mixed code formatting across files; no ESLint/Prettier rules are enforced yet so style consistency depends on author discipline.
  - Coverage and testing requirements in the guide (90% thresholds, extensive integration tests) are not met yet — current test surface is small, so code correctness is verified only for a subset of expected behaviour.

  Overall: the code is working and tests pass for the implemented slice, but repository-level quality and the full set of required configurations and scripts are incomplete. Address the dependency declaration issues, add the mandated lint/format configs and scripts, and extend tests (integration/export-equivalence/package-installation and coverage checks) to reach the higher quality bar mandated by the project.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (15% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains a very small, focused Vitest suite (tests/package-structure.test.ts and tests/smoke.test.ts). The last recorded verification run reports the test runner completed successfully: 2 test files, 2 tests — both passed.
- Tests exercise only two things: (1) package.json exports point to files under dist/ (package-structure test) and (2) the compiled entry (dist/src/index.js) exports createPostCSSConfig (smoke test). Those tests are valuable smoke and structural checks but cover only a tiny fraction of the package surface.
- Coverage is not reported in the recent run (test:ci with coverage was not run as part of the successful verification reported), and the current test set will yield very low code coverage. The project’s stated requirements (≥90% overall, 100% of public API) are not met.
- Missing test categories (per the project guide):
  - Unit tests for build config factories (vite-library, postcss) and linting config creators.
  - Unit tests for testing utilities (helpers, accessibility) and setup code.
  - Export-equivalence and package-installation integration tests (npm pack → install → import).
  - Dependency/version-alignment tests (e.g., vitest vs @vitest/coverage-v8).
  - Smoke and API surface tests beyond the single createPostCSSConfig export.
- Tests are currently passing, but the test surface is too small to be considered sufficient. To reach policy compliance and the project's coverage targets, the test suite needs many more unit, integration, and coverage-collecting CI-style tests.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (95% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The package builds and tests run successfully: TypeScript type-check (tsc --noEmit) completed, tsc -p tsconfig.json produced dist/, and Vitest executed the test suite (smoke + package-structure) with all tests passing. The compiled entry (dist/src/index.js) exists and the smoke test verifies the primary export. package.json exports are pointing to dist/ artifacts that exist. Minor housekeeping remains (unstaged .voder metadata changes and some recommended scripts/configs from the universal guide are not yet added), but they do not block build/test execution—overall the build & test pipeline is validated and working.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (45% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository has strong decision/ADR coverage (docs/decisions/) and some targeted library usage docs (docs/libraries/usage/postcss.md and voder-dev-config.md) plus in-repo implementation guides (prompts/*) and example snippets — these provide good rationale and some usage examples. However the package lacks a public, self-contained README.md for @voder/ui-tools (required by the README isolation policy), there is no CHANGELOG.md, no published API reference or generated docs for the public exports, and key consumer-facing artifacts (prettier/markdown-lint generation scripts, README usage examples consolidated in a package README, and template documentation) are missing. Tests and templates exist but are not documented for consumers. Overall: design/decision documentation is strong, but consumer-facing documentation (README, API reference, changelog, installation/usage, and markdown-lint config generation instructions) is incomplete — creating those items would move this to a high-completeness state.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall the dependency set appears reasonably current and mostly consistent: TypeScript (5.9.x), Vitest (3.2.x) and the V8 coverage plugin are aligned per the ADR, Autoprefixer/PostCSS are on 8/10 series, jsdom is on 26.x, and testing helpers (Testing Library, jest-dom) are recent versions. That indicates active maintenance and deliberate version alignment for the test toolchain.
- Positive signals:
  - Vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 are version-aligned (devDeps: vitest ^3.2.4 and @vitest/coverage-v8 ^3.2.4) — this was an ADR requirement and mitigates a common runtime failure.
  - TypeScript is modern (5.9.x) and tsconfig is set to NodeNext — good for ESM + modern tooling.
  - Autoprefixer / PostCSS are present in both peerDependencies and devDependencies with compatible ranges.
- Notable concerns / risk items:
  - Peer vs dev version mismatch for jest-axe: package.json lists jest-axe as a peerDependency ^9.0.0 but devDependency ^10.0.0. This could cause consumer installs to get warnings or runtime incompatibilities if 10.x introduced breaking changes. Review and reconcile (choose a single supported range and document via an ADR if necessary).
  - Vite is declared as a peerDependency (^6.0.0). Ensure that consumers (and CI) will have a Vite version compatible with your intended config; major-version peers can surface incompatibilities.
  - I cannot determine actual security vulnerabilities from the repository alone — no npm audit output or CVE scan was run here. While versions look modern, some packages (build/test tooling and CLI helpers) occasionally receive security advisories; a proper audit is required to be certain.
- Recommendations (next steps to reach 100% confidence):
  1. Run dependency checks locally/CI: `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` and `npm outdated` to get precise vulnerability and freshness reports.
  2. Reconcile the jest-axe peer/dev mismatch (either relax the peer range or align dev dependency) and commit an ADR if changing peer ranges or introducing exact pins.
  3. Ensure package-lock.json is up-to-date and include a periodic audit step in the verify workflow.
  4. Consider adding an automated dependency-scan or scheduled `npm audit` in CI to catch newly disclosed vulnerabilities.
- Conclusion: No obvious legacy or severely out-of-date packages stand out from package.json, and key test-tool versions are intentionally aligned — but run `npm audit`/`npm outdated` to confirm there are no pressing security issues and fix the jest-axe peer/dev mismatch.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (80% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- Overall summary: The repository is a development/tooling package (private, ESM, TypeScript) that contains mostly static configuration code, small utility factories, and test helpers. There are no obvious high‑severity coding vulnerabilities (no raw eval/use of untrusted input, no network calls, no credential files committed). The primary security concerns are supply‑chain risk from dependencies and small runtime execution surfaces (npm lifecycle scripts and optional plugin loading). Below are detailed findings and concrete mitigations.

Major findings / risks
- Supply‑chain / dependency risk (primary):
  - The package lists many peerDependencies and devDependencies (vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, postcss, autoprefixer, jsdom, markdownlint-cli2, etc.). Even though many are devDependencies, consumers/CI may install peer deps and tooling. Malicious or vulnerable versions in the dependency tree are the largest risk vector.
  - Recommendation: enforce lockfile integrity (package-lock.json committed), run automated audits (npm audit / third‑party SCA), and keep dependencies updated. The repo already contains ADRs about supply‑chain audits and registry mirrors — ensure they are enacted in CI and when onboarding contributors.
- Lifecycle script execution risk:
  - package.json defines a "prepare" script (node ../../setup-package-docs.js). npm lifecycle scripts execute arbitrary code during install; untrusted modifications to those scripts or their dependencies can run arbitrary code on contributors' machines and CI agents.
  - Recommendation: restrict execution of lifecycle scripts to trusted contexts, review prepare scripts contents, avoid running installs from untrusted sources, and document prepare expectations. Consider gating script execution in CI or validating the script via tests.
- Dynamic import of optional plugin (vite.config.ts):
  - The vite.config.ts dynamically imports an optional package ('vite-plugin-inline-source') and if present will instantiate it. Loading a plugin executes its code, which is a direct execution surface if a malicious package with that name exists in node_modules (supply‑chain or accidental installation).
  - Recommendation: avoid automatic execution of arbitrary optional plugins without explicit allowlist or verification. If optional plugins are supported, require they be declared in package.json devDependencies (so they are reviewed) or validate package identity (e.g., check package.json author/sha) before invoking.
- Committed build artifacts (dist/) history:
  - Historically dist/ was tracked; committed build artifacts may accidentally include sensitive content or create confusion about which files are authoritative. While this is more of an operational risk, committed artifacts can expose implementation details and increase attack surface if the artifacts are published inadvertently.
  - Recommendation: keep dist/ in .gitignore (already present) and confirm history removal is complete; ensure CI publish uses clean builds with validated artifacts.
- Use of jsdom and testing libraries:
  - jsdom executes HTML/CSS/JS in the testing environment. If tests create DOM from untrusted input, this could lead to executing attacker-controlled markup in the test runner environment. Current code does not parse untrusted network input, so risk is low.
  - Recommendation: continue isolating test inputs, avoid fetching remote HTML in tests, and run tests in ephemeral CI sandboxes.
- Lack of explicit Node engine constraint:
  - The docs/ADRs reference Node >= 22.6.0 for native TS config loading, but the package.json does not include an "engines" field. Mismatched Node versions can lead to running code under unsupported runtimes which may have security implications (e.g., missing Node security fixes).
  - Recommendation: add an "engines" field (e.g., "node": ">=22.6.0") to package.json and enforce in CI.
- Potential masking of runtime errors / silent failures:
  - Several try/catch blocks swallow errors (vite optional plugin import). While this is used to improve robustness, blanket swallowing may hide supply‑chain or misconfiguration problems.
  - Recommendation: log a clear warning to stderr when optional modules are present but fail to initialize (so CI/maintainers can detect strange behaviour), while still continuing safely.

Minor findings / best practices
- Principle of least privilege for scripts:
  - Keep npm scripts minimal and avoid executing arbitrary shell commands that could be abused. Prefer explicit, reviewed Node scripts written in TypeScript where possible (the universal guide mandates Node.js scripts in TypeScript for build steps).
- Dependency pinning / ADRs:
  - For critical test tooling (vitest + coverage provider) ADRs already require exact alignment. Continue to pin/align versions where peer compatibility matters and document rationale in ADRs. Add automated tests that assert alignment.
- Audit and CI enforcement:
  - Ensure npm audit / SCA runs in CI and that the project fails the verify pipeline when critical vulnerabilities are present. The repo already has ADRs about supply‑chain audits — implement them as automation.
- Secrets & sensitive files:
  - .gitignore excludes typical secrets (.env) — continue enforcing that no secrets are committed and add pre‑commit or CI checks to detect secrets.
- Code injection through configuration:
  - Config‑generation patterns exist (e.g., scripts that write .markdownlint.json or other config). Ensure any generation code sanitizes inputs and does not execute templates from untrusted sources.

Conclusion and recommended immediate actions
1. Ensure package-lock.json is committed and CI enforces lockfile integrity + npm audit (supply‑chain ADRs must be operationalized).
2. Review and minimize prepare and other lifecycle scripts; document and/or restrict their execution; add tests for setup-package-docs.js if it runs automatically.
3. Add "engines": { "node": ">=22.6.0" } to package.json and ensure CI uses that Node version.
4. Replace silent catch blocks that swallow plugin initialization errors with structured stderr warnings so supply‑chain/plugin issues are visible.
5. Keep dist/ out of VCS (ensure it is fully removed from the index/history if sensitive) and ensure CI builds from source only.
6. Add automated tests/assertions that verify critical dependency alignment (vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8) and fail CI on mismatch.

Given the repository contents and policies/ADRs already present, the codebase shows conscientious attention to supply‑chain and tooling governance; following the immediate actions above further reduces the remaining attack surface.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, publishable state: there are unstaged/modified files in the working tree, so not all changes are committed. Although commits appear synchronized with the remote, the presence of uncommitted modifications prevents the repo from being considered properly managed end-to-end.
- Specifics:
  - Uncommitted changes: Git status shows 7 modified files (all under .voder: .voder/history.md, .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md, .voder/progress-chart.png, .voder/progress-log-areas.csv, .voder/progress-log.csv). Because ANY uncommitted change lowers completeness, the assessment is capped at the low end.
  - Unpushed commits: Branch is "up to date with 'origin/main'" — no unpushed local commits were reported, so synchronization with remote is OK.
  - File tracking / ignores: .gitignore includes build artifacts (dist/, coverage/, etc.). The team attempted to remove tracked dist/ files from the index (git rm --cached -r dist/ was run). The project shows no untracked important files in the status output; .voderignore correctly negates dist/ for LLM visibility while dist/ remains gitignored. Overall file-tracking policy appears correct.
- Conclusion: Because there are unstaged/modified files, the repository fails the "ALL CHANGES COMMITTED" and "CLEAN WORKING STATE" criteria. Fix: commit or stash the .voder changes (or otherwise reconcile them), then re-run verification/push. Once the working tree is clean and commits remain synchronized, the version-control completeness score will rise significantly.
