## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (34% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What’s complete
  - Documentation & governance: Strong ADRs and implementation guides are present (docs/decisions/, prompts/*) — Documentation assessment was 40%.
  - A focused implementation exists for one factory: src/build/postcss.ts (PostCSS + Autoprefixer). This is the only concrete runtime artifact and it appears well written — contributes to CODE_QUALITY (40%) and FUNCTIONALITY (15%).
  - Dependency intent is documented in package.json (peerDependencies) and ADRs; dependency choices align with project policies — DEPENDENCIES scored 60%.

- What’s missing / blocking completion
  - Public API & packaging: No src/index.ts export barrel, no package.json exports, no build process producing dist/, so consumers cannot import the package or use the implemented factory via package root — FUNCTIONALITY only ~15%.
  - TypeScript toolchain & scripts: No tsconfig.json, no standardized scripts (type-check, test, build, verify), and devDependencies not installed — blocks type-checking and test runs — EXECUTION 10%, CODE_QUALITY limited.
  - Tests and coverage: No Vitest test suites or CI-style tests committed; coverage is effectively 0% — TESTING is 5%.
  - Additional factories & utilities: createViteLibraryConfig, testing utilities (vitest-jsdom, helpers, accessibility, setup), linting factories, utils, templates and their tests are not implemented — large portion of the required API surface is missing.
  - Version control cleanliness: There are unstaged modifications (.voder/* files) preventing a clean working tree — VERSION_CONTROL 25%.
  - Security lifecycle caution: A prepare lifecycle script is present in package.json pointing to ../../setup-package-docs.js — this is a caution point needing verification — SECURITY 78% (good overall, but lifecycle scripts need care).

- Reference of assessment areas and scores:
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 15% (single PostCSS factory implemented; most features missing)
  - CODE_QUALITY: 40% (implemented parts are high quality, but infra missing)
  - TESTING: 5% (no tests present or running)
  - EXECUTION: 10% (no builds/tests executed; no tsconfig/devDeps)
  - DOCUMENTATION: 40% (excellent ADRs/guides; missing README/CHANGELOG/package docs)
  - DEPENDENCIES: 60% (intent documented; not installed/verified)
  - SECURITY: 78% (good posture; lifecycle and SCA steps recommended)
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 25% (unstaged changes; working tree not clean)

## NEXT PRIORITY
The highest priority is to make the package a minimal, testable vertical slice so tests/type checking can run and the working tree can be committed. Focus on the lowest-scoring, blocking areas first:

1. Restore a clean repository state (VERSION_CONTROL)
   - Inspect the 7 modified .voder files and either commit or discard the changes so the working tree is clean. (A clean working tree is required before further commits.)
   - Commit message suggestion: "chore(ui-tools): update voder tracking files" (non-interactive git add/commit).

2. Add the minimal TypeScript/test/build infra (EXECUTION / TESTING / FUNCTIONALITY)
   - Create src/index.ts exporting the existing createPostCSSConfig and its type.
   - Add tsconfig.json (strict, ESNext, target ES2022, include src and tests, declaration true).
   - Update package.json scripts:
     - "type-check": "tsc --noEmit"
     - "test": "vitest run"
     - "test:watch": "vitest"
     - "build": "tsc -p tsconfig.json"
   - Keep changes small and one-step-at-a-time.

3. Install minimal devDependencies (non-interactive) and validate (TESTING / DEPENDENCIES)
   - Install: typescript, vitest, @types/node, postcss, autoprefixer, @testing-library/dom, jest-axe (single npm install --no-audit --no-fund --save-dev ...).
   - After install, run:
     - npm run type-check
     - npm test
   - Fix any immediate type or test failures.

4. Add a unit test for the PostCSS factory (TESTING / FUNCTIONALITY)
   - Create tests/build/postcss.test.ts to assert createPostCSSConfig() returns plugins array with autoprefixer behaviour or plugin presence.
   - Run tests and iterate until green.

5. Harden lifecycle script and SCA checks (SECURITY / DEPENDENCIES)
   - Confirm ../../setup-package-docs.js exists and is safe; if it does not exist, change prepare to a safe no-op until validated.
   - Run npm audit and review package-lock.json; add audit checks to the verify pipeline later.

6. Commit the minimal vertical slice and push
   - Files to commit: src/index.ts, tsconfig.json, package.json (scripts), tests/, package-lock.json (from npm install), and any safe .voder commits from step 1.
   - Commit message suggestion: "feat(ui-tools): add PostCSS export, tsconfig, test infra and PostCSS unit test"
   - Push to origin/main.

Rationale: Completing the minimal infra and test for the PostCSS factory will unlock automated validation and raise FUNCTIONALITY, EXECUTION, TESTING, and CODE_QUALITY scores quickly. Once this vertical slice is green and committed, proceed incrementally to implement the other factories, tests, and the standardized scripts required by the Universal Guide.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (15% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Implemented features
  - PostCSS factory implemented (src/build/postcss.ts) with sensible defaults and autoprefixer integration; this is the only concrete runtime implementation present that directly matches the specification.
  - Documentation and ADRs for UI tools and inherited policies are in place (docs/decisions and descriptive prompts), which define required behavior and tests but are not runtime functionality.
  - .gitignore and .voderignore are configured according to repository policies (prevents forbidden file creation and exposes dist/ for LLM inspection).

- Partially addressed items (present but incomplete)
  - package.json exists and declares the package name, type module, peerDependencies (vite, vitest, jsdom, jest-axe, autoprefixer, postcss). However the scripts and devDependencies are minimal/placeholder and do not provide the necessary developer workflow.
  - Dev-config linkage exists as a file:../dev-config devDependency, but no actual build/test scripts or dev tooling are installed to exercise any functionality.

- Missing / Not implemented (critical for functional completeness)
  - Core API surface missing:
    - No main export barrel (src/index.ts) exporting createPostCSSConfig or any other APIs.
    - No implementation of createViteLibraryConfig (vite-library.ts) despite being required by the spec.
    - No testing utilities: vitest-jsdom.ts, helpers.ts, accessibility.ts, setup.ts are absent (only documented).
    - No linting factories: html.ts, css.ts, accessibility linting factories are not present (except as documented in prompts).
    - No utils (file-utils.ts, config-utils.ts), no templates, no tests.
  - Testing & verification missing:
    - No tsconfig.json present; TypeScript compilation/type-checking cannot be run.
    - No Vitest configuration or test scripts; no unit tests exist in the repository to verify behavior (only test examples in the docs).
    - No test coverage, no package-structure or export-equivalence tests as mandated.
  - Packaging & build:
    - No build script that compiles TypeScript to dist/, no build pipeline to produce dist/ artifacts.
    - package.json exports are not defined (no dual-export strategy implemented).
    - dist/ directory is empty/absent (and required tests that assert exports point to dist/ cannot pass).
  - Developer tooling & scripts:
    - Missing standardized scripts (verify, clean, lint, format, lint:md, test:ci, type-check, etc.) required by the Universal Guide.
    - DevDependencies required for development (typescript, vitest, @types/node, testing libraries, postcss/autoprefixer as devDeps) are not installed.
  - Accessibility & DOM testing:
    - No runtime wiring for jest-axe integration or testing-library helpers; accessibility helpers are only present in docs.
  - Documentation & usage:
    - README.md and CHANGELOG.md for the package are missing; required "prepare" and "voder" scripts exist but other mandatory scripts are absent.
  - Policy & compliance:
    - ADRs exist as documentation, but the codebase does not yet implement the mandated automated tests that enforce peer/version alignment (e.g., Vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8), nor does it include package-installation integration tests.

- Overall assessment
  - The project currently contains only the PostCSS implementation and comprehensive documentation/decision records. That single implemented factory is valuable but is a very small fraction of the requested package capabilities.
  - The package is not functionally usable by consumers: there is no export barrel, no build outputs, no tests, and insufficient scripts and devDependencies to validate or publish the package (publish is external, but build/test must be present).
  - Many required automated validations (Vitest tests, TypeScript type-checking, package-structure tests) are missing, so the success criteria from the Universal Guide (interface compliance, test coverage, build verification) are unfulfilled.

- Recommendation (functional gaps to address next)
  - Add src/index.ts to export the existing createPostCSSConfig and begin the public API.
  - Add tsconfig.json and minimal package.json scripts (type-check, test, build).
  - Add unit tests for the PostCSS factory and install minimal devDependencies so tests/type-check can run.
  - Implement the remaining factories and test suites incrementally (vite-library, vitest-jsdom, helpers, linting factories), ensuring each small change is validated with tests before committing.

Summary: Functionality is minimal — implemented PostCSS factory plus comprehensive docs/ADRs — but most runtime features, tests, build, and developer tooling required by the package specification are not implemented. Completion is low (roughly 15%).

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (40% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains solid documentation and ADRs and a focused implementation of src/build/postcss.ts (as described in the history). That PostCSS factory appears well‑structured, uses autoprefixer correctly, exposes sensible defaults and an extension point (plugins) and—from a code perspective—has no obvious logic bugs.
- However the codebase is an incomplete vertical slice: many required artifacts are missing (no src/index.ts public barrel, no tsconfig.json, no tests, no build/test/type-check scripts). Because those are missing the package cannot be type-checked, built, or tested as-is, so end‑to‑end correctness cannot be verified.
- package.json is minimal and currently lacks the standardized scripts required by the guide (type-check/test/build/verify etc.). devDependencies only reference a local file dependency (@voder/dev-config: "file:../dev-config") which will fail for consumers or CI unless that sibling package exists; this makes installs brittle in isolation.
- ESM/TypeScript concerns:
  - The overall repo is ESM ("type": "module"). The posted TypeScript examples and planned exports use .js extensions in imports for ESM output; that is correct for compiled output but requires a proper tsconfig and build step to avoid resolution/runtime errors. Those build steps are not present yet.
  - The PostCSS file uses a default import of autoprefixer which is standard; no issues apparent there.
- CI/test readiness: no Vitest config or tests are committed, so test coverage and behavior are unknown. Accessibility helpers and other utilities mentioned in docs do not exist yet in the tree, so the public API surface is not implemented.
- Quality tooling: there is no ESLint/Prettier/markdown lint config present in the package root (only ADRs prescribing them). Without these, formatting and linting enforcement are not in place; this increases risk of style/consistency problems later.
- Repository hygiene is good (comprehensive .gitignore and .voderignore), which reduces risk of accidentally committing build outputs or logs.
- Summary judgment: small, well-written pieces are present and appear correct (notably postcss factory), but the implementation is incomplete and lacks supporting infra (TS config, exports/barrel, scripts, tests). This prevents meaningful validation and leaves the package in a partially implemented state with installation/build fragility (local file devDependency). Recommend finishing the minimal vertical slice (index barrel, tsconfig, scripts, devDependencies, and unit test) to raise quality quickly.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (5% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- There are currently no formal test suites or test runner scripts configured in package.json (no "test"/"test:ci" scripts), and the repository does not contain a tracked tests/ directory or Vitest/Jest configuration. A single implementation file (src/build/postcss.ts) exists, but no unit or integration tests were added for it. As a result: no tests are running, nothing is passing, and code coverage is effectively 0%. This falls far short of the project's stated requirements (Vitest-based tests, export/integration/package-structure tests, and the 90%+ coverage targets). Next steps: add Vitest and related devDependencies, tsconfig, test scripts, and the minimal tests (start with tests/build/postcss.test.ts) and iterate until tests and coverage targets are met.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (10% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains initial source stubs and docs (e.g., src/build/postcss.ts) but the package has not been built or validated: there is no tsconfig, no test scripts installed/run, devDependencies required for type-checking/testing are not installed (package.json only contains a placeholder build script), and no Vitest runs or type-checks have been executed. Consequently, the software has not been executed or verified — build and test workflows are currently non-functional until the tsconfig, test files, scripts, and devDependencies are added and run.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (40% ±10% COMPLETE)
- The repository has strong decision-level documentation (MADRs in docs/decisions/) and an extended implementation guide for @voder/ui-tools in prompts/development-ui-tools.md, plus a usage-oriented docs file for @voder/dev-config. These capture architecture choices, rationale, and intended APIs/config patterns — a solid foundation for maintainers and LLMs. However, critical consumer-facing and developer-facing docs are missing or incomplete for this package: there is no package README.md in the package root (public, self-contained README required), no CHANGELOG.md, no concise API reference or generated docs for exported functions/types, and no .markdownlint.json / docs-generation artifacts that would support the mandated markdown linting workflow. Usage examples exist inside internal prompts and docs for another package (dev-config) but are not surfaced as a packaged README or API doc for @voder/ui-tools. In summary: design/decision documentation is excellent; practical, consumable package documentation (README, examples, API reference, changelog, markdown-lint config) is largely absent — hence partial readiness for both consumers and contributors.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (60% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The package.json lists only peerDependencies (vite ^6.0.0, vitest ^3.2.0, jsdom ^26.0.0, jest-axe ^9.0.0, autoprefixer ^10.0.0, postcss ^8.0.0) and a local devDependency (@voder/dev-config: file:../dev-config). At a high level these are modern-looking major versions (and match the project's ADR guidance), but I cannot verify actual package freshness or CVE status from the repo files alone. Important caveats and risks:
  - No automated vulnerability scan output was provided (npm audit not run), so the absence of known vulnerabilities cannot be asserted.
  - Caret (^) ranges allow newer patch/minor releases to be installed; this is usually fine but can unintentionally pull in versions with new vulnerabilities or breaking peer-dependency changes—pinning or using a lockfile + periodic audit is recommended.
  - The package currently lacks explicit devDependencies for the tooling referenced in the docs (typescript, vitest, @types/node, etc.), relying on @voder/dev-config (local) to provide them. That means the real installed dependency graph depends on the dev-config package contents; those transitive deps must be inspected/audited as well.
  - The ADRs mention exact alignment requirements for vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 — that constraint increases risk if versions are left floating; consider pinning or ensuring coordinated updates and adding tests that assert version alignment.
  - Without running npm audit / SCA tooling and inspecting the lockfile, I estimate confidence at ~60%: dependencies look intentionally chosen and up-to-date per project docs, but security posture and transitive risk are unverified.
- Recommended next steps (console-first verification): run npm ci (or npm install), then npm audit (and npm audit --json), review package-lock.json for unexpected transitive versions, and add automated audit checks to the verify pipeline; if vitest coverage provider requires exact versions, pin them or add tests to ensure alignment.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (78% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- No obvious remote-network or data-exfiltration code paths are present in the implemented source (src/build/postcss.ts, testing helpers/specs in docs). Most code is configuration factories and test helpers that run in-process or under test harnesses, which reduces attack surface.
- The package is private and marked "private": true and "UNLICENSED", which prevents accidental npm publish — good for minimizing accidental exposure.

Primary security concerns and recommendations
1. Lifecycle script safety (high risk)
   - package.json contains a "prepare": "node ../../setup-package-docs.js" script. Any lifecycle script executed during npm install can run arbitrary code on a developer's machine or CI agent. If that file is missing or replaced, running install/prepare could fail or execute arbitrary code.
   - Recommendation: Make lifecycle scripts explicit and safe. Either:
     - Change prepare to a no-op or guarded script that checks for existence and exits gracefully, or
     - Ensure ../../setup-package-docs.js is reviewed, deterministic, and not modified by untrusted sources.
   - Before running installs on CI or untrusted machines, audit lifecycle scripts.

2. Use of child process execution in test examples (moderate risk)
   - The documentation and example tests show use of execSync/npm pack/npm install for package-installation integration tests. Running shell commands from tests can be dangerous if any inputs are variable/untrusted.
   - Recommendation: In tests that invoke shell commands, avoid interpolating untrusted values into the shell, run commands with explicit args (no shell interpolation), enforce timeouts, and confine operations to temporary directories. Prefer Spawn with options and avoid shell:true where feasible.

3. Supply-chain and dependency risk (moderate → high depending on versions)
   - package.json currently lists peerDependencies (vite, vitest, jsdom, jest-axe, autoprefixer, postcss) but devDependencies are minimal/local. The repository contains ADRs requiring supply-chain audits and registry mirror policies, which is good practice, but the current codebase should still:
     - Ensure lockfile is present and used in CI (npm ci), run `npm audit` (and triage), and enable automated SCA scans.
     - Pin or carefully constrain versions for tools that have breaking peer requirements (e.g., vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8 alignment).
   - Recommendation: Enforce CI checks for npm audit, use lockfiles checked into repo, run vulnerability scanning (SCA) and dependabot-like automation, and document trusted registry mirrors.

4. Secrets / sensitive files
   - .gitignore includes .env, but the project notes that already-tracked sensitive files should be removed from the index. Verify no secrets have been committed:
     - Run `git ls-files --stage | grep -i .env` and inspect history for secrets.
   - Recommendation: If any credentials/secrets are in history, use git-crypt or remove via BFG/git-filter-repo and rotate credentials.

5. Test and example code execution policies
   - Some example integration tests create temporary packages and call `node`/`npm` to execute files created at test time. Running these end-to-end tests in CI or on developer machines should be sandboxed to avoid unexpected side effects.
   - Recommendation: Ensure these tests run in ephemeral temp dirs, are non-interactive, and are optional in developer workflows; consider gating them under `--integration` flag so quick developer runs don't execute long-running shell installs.

6. Input sanitization and DOM handling (low → moderate risk)
   - The testing helpers avoid innerHTML usage (good). renderComponent appends to document.body and calls component.mount/unmount. If components accept or render untrusted HTML, tests could inadvertently allow XSS-style payloads during test runs.
   - Recommendation: Continue to avoid innerHTML and clearly document that components in tests should not render untrusted strings without sanitization.

7. Mocking and global overrides
   - setup.ts assigns global mocks (IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver, matchMedia). That’s fine for test environments, but ensure that tests restore/isolates global state where necessary to avoid cross-test contamination.
   - Recommendation: Keep afterEach cleanup strict (already present) and avoid persisting mocks outside test scope.

8. File-system write policies (policy compliance)
   - The project enforces "console-first" and forbids repository artifacts. Tests/examples that create files use OS temp directories — this is good. Continue ensuring no tests or scripts write non-ignored files into repo working tree.

9. Developer tooling and engine requirements
   - ADRs recommend Node >= 22.6.0 for native TS config loading. Ensuring engines field in package.json and CI agent config matches reduces unexpected behavior and attack surface from mismatched runtime behavior.
   - Recommendation: Add `"engines": { "node": ">=22.6.0" }` once you validate CI and contributors use compatible runtimes.

Summary
- The codebase shows generally good security hygiene: no obvious unsafe data-sinks, avoidance of innerHTML, use of temp dirs in examples, ADRs acknowledging supply-chain audits.
- The most significant security exposure is the use of lifecycle scripts (prepare) and any child process usage that could execute code during installs or test runs. Addressing lifecycle script safety, enforcing SCA/lockfile usage, and hardening tests that invoke shell commands will materially reduce risk.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The repository is NOT in a clean, publishable state: there are uncommitted modifications in the working tree which must be addressed before considering the repo fully managed. Although local commits appear to be synchronized with the remote (branch is "up to date with 'origin/main'"), the presence of unstaged changes prevents a clean working state and blocks a complete assessment.
- Specifics: Git status reports 7 modified files not staged for commit (modified: .voder/history.md, .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md, .voder/progress-chart.png, .voder/progress-log-areas.csv, .voder/progress-log.csv). There are no unpushed commits (branch up to date) and no untracked important files (0 untracked files). .gitignore appears to properly cover build/output artifacts (node_modules/, dist/, build/, logs, etc.), which is correct. To reach a clean >80% score you must commit or discard the unstaged changes so the working tree is clean and then ensure any new commits are pushed.
