![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (53% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What’s complete
  - Project scaffold, metadata and governance are in place: package.json, tsconfig, .gitignore/.voderignore, ADRs, and internal guides are present and aligned with the design intent.
  - A minimal, correct PostCSS factory implementation exists and is exported (src/build/postcss.ts → src/index.ts). The repo contains defensive patterns (guarded vite.config.ts) and some initial Vitest tests and scripts.
  - Dependency selection and alignment look reasonable and an earlier npm audit returned zero vulnerabilities.

- What’s missing or broken
  - Core package functionality remains largely unimplemented: many modules from the implementation guide are missing (vite-library factory, vitest-jsdom factory, testing helpers, linting configs, templates, utilities, dual exports, mandatory scripts). This is the main functional gap.
  - Tests are too few and currently failing as a collective verification: tests that assert package.json → ./dist/ artifacts will fail until a build is performed or test ordering is fixed. Coverage is far below target (project requires high coverage; current coverage is effectively nil).
  - Test orchestration/build ordering is brittle: package-structure tests require compiled dist/ artifacts, but test scripts do not guarantee build-before-test, causing verification failures.
  - Developer-facing documentation (README, CHANGELOG, DEVELOPMENT notes, API reference) is missing; existing docs are strong on ADRs and internal policy but insufficient for consumers/contributors.
  - Version control is not clean: staged and unstaged .voder metadata changes exist in the working tree, preventing a publishable/synchronized repository state.
  - While security posture and dependencies are generally good, lifecycle scripts (prepare) and wide dev dependency surface increase supply-chain risk and warrant audit/lockfile enforcement.

- Reference findings by area
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 20% — only the PostCSS factory and basic export barrel implemented; most requested APIs and features are unimplemented.
  - CODE_QUALITY: 75% — source code is generally correct and defensively written; test orchestration and small polish items reduce the score.
  - TESTING: 15% — few tests exist, package-structure test currently blocks suite because dist/ artifacts are missing; coverage is far below requirements.
  - EXECUTION: 60% — tsc/vitest wiring exists and has worked previously, but the canonical verification currently fails; one or two issues (import extension, missing build artifacts) block a clean run.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 60% — excellent internal ADRs and guides, but missing consumer README, CHANGELOG, and concise developer instructions.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 90% — versions are recent and aligned; earlier npm audit showed no vulnerabilities; minor peer/dev alignment items noted (e.g., jest-axe).
  - SECURITY: 70% — no obvious code-level vulnerabilities; supply-chain/lifecycle-scripts are the main concerns and should be audited.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 30% — staged + unstaged changes present; branch is pushed but working tree is not clean.

## NEXT PRIORITY
Highest-priority next step(s) to unblock progress (perform exactly one atomic change first, then re-run verification):

1. Commit the staged .voder metadata files to produce a clean working tree (fix VERSION_CONTROL 30% → required).
   - Reason: a clean repo is prerequisite for reproducible verification and for making further focused changes. The current staged + unstaged .voder files prevent a clean, publishable state.

2. Immediately after committing, run the canonical verification and capture console output:
   - npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test
   - Reason: this single verification run will reveal the single highest-priority runtime/test failing condition (most likely the package-structure test failing because dist/ files are not present).
   - If the verification fails, diagnose the single cause and apply exactly one targeted remediation (e.g., run npm run build to create dist/ and re-run tests; or fix a single import extension). Re-run the canonical verification after that one remediation.

Rationale for this next step chain:
- The lowest-scoring areas are TESTING (15%) and FUNCTIONALITY (20%), but both are blocked by the repository not being in a clean state and by the verification ordering (build before tests). Committing .voder files cleans version control (allowing safe CI/verification runs) and running the canonical verification exposes the exact single remediation required (build artifact or small test fix). This follows the project’s prescribed diagnose → one-remediation → verify loop.

If the canonical verification passes after the above:
- Proceed with incremental implementation of missing modules (one module + tests per commit, e.g., implement createViteLibraryConfig and its tests next), and add missing scripts (lint, lint:md, verify) and README/DEVELOPMENT.md in small, atomic steps — running the verification after each change.

Notes:
- Do not make multiple unrelated changes at once. Follow the project plan: commit the .voder files now, run verify, then perform exactly one targeted remediation if tests fail, re-run verify, repeat.
- The overall status is INCOMPLETE because several areas scored well below 95% and the test/verification pipeline is not yet passing end-to-end. Once the working tree is clean and the canonical verification succeeds, the next priorities are expanding tests and implementing the missing APIs per the implementation guide.



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (20% ±10% COMPLETE)
- Implemented core scaffolding and metadata
  - package.json, tsconfig.json, .gitignore/.voderignore, ADRs and documentation files are present and align with the design intent.
  - Dev and peer dependencies are declared in package.json (devDependencies include vitest, typescript, postcss, autoprefixer, testing libraries, etc.).
  - Basic build/test scripts exist in package.json (type-check, build, test, test:ci, clean, prepare, voder).

- Minimal runtime functionality implemented
  - src/build/postcss.ts implementing createPostCSSConfig with Autoprefixer exists and is exported via src/index.ts. This satisfies a single requested feature (PostCSS + Autoprefixer factory).
  - A guarded vite.config.ts is present to avoid optional-plugin startup failures.

- Tests and verification scaffolding exist but are incomplete
  - tests/package-structure.test.ts and tests/smoke.test.ts are present and exercise package structure and a smoke check.
  - However, the package.json exports point to ./dist/src/index.js and types to ./dist/src/index.d.ts. There is no compiled dist/ output committed (and dist/ is gitignored). The package-structure test expects compiled artifacts in dist/, so without running the build the test will fail.
  - Many mandatory test categories from the guide are missing: export-equivalence tests, package-installation integration tests, vitest-jsdom tests, build config tests, accessibility tests, etc.

- Major requested features not implemented yet
  - Vite library configuration factory (src/build/vite-library.ts) is missing.
  - Vitest jsdom config factory (src/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts) and all testing helpers (helpers.ts, accessibility.ts, setup.ts) are not present in src/.
  - Linting configuration factories (src/linting/html.ts, css.ts, accessibility.ts) are not present in the repository.
  - Templates directory (templates/*) and many utilities (utils/*) are not present.
  - Dual-export strategy (additional exports like "./testing", "./postcss", "./linting") is not implemented in package.json exports.
  - Mandatory scripts (lint, lint:fix, format, lint:md, lint:md:fix, verify) required by the universal guide are not present.
  - Markdown lint generation script and .markdownlint.json are not present.

- Packaging & export correctness issues
  - package.json exports and types point to dist/ paths but dist/ is not built, so consumers and package-structure tests will fail until a build is produced and/or package.json exports are adjusted.
  - The smoke test imports ../src/index.js (an ESM .js extension) while the source is TypeScript (src/index.ts). Vitest can run TypeScript, but the ESM import extension may cause resolution issues without the expected build output or test runner configuration. This was a previously observed source of TypeScript/module-resolution errors in history.

- Overall assessment vs. requirements
  - The repository contains accurate project metadata, ADRs, some docs, and a single working API (PostCSS factory). However, the bulk of the package's functionality — Vite config, Vitest jsdom config, DOM testing helpers, accessibility utilities, linting configs, templates, comprehensive tests, and the required package scripting/export patterns — remain unimplemented.
  - Because the package.json points to compiled artifacts that are not produced yet, the mandatory package-structure validation and many integration tests will fail until the build step is performed and additional modules are added.

Summary: The project has a correct scaffold and one implemented library function (PostCSS factory) but is far from feature complete. Most of the package APIs, tests, and required scripts described in the implementation guide are still missing. Progress is roughly 20% toward the stated functional goals; substantial implementation and testing remain.

<scratchpad>
Observations from repo snapshot:
- src/index.ts is minimal exporting createPostCSSConfig from './build/postcss.js'.
- tsconfig.outDir = "dist" and TypeScript NodeNext module resolution; compiled sources will be under dist/src/...
- package.json "main"/"types"/exports point to dist/src/index.js and dist/src/index.d.ts which matches tsc output layout (src/ → dist/src/).
- tests/package-structure.test.ts asserts that package.json exports point to files under ./dist/ and that those files exist; that test will fail unless dist/ artifacts are present at test time.
- tests/smoke.test.ts imports '../src/index.js' (explicit .js extension) and asserts createPostCSSConfig exists; since tests import source, this will exercise source TS via Vitest TS support; however tests that check compiled dist files require build beforehand.
- Many implementation files referenced in docs/prompts (helpers.ts, postcss.ts, etc.) appear to be implemented per history; if present, their code looks reasonable (autoprefixer usage, ESM import extensions, defensive plugin loading in vite.config.ts).
- Potential type-only import references to '@voder/shared' in helper code could cause tsc unresolved-type errors if types not available; history indicated tsc passed earlier, so likely not an actual failure in current state.
- tsconfig includes "prettier.config.ts" which does not appear in repo — harmless but slightly noisy.
- package.json has peerDependencies and devDependencies overlapping (autoprefixer, postcss, vitest, etc.) — acceptable for config packages but should be intentional.
- Minor coding style issues: some uses of any, loose typing in vite.config.ts; that's pragmatic and acceptable for config-level code.
- Main reliability problem visible: tests that validate dist/ files will fail if build not executed before tests. The repository's scripts do not enforce pretest build (no pretest script), so test runs are brittle unless caller runs build first. This is a procedural/test orchestration issue rather than implementation logic bug but it affects correctness of the verification pipeline.
- No obvious runtime logic bugs in createPostCSSConfig or vite.config.ts; code defensively handles absent optional plugin and constructs PostCSS config sensibly.

Conclusions for code quality scoring:
- Core implementation appears correct and idiomatic for a config/tools package.
- Biggest issue is test orchestration: tests assume compiled artifacts exist (package-structure.test.ts) but package scripts don't guarantee build-before-test; this will cause false negatives in CI if pipeline order not enforced.
- A couple of small cleanliness items (unused include in tsconfig, any usage, overlapping deps) lower polish but not correctness.

Score around mid-to-high: code appears sound but testing orchestration and minor polish issues reduce from near-perfect.
</scratchpad>

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (75% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The core implementation looks correct and purposeful: the PostCSS config factory and defensive Vite plugin loader follow expected patterns, imports use explicit .js extensions for ESM, and TypeScript configuration (NodeNext + outDir) aligns with package.json exports.
- No blatant logic bugs are apparent in the provided source (postcss factory, vite config, and export barrel are sensible). Defensive coding (try/catch around optional imports, mocked browser APIs in test setup) is appropriate.
- Main functional shortcoming is test orchestration: tests that validate package.json → dist/ artifact mappings (tests/package-structure.test.ts) require compiled output to exist, but package.json does not enforce a pretest build step. This makes the test suite brittle unless callers run build before test. This is a procedural/test-run issue that will cause verification failures (false negatives) rather than a bug in the library code itself.
- Minor issues reducing polish and maintainability:
  - tsconfig.json includes "prettier.config.ts" which is not present — noisy but not harmful.
  - Some uses of any and loose typing (vite.config.ts) lower type-safety in non-critical areas.
  - The repository declares overlapping peerDependencies/devDependencies for the same tools (intentional pattern for config packages but worth documenting), which can be confusing if unintentional.
  - Tests that assert file existence use simple string replacement for './' prefix; robust path normalization would be slightly safer across environments.
- Overall, code is solid for a configuration/tooling package, but test orchestration and a few small cleanliness items keep the score from being higher. Addressing the build-before-test orchestration and a couple of polish items would raise the code-quality score substantially.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (15% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Current test surface: There are two formal Vitest suites present:
  - tests/smoke.test.ts — a smoke test that imports the package entry and asserts that createPostCSSConfig is exported.
  - tests/package-structure.test.ts — a package-structure validation that asserts package.json export paths point into ./dist/ and that those files exist.
- Test results status: The test suite is not currently green. The package-structure test will fail because the repository does not contain compiled artifacts under dist/ (exports point to ./dist/src/index.js, but no compiled files exist in the repo). That causes an immediate failure of the verification pipeline. Depending on Vitest resolution settings, the smoke test may pass when importing the TypeScript source, but the package-structure test makes the overall test run fail.
- Coverage adequacy: Coverage is effectively non‑existent for the product API surface. The two tests exercise only basic smoke and manifest verification; they do not cover:
  - Build configuration generation (vite/postcss)
  - DOM testing helpers, accessibility utilities, or test environment setup
  - Linting configuration generation
  - Export-equivalence, package-installation integration, error scenarios, edge cases
  - Any public API behavioral tests
  The universal requirements (minimum 90% coverage, 100% public API coverage) are far from being met.
- Quality of tests: The existing tests are correctly structured as Vitest suites and follow the project's conventions (formal Vitest tests rather than ad-hoc checks). The package-structure test is a useful CI guard, but it currently couples tests to a build artifact that isn't produced in-tree; that makes the test a gating failure until the build step (or test expectations) are aligned with the verification pipeline.
- Next actionable observations (testing-focused):
  - The test-run failure is single‑issue dominated: package-structure.test expects dist/ files that are not present. This is the highest‑priority test issue to address before broader test expansion.
  - Once the dist/ artifact requirement is satisfied (produce dist via build during verification, or change the test to validate source-to-dist build as part of a pretest step), tests can be run reliably and then expanded.
  - Substantial additional tests need to be implemented to meet project coverage goals (implement unit tests for each module, export-equivalence tests, integration/package-installation tests, and many error/edge-case tests).
- Summary assessment: Basic test scaffolding exists and follows project norms, but the suite is small and currently failing due to missing compiled artifacts. Test coverage is very low and far below the mandated thresholds. Estimated completion toward the testing goals: ~15% (±10%).

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (60% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The project has substantial execution progress: TypeScript config, build scripts (tsc), and Vitest-based tests exist and have run successfully at earlier points. DevDeps (vitest, typescript, postcss, autoprefixer, testing libs) were installed and earlier verification runs completed through type-check, build, and tests in prior iterations.
- However, the most recent canonical verification (type-check → build → test) failed (exit code 2). The last recorded failure was a Vitest/TypeScript ESM import-extension error (TS2835) in tests/smoke.test.ts; that import was patched to use an explicit .js extension and committed. There is no evidence a full verification run has been completed and succeeded since that patch.
- Additional likely friction remains: package-structure.test expects compiled files under dist/ (package.json exports point to ./dist/src/index.js). If dist/ is not produced before running those tests, package-structure tests will fail. Earlier runs produced builds and fixes, but current repo state shows no fresh successful end-to-end verification.
- Conclusion: the build + test tooling is mostly wired and has worked previously, but the project is not yet currently verified end‑to‑end — one or two remaining issues block a clean canonical verification. Run the canonical verification (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) to confirm the current state; until that succeeds, execution cannot be considered fully validated.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (60% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository includes strong internal documentation for design and governance: comprehensive ADRs (docs/decisions), a detailed package implementation guide (prompts/development-ui-tools.md), and a broad "Universal Development Guide" that codifies policies, testing rules, and required workflows. There are also helpful library usage guides (docs/libraries/usage/*.md) and inline usage snippets in the implementation guide and prompts. These materials provide excellent context for maintainers and LLM-driven development: intent, constraints, test requirements, and architectural rules are well captured.

- Major gaps that keep overall documentation from being "complete" for package consumers and contributors:
  - No package README.md in the repository root or package root. The Universal Guide explicitly requires a self-contained README for public-facing consumption (installation, quick start, license, security posture, scripts). That file is missing.
  - No CHANGELOG.md (there is a CHANGELOG template referenced, but no actual changelog present).
  - No formal API reference or generated documentation for public exports (beyond examples embedded in prompts and guide text). Consumers lack a single-source API reference (types, function signatures, return values, examples).
  - Missing developer-facing README/DEVELOPMENT.md that documents local setup and the canonical verification pipeline (type-check → build → test) in one place — although the Universal Guide documents the workflow broadly, a package-level, actionable README is absent.
  - The repo relies on many "prompts" documents and ADRs for API/usage examples rather than a dedicated, discoverable docs/ or README-based API section. That makes onboarding/copying examples less convenient for external consumers.
  - No documented script surface (scripts.json or README scripts section) describing expected commands and their semantics (prepare, verify, lint:md, etc.) beyond package.json content.
  - No explicit, packaged .markdownlint.json generation instructions (the guide references it, but there is no package-level script or example file checked in).

- Recommended immediate, high-value next steps (small, atomic changes):
  1. Add a self-contained README.md (root/package) using the provided README-template: include Purpose, Installation, Quick Start examples (using the exported factory functions), Scripts (how to run type-check/build/test/verify), License (UNLICENSED), and Security posture. This closes the largest consumer-facing gap.
  2. Add a minimal CHANGELOG.md (stub) referencing the template.
  3. Add a short DEVELOPMENT.md with the canonical verification steps (type-check → build → test), local setup, and how to run the package tests; call out Node engine requirement for TypeScript configs where relevant.
  4. Add a concise API reference (docs/api.md) listing public exports (createPostCSSConfig etc.) with signatures and examples — even a hand-maintained file is valuable until automated docs are added.
  5. Add a small note/instruction for generating .markdownlint.json (or commit a generated sample for local development) and include lint:md scripts in README usage examples.

- Conclusion: The project is well-documented at the architectural and governance level (excellent ADRs and guides), but it lacks the essential, consumer- and contributor-facing artifacts (README, changelog, API reference, and short developer guide). Filling those gaps will move the documentation from "internal-complete" to "consumer- and contributor-ready."

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (90% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall: Dependencies look current and intentionally chosen; devDependencies and peerDependencies are largely aligned with the package’s ADRs (Vitest + V8 coverage provider present and version-aligned), and an earlier non-interactive npm audit reported zero vulnerabilities for the installed tree.
- Freshness: Most packages are recent (vitest 3.2.4, @vitest/coverage-v8 3.2.4, typescript 5.x, jsdom 26.x, autoprefixer/postcss 8–10 range). These are plausible current versions for a modern UI tooling package.
- Security: The project ran an npm audit earlier that reported zero vulnerabilities. That is a good indicator; however, supply‑chain state can change—re-run npm audit regularly and before release to catch newly discovered advisories.
- Compatibility / policy conformance:
  - Good: vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 are present and version-aligned (3.2.x), which matches the ADR that requires alignment for the V8 provider.
  - Minor concern: peerDependencies list jest-axe as ^9.0.0 while devDependencies include jest-axe ^10.0.0. That mismatch could surface confusing peer warnings for consumers (they may be told to install v9 while the package was developed/tested with v10). Align peer/dev versions or justify the divergence in an ADR.
  - PeerDeps include vite ^6.0.0 but vite is not present in devDependencies; if local dev/test workflows rely on vite, consider adding it as a devDependency or confirm that consumers provide it (this is acceptable for a config/helper package but should be intentional).
  - @voder/dev-config is referenced as a file: workspace dependency (file:../dev-config). This is OK for local development but note it will need proper packaging for consumers.
- Versioning policy risk: Some entries use caret ranges (e.g., ^3.2.4) which allows minor/patch updates; ADRs mention exact alignment for vitest coverage provider in certain cases — consider pinning to exact versions or documenting the alignment policy for packages that must match precisely.
- Actionable recommendations (minimal):
  1. Re-run npm audit (npm audit --json) to confirm there are still no vulnerabilities in the current environment.
  2. Align jest-axe between peerDependencies and devDependencies (choose ^10.x or change dev to ^9.x) and commit the change (or add an ADR explaining the intentional mismatch).
  3. If the package expects vite for local verification, either add vite to devDependencies or document that vite is only required as a consumer peer dependency.
  4. If ADRs require strict version alignment for vitest + provider, consider pinning those two to exact matching versions (or document the strategy in an ADR).
- Confidence: High for the stated snapshot (audit run earlier reported zero vulnerabilities and versions are coherent). Remaining work is primarily housekeeping and alignment rather than triaging known vulnerabilities.

<scratchpad>
Considered files: package.json, src/*.ts, tests/*.ts, vite.config.ts, tsconfig, scripts in package.json, .gitignore/.voderignore, ADRs and docs.

Key observations:
- No obvious runtime code that performs network I/O, spawns shells, evaluates remote code, or reads sensitive environment variables.
- build/postcss.ts uses autoprefixer (dependency). createPostCSSConfig is pure; safe.
- vite.config.ts does dynamic import('vite-plugin-inline-source'); catches and ignores errors — this attempts to load an optional plugin from node_modules only; if an attacker were to inject a malicious module into node_modules, dynamic import could execute it during dev-time. But this is typical and depends on dependency supply-chain security.
- Tests and testing setup mock browser APIs and use testing libs; tests do manipulate global objects but only in test environment.
- package.json contains "prepare": "node ../../setup-package-docs.js" which will execute code at npm install time (prepare hooks run on install). That can be risky if the setup script is not audited or if the repository is used by others. Likewise "voder" script points to a path outside package; potential for running external code.
- Many devDependencies and peerDependencies (vitest, jsdom, markdownlint-cli2, jest-axe, autoprefixer, postcss, etc.). Large dev dependency surface increases supply-chain risk. ADRs mention supply-chain audits and registry-mirror policy; good mitigation but needs enforcement.
- No secrets in repo files observed. .gitignore covers many outputs; .voder metadata tracked — could contain operational metadata; ensure it doesn't leak secrets.
- No use of eval, Function constructor, or dynamic code construction in source files reviewed.
- Some documentation/test examples show use of child_process.execSync and writing files to disk (pack+install in package-installation.test.ts example). Those examples are not present in actual tests directory, but if implemented, they should use safe temp directories and proper cleanup — docs already recommend mkdtemp and rm.
- TypeScript/ESM import extension warnings fixed; not a security issue.
- No input validation concerns since code is configuration factories and helpers; however any consumer-provided configuration merges should be sanitized when used to avoid prototype pollution (not present).
- Prettier config as TypeScript, and scripts using NODE_OPTIONS with experimental flag could be abused if attacker controls NODE_OPTIONS environment; but that is general risk.

Mitigations recommended:
- Enforce lockfile usage and pin critical tooling versions; regular npm audit and automated supply-chain scans (ADR references this).
- Review and audit any prepare scripts and other lifecycle scripts (setup-package-docs.js) before permitting installs; consider limiting what prepare does or require explicit opt-in for running it across environments.
- Apply least privilege: CI runs in isolated containers with no network access to unaudited registries where possible; use registry mirrors.
- Vet optional dynamic imports: ensure only trusted packages are allowed; consider whitelisting optional plugin names or guarding via config flags.
- Avoid running arbitrary code at package install or document/limit effects.
- Keep test helpers and setup isolated to test environment; ensure they don't write into repository (docs already stress temp dir usage).
- Monitor transitive dependencies, and use tools like Dependabot, Snyk, or internal supply-chain auditing.

Estimate completeness: cover obvious code-level risks, and higher-level supply-chain concerns.
</scratchpad>

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (70% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall posture: Reasonably safe for a development tooling package that contains configuration factories and test helpers. There is no evidence of deliberate insecure coding (no evals, no network I/O, no runtime credential handling) in the source files present (src/* and vite.config.ts). Tests and helpers operate in jsdom/test environment and do not persist data to the repository.

- Supply-chain risk (primary concern): The largest security exposure is dependency / supply-chain risk. The project declares many devDependencies and peerDependencies (vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, jsdom, postcss, autoprefixer, markdownlint-cli2, jest-axe, etc.). Dynamic imports (vite.config.ts) and optional plugin loading increase the attack surface by executing code from node_modules at dev-time. Mitigation: enforce lockfile, automated vulnerability scanning, registry mirrors, and ADR-mandated supply-chain audits (already referenced in docs). Without active enforcement, transitive dependency vulnerabilities or malicious packages could be introduced.

- Lifecycle script risk: package.json "prepare": "node ../../setup-package-docs.js" will execute arbitrary JS during installs (prepare hook). Any executable lifecycle script is an execution point for unauthorized code if the script or its dependencies are compromised. Mitigation: audit and minimize prepare script behavior; ensure it is deterministic and safe; document it and restrict by policy.

- Installer/runtime environment risk: Scripts that depend on NODE_OPTIONS or experimental flags (per ADRs) may be influenced by environment variables. Avoid relying on untrusted NODE_OPTIONS and document required flags. CI should control environment to avoid injection.

- Test & temp-file safety: Test examples and docs instruct creation of temp directories and use of execSync. These patterns are safe when used with mkdtemp and proper cleanup (docs already recommend this). Ensure actual test code uses temp dirs (tmpdir) and never writes into repo workspace.

- Privilege & data exposure: No secret keys, credentials, or network calls in current code. .voder metadata files are tracked — review their content for sensitive data. Ensure no secrets are accidentally committed to .voder files.

- Input sanitization / prototype pollution: The code provides configuration merge helpers in docs; if the package later accepts arbitrary consumer-provided configs and merges them into objects that may be used at runtime, consider guarding against prototype pollution (Object.create(null) for option maps or deep-merge libraries that avoid prototype pollution).

- Recommendations (actionable)
  1. Enforce lockfile and pin critical build/test tooling; run automated audits on dependency updates.
  2. Audit and harden the prepare script (../../setup-package-docs.js) before allowing installs in untrusted environments.
  3. Limit dynamic plugin loading scope and/or whitelist optional plugin names to reduce execution of arbitrary modules.
  4. Run regular dependency/supply-chain checks (npm audit, SCA tooling) and integrate into CI (ADR already prescribes audits and mirrors).
  5. Ensure tests and any packaging scripts only write to OS temp directories and never to repo workspace; add checks to CI where appropriate.
  6. Inspect .voder metadata for sensitive info and avoid tracking secrets.

- Confidence & coverage: This assessment reviews the repository files provided and project-level policies. It focuses on code-level and process-level security issues visible in the tree; it does not include a full dependency vulnerability scan (no live npm audit run here). Given that limitation, estimate is 70% ±10% complete — it covers obvious code patterns and governance risks but not deep transitive dependency auditing or CI runtime configuration.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (30% ±5% COMPLETE)
- The repository is partially managed but not in a clean, publishable state: your branch is synchronized with origin (no unpushed commits), however there are both staged and unstaged modifications in the working tree so NOT all changes are committed. Because any uncommitted changes exist the repository cannot be considered fully managed under the required rules.
- Specifics:
  - Uncommitted changes: Several .voder metadata files are staged (7 files) and additional .voder files are modified but unstaged (3 files: .voder/history.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md). This violates the “ALL CHANGES COMMITTED” requirement.
  - Unpushed commits: None — git reports “Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'”, so no pending pushes.
  - File tracking / ignores: No untracked important files were reported; .gitignore correctly covers build artifacts (dist/, coverage/, node_modules, etc.) and .voderignore exposes dist/ for LLM inspection. File-tracking ratios look reasonable.
  - Clean working state: Not satisfied — staged + unstaged modifications mean the working tree is not clean or publishable.

Summary judgment: because of the presence of staged and unstaged changes (even though commits are pushed and ignores are correct), the version control state is limited to ~30% completeness. To reach a >80% score you must commit or discard the outstanding changes so the working tree is clean and then verify pushes.
