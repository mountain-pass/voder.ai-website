![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

<scratchpad>
- Need to include short reasoning notes per developer instruction.
- Must present overall status header exactly as required.
- Emphasize VERSION_CONTROL (30%) and TESTING (45%) as highest priority next steps.
- Provide concise actionable next steps in correct order, referencing verify loop.
- Keep tone decisive and minimal.
</scratchpad>

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (67% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What is complete
  - Core build helpers implemented and tested: createPostCSSConfig (Autoprefixer) and createViteLibraryConfig (ESM-only library factory) are implemented and have unit tests. (FUNCTIONALITY ~65%)
  - Jsdom test environment and DOM testing helpers (renderComponent, simulateClick, simulateKeypress, waitForNextFrame, waitForAnimation) are implemented with unit tests. (CODE_QUALITY ~78%)
  - Project metadata, TypeScript config, README, and ADRs exist and document intended architecture and policies. (DOCUMENTATION ~75%)
  - Dependencies are modern and aligned with ADR guidance (Vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8 aligned). Prior audit ran with no reported vulnerabilities. (DEPENDENCIES ~85%; SECURITY ~85%)
  - Build artifacts exist in dist/ from previous successful builds; build/test scripts are wired. (EXECUTION ~70%)

- What is missing or blocking
  - Tests are currently blocked by TypeScript import-extension issues and a recent uncommitted change:
    - Several test files import source with a trailing “.ts” extension (TS5097) which prevents type-check/build/test runs. (TESTING assessed at ~45%)
    - There is one unstaged change (.gitignore) in the working tree; repository is not in a fully clean, committed state. (VERSION_CONTROL ~30%)
  - Functional gaps vs. the implementation guide:
    - Accessibility testing utilities (jest-axe helpers) and linting config factories (HTML/CSS/accessibility) are described but not implemented.
    - The package does not yet expose the full public API surface (dedicated subpath exports like "./testing", "./linting") or the mandatory scripts (lint, lint:fix, format, lint:md, verify).
    - Required integration tests mandated by policy (export-equivalence, package-installation) are not present.
  - Some code-quality items to address:
    - renderComponent currently swallows errors silently; console-first policy suggests logging to stderr.
    - Use of any casts around PostCSS merging weakens type safety.
  - Because of the above, a full verify (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) does not currently complete green.

- Reference to sub-assessments
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 65% — core features present but many guide-required features missing.
  - CODE_QUALITY: 78% — well-structured code; small issues to harden.
  - TESTING: 45% — tests exist and target the right areas but are blocked and coverage is insufficient vs policy.
  - EXECUTION: 70% — build and tools mostly work; recent TypeScript/test errors block full verification.
  - DOCUMENTATION: 75% — strong governance and usage docs; missing concise API reference and a few automation artifacts.
  - DEPENDENCIES: 85% — modern and aligned; re-run audit recommended.
  - SECURITY: 85% — no code-level vuln; supply-chain is primary risk and ADRs exist.
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 30% — working tree not fully clean (unstaged .gitignore modification).

## NEXT PRIORITY
Highest priority immediate work (single-file/small commits, follow the one-change-per-commit verify loop):

1. Clean working tree (VERSION_CONTROL)
   - Action: Commit or revert the modified .gitignore so the repository is clean.
   - Why: A clean working tree is required for reliable verification and publishing; current uncommitted change reduces VC score to 30%.
   - Example:
     - git add .gitignore
     - git commit -m "chore: persist intended .gitignore change" (or git restore .gitignore if accidental)
     - git push origin main

2. Fix TypeScript test import errors (TESTING)
   - Action: Remove `.ts` extensions from test imports so they use runtime-resolvable paths (e.g., change '../../src/testing/helpers.ts' → '../../src/testing/helpers').
   - Why: TS5097 import-extension errors block type-check/build. Fixing these will allow verify (type-check/build/test) to run and surface remaining runtime failures.
   - Follow the project's incremental policy: edit only tests/testing/helpers.test.ts first (as planned), commit, push, then run verification.
   - After committing that change, immediately run:
     - npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test
   - If the verification run surfaces a second test file with `.ts` imports (e.g., setup.test.ts), apply the same single-file fix and repeat.

3. Re-run verify loop and fix any test failures iteratively
   - Action: After the import fixes, run the full verify sequence and address failures one file at a time following the established plan:
     - If renderComponent lifecycle tests fail, apply the targeted helper update (track ownership of created container and emit console.error on mount/unmount failures).
     - If other failures appear, fix one file per commit and re-run verify.
   - Why: This will move TESTING and EXECUTION to green and expose functional gaps.

4. Medium-term priorities (after verification is green)
   - Implement missing guided features incrementally:
     - src/testing/accessibility.ts (jest-axe helpers) and tests.
     - src/linting/* factories and tests for HTML/CSS/accessibility.
     - Add full package.json scripts (lint, format, lint:md, verify) and ensure .markdownlint.json generation is implemented (or documented).
     - Add package exports for dedicated subpaths if intended, and the required export-equivalence and package-installation integration tests.
   - Rationale: These address FUNCTIONALITY gaps and the repository policy requirements for dual exports, markdown linting, and coverage.

5. Security & dependencies housekeeping
   - Re-run npm audit and supply-chain scans in CI locally.
   - Resolve any version mismatches (e.g., jest-axe peer/dev divergence) and document dependency decisions in ADRs when necessary.

Summary of immediate actionable next step:
- Commit or revert .gitignore to clean the working tree, then remove `.ts` extensions from test imports (one file → commit → push → verify). This will unblock the verification pipeline and provide deterministic next failures to fix in single-file iterations.

If you want, I can: (A) make the single-file edit to tests/testing/helpers.test.ts to remove the .ts extension, add a commit message, and prepare the next verify step; or (B) produce the exact sequence of commands to run locally for the immediate steps above. Which would you like me to do next?



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (65% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Implemented core features
  - PostCSS configuration factory (createPostCSSConfig) implemented with Autoprefixer defaults and overridable plugins — unit tests present.
  - Vite library configuration factory (createViteLibraryConfig) implemented: ESM-only build options, external handling, PostCSS merge, cssCodeSplit option — unit tests present.
  - Basic jsdom test environment setup (setupJsdomTestEnvironment) implemented and tested.
  - DOM testing helpers implemented (renderComponent, simulateClick, simulateKeypress, waitForNextFrame, waitForAnimation) with unit tests covering lifecycle and interaction semantics.
  - Package metadata, tsconfig, README, and several ADRs and documentation files exist and reflect design decisions.
  - Build outputs (dist/) and compiled artifacts are present and package.json exports point to the dist entry — package-structure and smoke tests target those artifacts.
  - Test infrastructure (Vitest) and scripts for build/type-check/test exist and are wired (type-check, build, test, test:ci).

- Partially implemented / working but not complete
  - Tests: there are unit and smoke tests for the implemented pieces (postcss, vite-library, helpers, setup, package-structure). This gives good coverage of current code, but universal requirements expect many more categories (export-equivalence, package-installation integration, installation/exports for multiple subpaths). Those are not present.
  - The package-level public API barrel (src/index.ts) currently only exports the build helpers (PostCSS & Vite). The testing helpers and test-environment are implemented in src/ but not re-exported through the main public barrel as recommended by the UI-tools guide. Consumers would need to import testing utilities via internal paths rather than the package root API.
  - Dist contains compiled JS for only a subset of the guided exports; the wider export structure recommended in the guide (dedicated subpath exports like "./testing", "./linting", "./accessibility") is not implemented in package.json exports or in dist.
  - Documentation and templates are present in prose (prompts/docs) but the package does not include the example templates (templates/ files referenced in the guide are not in src/templates).

- Missing required features per the guide/spec
  - Accessibility testing utilities (expectAccessible, getAccessibilityViolations, expectAriaAttributes, expectFocusable, accessibilityTests using jest-axe) are described in the guide but are not implemented in src/testing/accessibility.ts.
  - Linting configuration factories (HTML/CSS/accessibility lint config creators) described in the guide are not present in src/linting/.
  - Mandatory package scripts from the Universal Guide (lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix, verify, lint:md scripts with generated .markdownlint.json) are missing. The prepare/voder scripts exist but the suite of quality scripts required by the policy is incomplete.
  - Package dual-export strategy and the corresponding tests (export-equivalence tests, package-installation integration tests) required for configuration packages are not implemented.
  - Coverage and testing policy: the universal guide requires high coverage thresholds and many categories of tests (90% thresholds and 100% public API coverage). Current tests exercise key functions but do not meet those comprehensive coverage requirements.
  - ESLint / Prettier integration files and package-local eslint.config.js / prettier.config.js are not present as mandated by the repo-wide style rules.

- Risk / Practical consequences
  - Consumers who expect the full set of ui-tools features (testing utilities available from package root, accessibility helpers, linting factories) will not find those APIs via the public package exports; integration and convenience are limited.
  - Policy-driven CI/verify expectations (verify script, markdown linting setup, export-equivalence tests) are not met, so the package would fail the repository's mandatory verification workflow without additional commits.
  - Missing accessibility and linting modules reduce the package's value for the intended target (component-library teams expecting an integrated UI tooling surface).

- Conclusion
  - The repository contains a solid, working core: PostCSS factory, Vite factory, jsdom setup, and DOM testing helpers with tests — these are correct and exercised by unit tests. That covers a large portion of the "library build configuration" and "basic testing helpers" responsibilities.
  - However, substantial guided requirements remain unimplemented: accessibility helpers, linting factories, standardized scripts, public exports for testing utilities, and the full set of mandatory tests and exports. Until those are added and the verify pipeline scripts are completed, the package does not meet the full functional requirements of the provided implementation guides and policies.

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (78% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall the code is well organized, modular, and follows the stated architecture: small focused files, clear public API surface, ESM-first patterns, and comprehensive test coverage goals. The implementation uses safe patterns (guarded dynamic imports for optional plugins, PostCSS/Vite factories, isolated jsdom setup, and dedicated testing helpers). Comments and types improve readability and intent.
- Tests and tooling are present and realistic (Vitest, jsdom mocks, accessibility helpers planned). The repo includes package metadata and scripts aligned with the project conventions.
- Issues / bugs that prevent a clean verification:
  - TypeScript import extension errors in tests: several test files import source modules using explicit “.ts” extensions (e.g., tests/testing/helpers.test.ts → import '../../src/testing/helpers.ts'). The tsconfig does not enable allowImportingTsExtensions, so these imports cause TS5097 errors and block type-check/build. Some other imports use “.js” extensions intentionally for runtime ESM resolution (this is acceptable under NodeNext), but the .ts-extension imports in tests are incorrect.
  - Silent error swallowing in renderComponent: mount/unmount are wrapped in try/catch without any console logging. That hides failures and violates the console-first diagnostic guidance — making debugging harder and tests less informative. The unmount try/finally hides errors as well.
  - Minor test fragility / cleanup: setup.ts manually removes document.body children (ok) but differs from testing-library cleanup semantics; tests assume specific lifecycle semantics (ownership of appended container). Current helpers mostly satisfy tests, but behavioral edge cases exist (ownership tracking).
  - Use of any casts and runtime type casts in places (to satisfy tsc) reduce type-safety in the test/merge code paths (e.g., mergedPostcss: Record<string, unknown>, many (any) casts). These are pragmatic but reduce the strictness guarantees.
- Style / standards observations:
  - Good: files are small, responsibilities are separated, naming is consistent, and comments/docstrings provide intent. The tests exercise key behaviors.
  - Improvement areas: prefer emitting diagnostics (console.error) when catching exceptions in test helpers, reduce unnecessary any casts by improving types, and ensure test imports follow NodeNext/tsconfig rules (use .js runtime extensions or enable allowImportingTsExtensions if intentional).
- Risk summary:
  - The single most pressing blocker is the .ts-extension imports in test files which cause type-check/build failures. Fixing those imports (remove the .ts extension) will unblock verification runs.
  - Less severe but important: replace silent swallow-catches with logged errors to preserve console-first debugging and make test failures visible in history.
- Actionable recommendations (minimal, targeted):
  1. Update test imports that end in ‘.ts’ to omit the extension (e.g., '../../src/testing/helpers' and '../../src/testing/setup') — this is a single-file-per-change small edit pattern.
  2. Adjust renderComponent to log mount/unmount errors to stderr (console.error) and track whether the helper created the container before removing it.
  3. Replace a few any casts with precise types where practical (especially around postcss merging) to improve type safety.
- Final assessment: the codebase is structurally sound and largely correct, but a few focused changes (test import extensions and improving error diagnostics) are required to reach a clean, reliable verification state and to satisfy the project's console-first and type-safety expectations.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (45% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- There is a sensible set of Vitest suites covering the package's key responsibilities: PostCSS config, Vite library config, public export shape (package-structure), smoke tests for the main export, and DOM/testing helpers + setup. This gives good surface-area coverage for core factory helpers and test utilities.
- However, tests are currently not reliably runnable because of TypeScript import-extension issues: several test files import source modules using a trailing ".ts" extension (e.g., tests/testing/helpers.test.ts and tests/testing/setup.test.ts), and the tsconfig does not enable allowImportingTsExtensions. This causes TS5097 errors during type-check/build and prevents the test run from executing.
- The test suite also previously reported a TS2305 error (named import cleanup from @testing-library/dom) which was fixed by replacing cleanup() with explicit DOM teardown in src/testing/setup.ts — that file now passes its basic "does not throw" test.
- Functional test coverage is incomplete:
  - Accessibility helpers (jest-axe integration) are not implemented/tested.
  - Integration/package-installation tests and export-equivalence tests required by the policy are not present.
  - Error-paths and deeper API surface tests (edge cases, thrown errors) are minimal or absent.
- Because of the type-check / import issues the verification loop currently fails at the TypeScript step; until that is fixed tests do not run and coverage cannot be measured.
- Overall assessment:
  - Test presence and focus: good (targets the right modules).
  - Test pass status: currently failing due to TypeScript import-extension issues (blocking).
  - Coverage adequacy vs. project policy: insufficient — the repository requires high coverage thresholds (90%+), but current test suites are small and do not approach that target.

Summary recommendation (brief):
- Fix imports in test files to remove '.ts' extensions (or enable allowImportingTsExtensions if intentional). After that, run the verify sequence to surface any remaining runtime test failures.
- Implement/add the missing integration and accessibility tests to reach the policy-mandated coverage goals.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (70% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The project has made substantial progress and the build/test toolchain is mostly functional: TypeScript compilation (tsc) has produced dist/ outputs and there are compiled artifacts under dist/, and Vitest test suites have passed in earlier verification runs. The package.json contains working scripts for type-check, build, and test, and many tests and build helpers are implemented.
- However, the most recent full verification (npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test) failed due to TypeScript errors in test imports (notably: TS2305 from an invalid named import cleanup from @testing-library/dom and TS5097 for imports that include a .ts extension). One of those issues (the cleanup import) was fixed and committed, but the verification loop has not completed cleanly since — there remain test-import path issues that are being iteratively addressed.
- Conclusion: The core build pipeline works in large part (dist exists, build steps have worked previously), but the current repository state is not fully validated end-to-end because outstanding TypeScript/test import errors are preventing a successful, repeatable verify run.

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (75% ±10% COMPLETE)
- The repository contains strong, well‑structured documentation for process, governance and high‑level usage: a clear README with quick start, examples (vite/vitest/postcss), security posture, and verification steps; extensive ADRs in docs/decisions that record rationale and constraints; a usage doc for related dev-config and a PostCSS library note. Inline code comments and the implementation guides (prompts/*.md) further explain intended APIs, patterns, and test requirements. However, the package lacks a concise, complete API reference for @voder/ui-tools (no generated API docs or a dedicated reference page that lists signatures, options, and return shapes for createPostCSSConfig, createViteLibraryConfig, and the testing helpers), limited examples for testing utilities and linting factories, and no CHANGELOG or explicit markdownlint generation artifact (.markdownlint.json is only described, not present). There is also a mismatch between recommended dual‑export patterns in the universal guide and the package exports (documentation expects dedicated subpath exports for testing/linting/etc.), which should be documented or reconciled. Recommended next documentation work (small, prioritized): add a short API reference (function signatures + option descriptions + example snippets) for build and testing utilities; document testing helper usage and lifecycle expectations; add a CHANGELOG placeholder and a note or script to generate .markdownlint.json; and update README to call out exact subpath exports supported (or document why they’re intentionally omitted). Overall the docs are thorough on governance and usage intent but missing targeted API reference and a few packaging / docs automation artifacts.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (85% ±10% COMPLETE)
- Freshness
  - Overall the package uses modern toolchain versions: TypeScript 5.9.x, Vitest 3.2.x, @vitest/coverage-v8 3.2.4, jsdom 26.x and @types/node 24.x. These are current major/minor lines consistent with the project’s Node >= 22.6.0 guidance.
  - PostCSS / Autoprefixer are on PostCSS 8 / Autoprefixer 10.x lines — still widely used and compatible with Vite; autoprefixer is pinned at 10.4.21 (dev), which is up-to-date within the 10.x line.
  - markdownlint-cli2, @testing-library packages, jest-axe, and other dev tools are on reasonable, recent versions for development tooling.

- Security (vulnerabilities)
  - The project history indicates an npm audit was run previously across the dependency graph and reported zero vulnerabilities. That strongly suggests there were no immediate known high/critical findings at the last scan.
  - I cannot run a live audit here. Recommendation: re-run `npm audit` (and any org SCA tooling) in CI or locally to confirm no new vulnerabilities have appeared since the last scan.

- Compatibility / Policy alignment
  - Vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 versions are aligned (3.2.x), matching the ADR that requires version alignment for the V8 provider — this is correct and avoids peer-compatibility problems for coverage.
  - TypeScript and @types/node versions match the NodeNext/ES2022 target and the project’s Node version guidance.
  - The package correctly puts several runtime build tools into peerDependencies (vite, postcss, autoprefixer, vitest) which is appropriate for a config/tooling package.
  - One notable mismatch to review: jest-axe appears in peerDependencies as "^9.0.0" but the devDependency is "^10.0.0". That divergence can cause confusion for consumers (peer warns about v9 while local dev uses v10). Align the peer range with the tested/dev version or document/justify the mismatch in an ADR.
  - Another policy note (not a security issue but worth verifying): markdownlint-cli2 is present as a devDependency. The Universal Guide suggests markdownlint-cli2 may be a peer for dev-config packages — ensure this placement is correct for this package's intended consumer model.

- Version ranges & update strategy
  - The package mostly uses caret (^) ranges for devDependencies and peerDependencies, which allows minor/patch updates while avoiding major bumps. This is fine for dev tooling but keep an eye on major releases (e.g., Vitest 4.x) that may require ADR/test work.
  - ADRs in the repo explicitly require exact alignment for vitest/provider — that policy is respected here.

- Risks & recommended actions
  - Re-run `npm audit` and any org supply-chain scanners now to confirm there are still no vulnerabilities.
  - Align the jest-axe peer/dev versions (either set peer=>^10 or change dev=>^9) to avoid consumer confusion and potential mismatch warnings.
  - Periodically sweep major dev-tool upgrades (Vitest, jsdom, TypeScript, PostCSS) and run the verify pipeline; create ADRs for any dependency changes that affect consumers or require version alignment.
  - Consider automating dependency updates (Dependabot/renovate) and SCA in CI to surface issues promptly.

Summary: dependencies appear current and consistent with the package's Node/TS targets; prior audit reported zero vulnerabilities. The main actionable item is to resolve the jest-axe version mismatch and to re-run an up-to-date vulnerability scan to confirm no new issues.

<scratchpad>
- Review code and tests for runtime exposures: src files mostly create config objects, DOM helpers, mocks. No network calls, no eval, no writing to repo files.
- Dynamic imports: vite.config.ts does dynamic import of optional plugin (vite-plugin-inline-source). If that plugin is installed, it executes plugin code at build time. That's expected behavior but is supply-chain risk.
- package.json prepare script runs node ../../setup-package-docs.js on npm install — could execute arbitrary JS at install time. Ensure script is reviewed and trusted.
- DevDependencies include many third-party tools (postcss, autoprefixer, jsdom, jest-axe, vitest, markdownlint-cli2). These are dev-time but still represent supply-chain risk for contributors/CI.
- Tests: some examples use execSync and child_process in documentation; not used in src tests. But if integration tests added that execSync npm pack and npm install, they will execute shell commands—need careful sanitization and isolation.
- createViteLibraryConfig uses resolve(entry) — path resolution is local; consumers pass entry so no arbitrary remote code. Merging postcss plugins allows arbitrary plugin functions; consumers must trust plugins they pass.
- setup test environment removed cleanup import; uses vi mocks — no vulnerabilities.
- Dist files are present in repository listing; if compiled artifacts are tracked they could differ from source; ensure dist not committed to avoid hidden malicious code in built files.
- No handling of untrusted HTML outside test environment; accessibility helpers running axe on DOM could execute JS if consumers pass untrusted markup — note caution.
- Recommendations: enforce lockfile, run npm audit regularly, pin/blocklist risky transitive deps, review prepare script, avoid executing shell commands with unsanitized inputs in tests, ensure dist is gitignored and not committed, use reproducible registries/mirrors, limit optional dynamic plugin execution or document trust requirements.
</scratchpad>

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall risk posture: Low-to-moderate. The package is a development tooling library (dev-time utilities, config factories, test helpers) and intentionally does not perform network I/O or persist data at runtime. There are no obvious high‑severity coding vulnerabilities (no eval, no direct filesystem writes to the repository, no deserialization of untrusted payloads). The primary security exposure is supply‑chain: third‑party devDependencies and any code executed during build/test/install time.

Key findings and potential vulnerabilities
- Supply‑chain risk (primary concern)
  - Many third‑party packages are referenced (postcss, autoprefixer, jsdom, vitest, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2, etc.). Even as devDependencies, these run in developer/CI environments and can execute arbitrary code during install/build/test.
  - There is an ADR and mention of supply‑chain audit and registry‑mirror policy, which is good, but ongoing vigilance is required (npm audit, lockfile verification, registry mirrors, provenance checks).
- Execution at package lifecycle hooks
  - package.json contains a "prepare" script (node ../../setup-package-docs.js). Scripts run during npm install can execute arbitrary JS. Ensure the referenced script is reviewed, trusted, and does not process untrusted inputs.
- Dynamic plugin execution
  - vite.config.ts dynamically imports an optional plugin if installed. If a compromised plugin is present, it will execute at build time. This is expected but should be documented as a trust boundary.
- Test/integration commands that run shell processes
  - While the repo’s tests currently avoid unsafe shell usage, some example/integration patterns (npm pack + execSync in documentation) demonstrate running shell commands. If integration tests are added that execute shell commands in CI, they must ensure paths and command inputs are not influenced by untrusted data.
- Tracked build artifacts / dist visibility
  - Dist output is intended to be gitignored; tracked compiled artifacts in the repository can be a security concern (build vs source mismatch). Ensure compiled artifacts are not committed or are reviewed as part of release process. The repository currently shows dist/ files in the project root listing — confirm they are not tracked in git (and if they are, remove them).
- API surface that accepts executable plugins
  - createPostCSSConfig and createViteLibraryConfig accept plugin arrays/overrides. Those plugin objects/functions will be executed by PostCSS/Vite in consumers’ build environments. Consumers must only supply trusted plugins.
- Running accessibility checks on untrusted HTML
  - Accessibility helpers run jest-axe on DOM nodes. If consumers feed untrusted HTML into these helpers in production contexts (not just tests), there could be risks (e.g., scripts within HTML in non‑jsdom environments). Document that helpers are intended for test environments and should not be used on untrusted content without sanitization.

Recommendations / best practices
- Strengthen supply‑chain controls
  - Maintain and commit a lockfile (package-lock.json) and ensure CI uses npm ci.
  - Run regular npm audit and incorporate supply‑chain scanning (SCA) in CI.
  - Use registry mirrors and lockfile signing / integrity checks where possible.
  - Consider pinning critical packages or adding automatic alerts for dependency changes.
- Treat lifecycle scripts as high‑risk
  - Audit the prepare script and any other lifecycle scripts; avoid executing unreviewed code in install hooks. Document and restrict their behavior.
- Limit dynamic execution and document trust boundaries
  - Clearly document that optional plugins and passed-in PostCSS plugins are executed and must be trusted. Consider adding warnings in the README and inline JSDoc.
- Avoid committing compiled artifacts
  - Ensure dist/* is properly ignored and not tracked. If dist must appear for LLM inspection, keep it excluded from releases and verify content during packaging.
- Secure test/shell execution
  - When adding integration tests that call child_process.execSync or run shell commands, run them in an isolated temporary directory and avoid interpolating user-controlled strings into commands.
- Harden CI and developer environments
  - Enforce use of Node >= required version and apply process isolation for test runs (containerized CI runners).
  - Use least‑privilege runners and ephemeral workspaces for packaging steps that run third‑party code.

Summary
- No immediate code-level vulnerabilities (e.g., injection/eval) were found in src files. The dominant risk is supply‑chain (devDependencies and any lifecycle scripts or optional plugins that run during build/test). With established ADRs about auditing and registry mirrors, the project is aware of these risks; follow the recommendations above (lockfiles, audits, script review, not committing dist) to reduce residual risk.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (30% ± 10% COMPLETE)

- The repository is partially well-managed but not fully clean or synchronized for a publishable state. There is one unstaged/uncommitted change (modified .gitignore), so not all changes are committed. Because any uncommitted change reduces completeness heavily, this limits the score to the lower band.
- Specific status observations:
  - Uncommitted changes: Yes — git status shows a modified file: .gitignore (Changes not staged for commit). This alone forces the assessment into the low-complete range.
  - Unpushed commits: None — branch is up to date with origin/main (no "ahead" commits).
  - File tracking: Reasonable — tracked files counts are present and there are no untracked important files reported. Common build outputs (dist/, node_modules/, etc.) are listed in .gitignore and also appear in the "Git-ignored files" list, which is correct. The .voder metadata has been appropriately handled (excluded from the VC assessment).
  - Clean working state: Not clean — the working tree has a modified file that needs to be staged/committed (and pushed if the commit is new). That prevents the repo from being considered publishable in this moment.
- Recommendation (concise): Commit the .gitignore modification (or restore it if the modification was accidental) and re-run verification. After the working tree is fully clean (no modified/unstaged files) and all local commits are pushed, the repository would move into a high completeness range (>80%).
