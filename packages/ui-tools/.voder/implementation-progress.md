![Progress Chart](./progress-chart.png)

Projection: flat (no recent upward trend)

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: INCOMPLETE (59% ± 5% COMPLETE)

## OVERALL ASSESSMENT
- What’s complete:
  - Core infra and build/test pipeline run: TypeScript config, guarded vite.config.ts, package.json scripts for build/test/type-check exist and the canonical verification (type-check → build → test) has run successfully. EXECUTION is strong (95%).
  - A focused, correct implementation of the PostCSS factory exists and is exported (createPostCSSConfig). CODE_QUALITY of implemented code is high (88%) and current tests pass for the implemented surface.
  - ADRs and internal documentation (docs/decisions/) are comprehensive, and dependencies are generally up-to-date with no reported vulnerabilities from the last audit (DEPENDENCIES 85%, SECURITY 85%).

- What’s missing / incomplete (key gaps):
  - Feature completeness: large parts of the @voder/ui-tools API described in the spec are not implemented. Missing modules include createViteLibraryConfig, Vitest jsdom config factory, DOM testing helpers, accessibility utilities, linting config factories, template files, and other utilities. FUNCTIONALITY is therefore low (30%).
  - Testing breadth and coverage: only minimal smoke and package-structure tests exist; required categories (export-equivalence, package-installation integration, extensive unit tests for testing helpers and linting config generators, coverage thresholds) are not present. TESTING is inadequate (20%).
  - Documentation for consumers: there is no package README.md, no CHANGELOG, and no consumer-facing API reference documenting public exports and usage patterns (DOCUMENTATION 45%).
  - Version control hygiene: the working tree has unstaged/modified files (.voder/* files), and some build outputs are present in the repository. This prevents a clean publishable state (VERSION_CONTROL 25%).

- Sub-assessment recap:
  - FUNCTIONALITY: 30%
  - CODE_QUALITY: 88%
  - TESTING: 20%
  - EXECUTION: 95%
  - DOCUMENTATION: 45%
  - DEPENDENCIES: 85%
  - SECURITY: 85%
  - VERSION_CONTROL: 25%

Summary conclusion: The repository is runnable and the implemented portion is high quality and validated by tests and builds, but the package is missing most of its required API surface, test suites, and consumer documentation. Version-control issues must be addressed immediately. Because of these gaps the overall implementation is INCOMPLETE at ~59%.

## NEXT PRIORITY
(Ordered, focused, atomic steps — perform each, then run the canonical verification: npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test)

1. Restore a clean, committed repository state (top priority — addresses VERSION_CONTROL 25%):
   - Stage and commit the legitimate .voder metadata modifications (or stash/rollback any accidental edits). Ensure no modified/unstaged files remain.
   - If dist/ is tracked unintentionally, remove tracked build artifacts: git rm --cached -r dist/ && commit with message like "chore: remove tracked build artifacts (dist/)". Do this only if dist/ should be ignored per .gitignore policy.
   - After cleanup: git status must be clean. Then re-run canonical verification and capture console output.

2. Produce coverage baseline and run CI-style test (addresses TESTING 20%):
   - Run npm run test:ci to produce coverage and a baseline measurement.
   - Inspect coverage summary (console output) to understand gaps; capture results into .voder/history.md (console-first policy).
   - This gives concrete targets for incremental tests.

3. Implement the highest-value missing functional pieces incrementally (addresses FUNCTIONALITY 30%):
   - Priority implementation 1 (small, high-value): src/build/vite-library.ts — implement createViteLibraryConfig factory and a small corresponding test verifying formats and postcss presence.
   - Priority implementation 2: src/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts and src/testing/setup.ts (setup helpers) with unit tests; these enable adding jsdom-based tests for testing helpers.
   - Make each change as a single logical commit, run canonical verification after each commit.

4. Expand the test suite following the project's mandatory categories (addresses TESTING and FUNCTIONALITY):
   - Add export-equivalence tests and package-exports integration tests.
   - Add package-installation integration test (npm pack → temp consumer) once basic exports exist.
   - Add unit tests for testing helpers and accessibility utilities.
   - Aim to incrementally raise coverage; re-check after each test addition.

5. Add consumer-facing documentation and QA scripts (addresses DOCUMENTATION 45% and process requirements):
   - Add README.md at package root derived from the README template, including quickstart, API summary for currently exported functions, security posture, and license.
   - Add CHANGELOG.md stub.
   - Add markdown-lint generation script and lint:md / lint:md:fix scripts to package.json as mandated.
   - Add the standardized verify/lint/format scripts iteratively.

Rationale for priority: Version control problems block reliable verification and are trivial to fix — they should be resolved first. Next, produce coverage to understand test gaps. Then implement missing modules starting with small factories that unlock more testing, and iteratively expand tests and docs.

If you want, I can:
- produce the exact git commands and commits to clean the working tree (non-interactive),
- run npm run test:ci to capture coverage output,
- scaffold the first missing module with its minimal test (createViteLibraryConfig + test),
- or generate a README.md draft.

Which of those should I do next?



## FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT (30% ±10% COMPLETE)
- Implemented / present:
  - Core PostCSS helper: createPostCSSConfig is implemented, exported from src/index.ts and present in dist. This satisfies the minimal CSS preprocessing API.
  - Build tooling basics: TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json) and a guarded vite.config.ts exist to avoid optional-plugin failures.
  - Basic package metadata: package.json exists with sensible fields (type: module, main/types pointing into dist, license UNLICENSED) and a useful set of peer/devDependencies aligned with the ADRs.
  - Test infrastructure (partially): Vitest is configured as test runner in package.json scripts; there are smoke and package-structure tests that validate the minimal export and that package.json exports point to dist files. Compiled dist test artifacts are present.
  - Documentation / ADRs: Several ADRs and docs are present that define the intended architecture and requirements.

- Missing / incomplete (critical gaps vs the spec):
  - Major API surface unimplemented:
    - createViteLibraryConfig (src/build/vite-library.ts) — absent from src (only documented in prompts), not exported.
    - createVitestJsdomConfig (src/testing/vitest-jsdom.ts), testing helpers (renderComponent, simulateClick, waitForAnimation, etc.), accessibility utilities (expectAccessible, getAccessibilityViolations, accessibilityTests) — not present in source exports.
    - Linting configuration factories (createHTMLLintConfig, createCSSLintConfig, createAccessibilityLintConfig) — not implemented in src.
    - Utility modules (file-utils, config-utils) and templates referenced in the guide are not implemented.
  - Dual export strategy and integration: package.json exports are minimal (only "." → ./dist/src/index.js). The mandated dual export approach (dedicated paths like "./testing", "./postcss", "./eslint", "./typescript") is not implemented. Tests required to validate dual exports and package-installation integration are missing.
  - Mandatory scripts and QA pipeline parts:
    - Required scripts from the universal guide are missing (lint, lint:fix, format, format:check, lint:md, lint:md:fix, verify). prepare and voder scripts exist, but the full mandated verify/format/lint/md scripts are not present.
    - Markdown linting integration (.markdownlint.json generation via @voder/dev-config) is not implemented; lint:md scripts are absent.
  - Testing scope & coverage:
    - Only a small set of tests exist that cover the minimal PostCSS export and package export structure. The broad set of unit, integration, export-equivalence, package-installation tests and the high coverage thresholds required by policy are not met.
  - Accessibility & DOM testing tooling:
    - Although jest-axe and testing-library are installed as deps, the JS implementations and exported setup helpers (setupJsdomTestEnvironment) are not present in src.
  - Templates and examples: the templates/ directory referenced in the guide is not present in the source tree.
  - ADR & governance enforcement items:
    - Some ADRs exist, but dependency/ADR bundling rules (create ADR for each new dependency etc.) and automated tests to verify version alignment (e.g., vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8) are not implemented.
  - Packaging policy compliance surface:
    - The package partially follows build-output conventions (dist ignored but visible to LLM via .voderignore) and exports point to dist, but the exports object is sparse relative to the dual-export recommendation. There are no .d.ts sources for the broader API (only for the implemented postcss export).

- Overall assessment:
  - The repo contains a well-documented plan and initial scaffolding plus a correct, working minimal implementation for PostCSS config and a small set of tests validating those minimal pieces. However the majority of the required public API surface, testing utilities, linting factories, scripts, template files, and integration tests required by the @voder/ui-tools specification are missing.
  - Functionality is therefore incomplete: core single feature (PostCSS helper + minimal validation) is implemented, but most package responsibilities (Vite library config, Vitest jsdom config, DOM testing helpers, accessibility helpers, linting configs, templates, dual export strategy, required scripts and tests) are not yet implemented.

Estimated completion: 30% (±10%).

## CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT (88% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- The implemented code is small, focused, and largely correct: the PostCSS factory (src/build/postcss.ts) and the minimal public barrel (src/index.ts) follow the project patterns (ESM imports with .js extensions, typed exports). TypeScript config (NodeNext, strict) and the guarded vite.config.ts are sensible and avoid runtime startup failures for optional plugins.
- The test suite and runtime imports appear consistent with the ESM/TS setup used by Vitest: tests import ../src/index.js (resolved by the test runner/transformer to the TS source) and the package.json exports point at existing dist artifacts. Historical verification shows tsc and Vitest runs succeeded.
- Code style and documentation: source files include helpful comments and JSDoc-like descriptions; naming is clear and single-responsibility files are small and focused.

Issues and minor defects observed
- Committed build artifacts: dist/ files exist in the repository. While tests rely on them and package.json points to dist paths (and .voderignore intentionally makes dist visible to LLM), committing compiled outputs is generally undesirable and may lead to mismatches between source and compiled code. This is a process/packaging concern more than a code bug, but it can cause confusion.
- tsconfig includes "prettier.config.ts" in include but that file is not present. This is harmless for compilation but noisy and may be a leftover from policies/docs.
- vite.config.ts uses a broad any type for optional plugin handling. Functionally safe, but using narrower types or small helper types would improve maintainability.
- src/index.ts has a leading space in the file start (cosmetic).
- The package implements only a subset of the functionality described in the design docs (expected at this stage). There are many TODOs in the broader spec (testing helpers, lint config factories, etc.). Not a defect, just incomplete scope.
- A few runtime/dependency invariants depend on the environment (Node >=22.6 features, Vitest transforms). These are documented in ADRs, but may cause surprises for older environments.

Overall judgment
- The current code is functional and passes the intended automated checks (type-check, build, tests). There are no obvious correctness bugs in the implemented modules. The primary quality concerns are repository hygiene (tracked dist/) and a few minor hygiene issues (unused include, broad any typing). These are low-risk and straightforward to remediate in focused commits.

Actionable suggestions (high priority → low)
1. Stop tracking compiled outputs (if policy requires): ensure dist/ is gitignored and remove tracked dist/ via git rm --cached -r dist/ (already in the plan).
2. Remove or add the referenced prettier.config.ts to tsconfig include to eliminate stray references.
3. Tighten types in vite.config.ts (avoid any where possible).
4. Continue incremental implementation and tests for the remaining modules to raise overall coverage and completeness.

Final score rationale: code is correct and well-structured for the implemented surface, tests pass, and issues are mainly process/hygiene or minor typing concerns — hence ~88% quality with modest room for improvement.

## TESTING ASSESSMENT (20% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Current state: There are formal Vitest suites for basic package validation: tests/package-structure.test.ts (verifies package.json exports point into ./dist/ and files exist) and tests/smoke.test.ts (imports src/index.js and asserts createPostCSSConfig exists). Historical run notes indicate Vitest ran and all tests passed (Vitest v3.2.4 — 3 tests passed), so the existing tests execute successfully in the environment described.
- Passing vs completeness: Passing tests are a good start — smoke and structural checks confirm the minimal public API surface and that export paths are present. However the test surface is extremely limited relative to the package responsibilities and the project's testing policy.
- Coverage: There is no coverage artifact checked into the repo and no evidence the codebase meets the mandated coverage thresholds. The Universal Guide requires high coverage (90% overall, 100% public API/error scenarios). With only smoke and package-structure tests (and possibly one small build/postcss test referenced in history), the code coverage is almost certainly far below those targets.
- Missing/insufficient test categories (per the project's required list):
  - Export-equivalence tests (dual-export strategy) — not present.
  - Package-installation integration tests (packing the package and installing in a temp consumer) — not present.
  - Build configuration tests (createViteLibraryConfig factory) — not present in repo.
  - Testing utilities (jsdom helpers, accessibility helpers) unit tests — absent.
  - Linting configuration generation tests (HTML/CSS/accessibility linters) — absent.
  - Error-condition and edge-case tests for public API inputs / invalid configs — absent.
  - Automated checks enforcing dependency/version alignment (e.g., vitest / coverage provider alignment) — absent.
- Conclusion: Tests that exist are appropriate and currently passing for the minimal functionality they cover, but the overall test coverage and breadth are inadequate for the package's scope and for meeting the repository's mandated thresholds. I estimate testing completeness roughly 20% (±10%) — the CI/test harness is in place and small smoke/structure checks pass, but substantial test work remains to reach policy goals (coverage, integration, and category coverage).
- Recommended next testing steps (priority order):
  1. Run test:ci to produce coverage metrics and confirm current baseline (collect output to console/history).
  2. Add unit tests for createPostCSSConfig behavior (verify autoprefixer plugin options) and createViteLibraryConfig (formats, css.postcss presence).
  3. Add export-equivalence and package-exports integration tests (ensure both dedicated paths and main index provide identical functionality).
  4. Implement package-installation integration test (npm pack → temp consumer install) to validate real-world imports.
  5. Add test suites for testing helpers, accessibility utilities, and linting config generators.
  6. Gradually expand tests to cover public API, error scenarios, and enforce coverage thresholds (target 90%+).
- Short summary: Tests pass for a very small surface, but test coverage and scope are far from adequate for repository standards — substantial additional tests are required.

## EXECUTION ASSESSMENT (95% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The package build and test pipeline runs and is validated: `tsc --noEmit` succeeded, `tsc -p tsconfig.json` produced `dist/` artifacts, and `vitest` executed the test suite (3 tests) with all tests passing. The canonical verification sequence (`npm run type-check && npm run build && npm test`) has completed successfully on the current working tree. Remaining items are implementation/completeness work (more modules, exports, scripts, docs) rather than build/test failures.

<scratchpad>
Reviewing repository files for documentation coverage.

What exists:
- docs/decisions/ (multiple ADRs, including local and inherited) — good coverage of architecture decisions.
- docs/libraries/usage/ contains postcss.md and voder-dev-config.md — useful library usage docs.
- docs/decisions/README.md — indexes ADRs.
- prompts/ contains rich implementation guidance (development-ui-tools.md and universal-guide.md) — these are detailed but are internal prompt docs, not a public README.
- package.json has description, scripts, peer/dev deps — useful metadata.
- src and dist minimal exports exist; tests include usage examples in code (helpful, but not same as user-facing docs).
- .voder metadata files exist (history, plan) — internal process documentation.

What’s missing or inadequate:
- No README.md at package root (MANDATORY per Universal Guide). README must be self-contained, public-facing, with install, quickstart, license/security posture. Currently there is no package README accessible to consumers.
- No CHANGELOG.md present (template mentioned but not implemented).
- No API reference or markdown docs describing the public API of @voder/ui-tools (functions, types, examples). The prompts contain examples, but they are not published docs in README or docs/api.
- No docs for templates/ (the project structure mentions templates but these files are not present).
- No .markdownlint.json generated or instructions in repo—though docs mandate generation from @voder/dev-config.
- The docs that do exist are mostly internal (ADRs and library-usage files) and some reference other internal packages (e.g., @voder/dev-config) — README isolation requirement says README must be self-contained and reference published content only.
- No consumer-facing “Getting Started”, installation instructions, or explicit peer-dependency guidance in package-level docs (voder-dev-config.md lists peer deps but it’s for a different package).
- Security posture and license text are present in ADRs and other docs, but not consolidated into a package README.

Quality observations:
- ADR coverage is excellent — decisions are well documented and organized.
- Usage docs for PostCSS and voder-dev-config are good reference materials, but not packaged as a README for ui-tools.
- Tests and inline examples provide practical examples, but the repository lacks one primary, public-facing README and API docs that consumers expect.

Estimate reasoning:
- Strong architecture decision docs and some library usage content → positive points.
- Missing README, CHANGELOG, API reference, and consumer-facing installation/usage docs → major gaps.
- Overall I judge documentation to be less than halfway complete for a consumer-ready package but better than barebones because ADRs and usage docs exist.

Recommended next documentation tasks (brief):
1. Add README.md to package root using the README-template: purpose, compatibility, install, quickstart, API summary, security posture, license.
2. Add CHANGELOG.md stub.
3. Add an API reference (docs/api.md or README section) documenting exported functions/types from src/index.ts with examples.
4. Add .markdownlint.json generation script or include instructions and add lint:md scripts to package.json.
5. Ensure README contains only consumer-visible references (no internal paths).

Score: around mid‑40s to 50s; pick 45% with ±15% margin.
</scratchpad>

## DOCUMENTATION ASSESSMENT (45% ± 15% COMPLETE)
- The repository has strong internal documentation for architectural decisions (comprehensive ADRs under docs/decisions/) and useful library-usage notes for PostCSS and @voder/dev-config. However, it lacks critical consumer-facing documentation: there is no package README.md (required and self-contained), no CHANGELOG.md, and no dedicated API reference that documents the public exports of @voder/ui-tools. Existing docs are valuable but largely internal or targeted at maintainers/LLM agents rather than package consumers. To be consumer-ready, add a self-contained README (install, quick start, API summary, security posture, license), a CHANGELOG stub, and an API/docs page with examples; also generate or document the markdown-lint config and ensure README isolation rules are followed. Overall documentation is partially complete for maintainers (ADRs) but incomplete for users and consumers.

## DEPENDENCIES ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)
- Overall: dependencies look current and coherent with the package’s ADRs and goals — core packages are recent (TypeScript 5.9.2, Vitest 3.2.4, @vitest/coverage-v8 3.2.4, jsdom 26.x, PostCSS 8.x, Autoprefixer 10.x, markdownlint-cli2 0.18.1). Per the project history, an npm audit run reported zero vulnerabilities across the dependency tree, so there are no known significant security issues at the moment.
- Positives: vitest and its coverage provider are version-aligned per ADR (3.2.4), PostCSS/autoprefixer and jsdom versions are modern, and devDependencies satisfy local development needs.
- Risk / action items:
  - There is an inconsistency: package.json lists jest-axe in peerDependencies as "^9.0.0" but devDependencies include "^10.0.0". This can cause compatibility surprises (tests/run-time differences) and confusing peer guidance for consumers — align the peer/dev requirement (either update peer to ^10 or pin dev to ^9) and record any dependency change in an ADR per policy.
  - Transitive dependencies were reported but not individually inspected here; continue routine audits and run `npm audit` / `npm outdated` regularly to catch new advisories or stale packages.
  - Ensure runtime/consumer constraints (e.g., Node >=22.6.0 required for TS config usage) remain documented so consumers meet engine requirements.
- Verdict: current state appears secure and up-to-date with one noteworthy compatibility mismatch (jest-axe). Regular audits and an alignment fix for the jest-axe peer/dev mismatch will bring this to a fully clean state.

## SECURITY ASSESSMENT (85% ± 10% COMPLETE)

- Summary
  - The codebase implements a small, development-only tooling package with minimal runtime surface area. There are no obvious insecure coding patterns (no eval, no deserialization of untrusted data, no network calls, no secrets in source). Most security risk comes from supply-chain and dev-time execution (devDependencies, dynamic plugin imports, test helpers that execute child processes in example code), not from business-logic vulnerabilities in the package source itself.

- Findings (issues & risks)
  1. Supply-chain risk (HIGH/Primary)
     - The project depends on many third‑party devDependencies (vitest, postcss, autoprefixer, jsdom, jest-axe, markdownlint-cli2, etc.). Compromise of any dependency or its maintainer account could permit malicious code execution when running build/test/prepare scripts.
     - The code includes a dynamic import of an optional Vite plugin ("vite-plugin-inline-source") in vite.config.ts. Dynamic import increases the attack surface because an attacker who can introduce or modify that package/version in node_modules (or via malicious registry/mirror) could execute arbitrary code during build.
     - ADRs mention registry-mirror policy (good), but ensure lockfile integrity and registry hardening are enforced.

  2. Execution of developer tooling (MEDIUM)
     - Running npm scripts (prepare, build, test, verify) executes arbitrary code from devDependencies and lifecycle scripts. If CI or developer environments use untrusted package mirrors, this can be exploited.
     - Example and doc snippets include execSync usage (in docs/tests examples). If any test or script used in CI runs child processes with untrusted input, it could be a vector for command injection. In the current tracked tests, there is no direct execSync usage, but caution is warranted if similar patterns are added.

  3. Node module resolution / ESM surface (LOW → MEDIUM)
     - The project uses NodeNext and ESM resolution, and exposes .voderignore-negated dist/ files to LLM tooling. If build outputs are later consumed in insecure contexts, ensure no accidental inclusion of sensitive content.
     - Prettier and other config files in TypeScript require running Node with experimental flags — ensure CI runner configuration is controlled and not exposing secrets via NODE_OPTIONS.

  4. Test and tool helpers running in jsdom (LOW)
     - Tests that use jsdom and jest-axe run in an environment that mimics browser APIs; these do not access network by default. However, misconfigured tests that reach out to network or read/write files could leak data if not isolated.

  5. Lack of explicit integrity checks (MEDIUM)
     - No evidence of package lock signing, checksum verification, or automated vulnerability policy enforcement beyond a single `npm audit` run. The ADRs recommend audits and registry-mirror policy, but enforcement must be automated in CI.

- Best-practice recommendations / mitigations
  1. Harden supply chain
     - Enforce lockfile usage (package-lock.json) in CI and require `npm ci` for reproducible installs.
     - Enable lockfile integrity checks and consider using tools like `npm audit`, Snyk, Dependabot, or OSS-Fuzz in CI to detect vulnerabilities continuously.
     - Use registry mirrors/trusted registries with read-only access where possible and pin critical dev tools when ADRs require exact alignment (already done for vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8).
     - Consider enabling npm's "fund" and audit policies or using `corepack`/pnpm with checksum verification.

  2. Review dynamic imports and optional plugin patterns
     - Restrict or explicitly document optional plugin usage. For dynamic imports like vite-plugin-inline-source, prefer explicit opt-in configuration and validate the plugin's integrity/version before invoking it.
     - In CI, disallow use of unreviewed optional plugins or run builds inside a sandboxed environment.

  3. Minimize runtime execution exposure
     - Ensure any child process execution (execSync) is only used with sanitized/static inputs. Avoid constructing shell commands from untrusted input.
     - Run tests and build steps in isolated environment with least privileges, and avoid mounting secrets into test containers unnecessarily.

  4. Automate and enforce ADR policies in CI
     - When ADRs require an ADR for new dependencies, include automated checks that flag package.json changes without ADRs.
     - Add tests that assert required versions or presence/absence of certain dependencies (e.g., vitest/@vitest/coverage-v8 alignment test referenced in ADR).

  5. Logging and secrets
     - Ensure no secrets are committed. .gitignore already blocks .env and many sensitive file types — keep that up to date.
     - Avoid printing secrets in console output (history.md captures console output).

  6. Regular updates and monitoring
     - Keep devDependencies up-to-date; run scheduled dependency scans and address high/critical findings promptly.
     - Consider adopting signed packages / reproducible builds for higher assurance.

- Conclusion
  - No immediate software-level vulnerabilities (like SQL injection, XSS, deserialization, or unsafe eval) are present in the tracked source code; the primary security exposure is supply-chain and the execution context of developer tooling. With enforced CI policies (locked installs, automated audits, strict registry mirrors), review of dynamic imports, and safe use of subprocesses, residual risk can be reduced to acceptable levels for a dev-tool package.

## VERSION CONTROL ASSESSMENT (25% ± 5% COMPLETE)
- The repository is not in a clean, publishable state: there are unstaged/modified files in the working tree (7 modified files listed by git status: .voder/history.md, .voder/implementation-progress.md, .voder/last-action.md, .voder/plan.md, .voder/progress-chart.png, .voder/progress-log-areas.csv, .voder/progress-log.csv). Because there are uncommitted changes, the project cannot be rated above the 30% ceiling in your rules.
- Synchronization with remote is OK: the local branch is up to date with origin/main (no unpushed commits). However, file-tracking is incomplete: the summary shows "Project files tracked: 22/28" (not all expected project files are tracked), and there are indications to verify whether build outputs (dist/) are incorrectly tracked (dist/ is listed in repository contents while .gitignore declares dist/). Overall this combination of unstaged changes and less-than-complete tracking yields a low version-control completeness (≈25%).
