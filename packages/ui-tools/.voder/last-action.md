## Plan

```
Run this from the project root to add the missing test runtime helper as a devDependency and update package-lock.json:

npm install --no-audit --no-fund --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom

What this does:
- Updates package.json (adds @testing-library/jest-dom under devDependencies)
- Produces/updates package-lock.json with the installed package
- Must be executed in the repository root (where package.json lives) on a POSIX shell (bash/zsh)
```
