## Plan

```
<scratchpad>
Goal: synchronize local commits on branch main to remote 'origin' by pushing.
Preconditions: run from project root; git is configured with remote 'origin'; non-interactive push.
Effect: publishes local commits (branch is currently ahead by 3) to origin/main so remote matches local.
Command must be POSIX-safe and non-interactive: use git push origin main.

Run this from the project root to push local commits to the remote:

git push origin main
```
