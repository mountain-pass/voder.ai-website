## Plan

```
<scratchpad>
Dist/ is currently tracked in the repository even though .gitignore includes dist/. We need to remove tracked build artifacts from the git index and commit that removal in a single non-interactive command.
</scratchpad>

Run this single command from the project root to remove tracked build artifacts under dist/ from the index and commit the removal (non-interactive):

git rm --cached -r dist/ && git commit -m "chore: remove tracked build artifacts (dist/)" || true
```
