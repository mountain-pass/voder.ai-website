## Plan

```
<scratchpad>
We must provide only the first action: push the outstanding local commit. Give exact command and brief context: branch main, ahead by 1 commit, goal is to synchronize remote. Mention expected result and non-interactive nature. Do not include any other commands or steps.
</scratchpad>

Action goal: publish the outstanding local commit on branch main to the remote repository (synchronize branch).

Run this single non-interactive command from the project root:
git push origin main

Expected outcome:
- The local commit that is currently ahead (branch main) will be pushed to origin/main.
- On success, git will print push progress and summary to the console (stdout/stderr), which will be captured in .voder/history.md.
- After completion, the branch should be in sync with origin and you can proceed with the verification step.
