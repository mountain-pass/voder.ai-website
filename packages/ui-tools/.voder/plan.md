## NOW

**Address Minor Quality Improvements**: The project is 98% complete and production-ready with all critical thresholds met (90.21% branch coverage exceeds 90% requirement). Focus on final quality polish:

1. **Fix ESLint Deprecation Warnings**: Update the 3 remaining ESLint warnings in `tests/testing/setup.test.ts` by replacing deprecated MediaQueryList methods (`addListener`/`removeListener`) with modern `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` APIs. This is a 15-minute fix that will achieve zero warnings.

2. **Final Verification Run**: Execute `npm run verify` multiple times to ensure consistent passing of all quality gates and validate production readiness. All tests currently pass (98/98) with excellent coverage.

3. **Production Release Preparation**: Review package.json metadata, version strategy, and publishing configuration to ensure the package is ready for production deployment and consumption by UI component libraries.

This minimal effort (estimated 30 minutes) will achieve 100% quality compliance and finalize the production-ready package.

## NEXT

- **Documentation Finalization**: Update any remaining documentation to reflect the completed status and production readiness. Ensure README badges, API documentation, and usage examples are current and accurate.

- **Package Publishing Setup**: Configure npm publishing workflows, validate package exports in a real consumer environment, and prepare release notes documenting the complete feature set and quality achievements.

- **Integration Validation**: Test the package in a real UI component library environment to validate all configurations work correctly when consumed by actual projects.

- **Version 1.0.0 Release**: Prepare and execute the official 1.0.0 release with proper git tagging, changelog updates, and publication to npm registry (if applicable) or internal package registry.

## LATER

- **Package Ecosystem Expansion**: Develop companion packages for specific UI frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte) that build upon the core ui-tools foundation with framework-specific testing utilities and build optimizations.

- **Advanced Developer Tooling**: Create CLI tools for scaffolding new component libraries, configuration validation utilities, automated migration helpers, and interactive setup wizards to improve developer experience.

- **Enhanced Integration Testing**: Develop comprehensive integration test suites that validate the package against real-world component library scenarios, including complex build configurations and edge cases.

- **Performance Optimization**: Analyze and optimize build times, test execution performance, and memory usage. Consider implementing parallel processing for large test suites and build optimizations for faster development cycles.

- **Advanced Accessibility Framework**: Expand accessibility testing capabilities with automated visual regression testing, comprehensive ARIA validation, keyboard navigation testing automation, and integration with professional accessibility scanning tools.

- **CI/CD Pipeline Templates**: Create comprehensive template repositories and example workflows for integrating ui-tools into various CI/CD systems (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps) with automated quality gates and deployment workflows.

- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Implement usage analytics and error reporting to understand how the package is being used in production and identify areas for improvement or common configuration issues.

- **Documentation Platform**: Build an interactive documentation site with live examples, configuration playground, and comprehensive guides for teams adopting component library development practices.
