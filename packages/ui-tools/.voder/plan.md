## NOW

**Achieve 90% Branch Coverage Threshold**: The project is 97% complete but branch coverage is at 89.24% (needs 90%). Add targeted unit tests to cover the specific uncovered branches that are preventing CI compliance:

1. **`scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts`** (0% coverage): Add basic unit tests to validate the markdownlint configuration generation and file output. This single file is completely untested and represents the largest coverage gap.

2. **`src/build/vite-library.ts`** (66.66% branch coverage): Add test for line 45 uncovered branch - likely an edge case in configuration merging or plugin handling.

3. **`src/testing/helpers.ts`** (87.17% branch coverage): Add tests for uncovered branches on lines 63-64, 84-89 - these appear to be error handling paths in component rendering or animation utilities.

4. **`src/testing/setup.ts`** (88.46% branch coverage): Add tests for uncovered branches on lines 48-49, 135 - likely edge cases in DOM environment setup or Canvas mock initialization.

This focused effort (estimated 1-2 hours) will push branch coverage from 89.24% to 90%+ and achieve full CI compliance with `npm run verify` passing completely.

## NEXT

- **Final Quality Gate Validation**: Run complete `npm run verify` suite multiple times to ensure consistent passing of all quality gates (type-check, lint, format, build, test with coverage threshold met).

- **Address Minor Linting Warnings**: Fix the 2 remaining ESLint warnings for deprecated MediaQueryList methods (`addListener`/`removeListener`) in test code by updating to modern APIs.

- **Commit and Document Completion**: Once coverage threshold is met, commit the test improvements and update documentation to reflect 100% CI compliance status and project completion.

- **Prepare for Production Release**: Review package.json metadata, ensure proper version tagging strategy, and validate package publishing configuration for production deployment.

## LATER

- **Enhanced Integration Testing**: Develop integration tests that verify the package works correctly when consumed by real UI component libraries, including testing the generated Vite and Vitest configurations against actual component builds and test scenarios.

- **Performance Optimization**: Review build times and test execution performance, potentially optimizing slow-running integration tests (currently ~4-5 second test runs) or build steps.

- **Advanced Accessibility Testing Framework**: Expand accessibility testing utilities with comprehensive examples, additional jest-axe configuration presets for different testing scenarios (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, color contrast validation), and integration with automated accessibility scanning tools.

- **Advanced Configuration Merging**: Implement sophisticated configuration merging capabilities for PostCSS plugins and Vite configurations to handle complex edge cases in consumer projects, including conditional plugin loading and environment-specific optimizations.

- **Developer Experience Enhancements**: Add CLI tools for project scaffolding, configuration validation utilities, migration helpers for teams adopting the tooling, and interactive setup wizards for new component library projects.

- **CI/CD Integration Templates**: Provide comprehensive example workflows and configurations for integrating the quality tools into various CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins), including automated quality gates and release workflows.
