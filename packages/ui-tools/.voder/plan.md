## NOW

**Increase Test Coverage to Meet 90% Threshold**: The project is 98% complete but test coverage is at 71.62% (needs 90%). Add targeted unit tests to cover the primary coverage gaps:

1. **`src/testing/setup.ts`** (43% coverage): Add tests for Canvas-2D mock initialization, DOM environment setup error scenarios, and alternative DOM API polyfills
2. **`src/testing/accessibility.ts`** (64.38% coverage): Add tests for error handling paths in `getAccessibilityViolations`, `expectAccessible` with malformed DOM, and edge cases in ARIA attribute validation
3. **`src/testing/helpers.ts`** (72.28% coverage): Add tests for error scenarios in `renderComponent` (invalid elements, mount failures), edge cases in event simulation, and timeout handling in animation helpers
4. **`scripts/generate-markdownlint-config.ts`** (0% coverage): Add unit tests to validate the markdownlint configuration generation and file output

This focused testing effort (estimated 2-4 hours) will push coverage above the 90% threshold and achieve full CI compliance.

## NEXT

- **Commit and Document Coverage Achievement**: Once coverage threshold is met, commit the test improvements and update documentation to reflect 100% CI compliance status.

- **Performance Optimization Review**: Review build times and test execution performance, potentially optimizing slow-running integration tests or build steps.

- **Final Quality Gate Validation**: Run complete `npm run verify` suite multiple times to ensure consistent passing of all quality gates (type-check, lint, format, build, test with coverage).

- **Prepare for Production Release**: Review package.json metadata, ensure proper version tagging strategy, and validate package publishing configuration.

## LATER

- **Advanced Integration Testing**: Develop integration tests that verify the package works correctly when consumed by real UI component libraries, including testing the generated Vite and Vitest configurations against actual component builds and test scenarios.

- **Enhanced Accessibility Testing Framework**: Expand accessibility testing utilities with comprehensive examples, additional jest-axe configuration presets for different testing scenarios (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, color contrast validation), and integration with automated accessibility scanning tools.

- **Performance Testing Utilities**: Add performance testing helpers for UI components including rendering time measurement, interaction performance validation, memory usage tracking, and bundle size impact analysis for component libraries.

- **Advanced Configuration Merging**: Implement sophisticated configuration merging capabilities for PostCSS plugins and Vite configurations to handle complex edge cases in consumer projects, including conditional plugin loading and environment-specific optimizations.

- **Developer Experience Enhancements**: Add CLI tools for project scaffolding, configuration validation utilities, migration helpers for teams adopting the tooling, and interactive setup wizards for new component library projects.

- **CI/CD Integration Templates**: Provide comprehensive example workflows and configurations for integrating the quality tools into various CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins), including automated quality gates and release workflows.
