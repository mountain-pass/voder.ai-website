## Template Usage Guide

### Problem Naming Convention

- **{PROBLEM-NAME}**: Brief, descriptive name using kebab-case format
- **Examples**: `mobile-3d-cube-size-jump-scroll`, `text-flash-before-3d-render`, `login-form-validation-error`

### Status Progression

1. **{name}.open.md**: Initial problem documentation and investigation
2. **{name}.known-error.md**: Workaround implemented, root cause documented, fix story created
3. **{name}.closed.md**: Permanent fix implemented and verified

### Impact Assessment Guidelines

**Analytics-Based Impact Calculation**:

- Use MS Clarity Data Export API to get current device breakdown
- Calculate affected user percentage based on problem scope
- Mobile-only: Use mobile percentage
- Mobile + Tablet: Combine mobile and tablet percentages
- All devices: 100% regardless of breakdown

**Impact Levels**:

- **High (3)**: >70% of page views affected OR critical business impact
- **Medium (2)**: 30-70% of page views affected OR functionality limitations
- **Low (1)**: <30% of page views affected OR edge case problems

**Likelihood Levels**:

- **High (3)**: Consistent occurrence or affects majority of users/scenarios
- **Medium (2)**: Intermittent occurrence or affects significant subset of users
- **Low (1)**: Rare occurrence or specific conditions required

**Priority Matrix (Impact Ã— Likelihood)**:

- **Priority 9**: Critical - immediate workaround required
- **Priority 6**: High - workaround within 24 hours
- **Priority 4**: Medium - workaround within week
- **Priority 3**: Low - address in next sprint
- **Priority 1**: Minimal - address when convenient

### Workaround Strategy

**Feature Disabling as Preferred Workaround**:

- Service stability takes priority over feature availability
- Disabling problematic features is acceptable and often the best approach
- Document user communication strategy when features are disabled
- Ensure business impact is clearly assessed and communicated

### Integration Requirements

**Story Management Integration**:

- All permanent fix stories must follow existing story template structure
- Stories must include clear acceptance criteria for problem resolution verification
- Dependencies must be properly documented with story numbers
- Stories must be testable through problem non-recurrence verification

**Decision Management Integration**:

- Reference relevant architectural decisions when applicable
- Problems may inform future architectural decisions
- Cross-reference with existing ADRs for context
