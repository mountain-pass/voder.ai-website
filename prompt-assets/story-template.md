# {XXX.X-STORY-NAME}: {Brief Story Description}

## Release Goal

_{Release-level goal that this story contributes to - connects to user story mapping journey phases}_

Brief explanation of how this story fits into the overall release objectives and user journey. Reference the specific release (e.g., "Release 0.5: Problem Validation" or "Release 1.0: MVP Launch").

## How This Story Contributes

Explain the specific value this story provides within the broader context. Answer: "Why is this story important right now?" and "How does it enable other stories or release goals?"

## User Story

**Format**: So that {VALUE/OUTCOME}, as a {PERSONA}, I want {FEATURE/CAPABILITY}.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can be developed independently of other stories
- **Negotiable**: Details can be refined during implementation
- **Valuable**: Delivers clear value to the specified persona
- **Estimable**: Scope is clear enough for estimation
- **Small**: Can be completed within a single iteration/sprint
- **Testable**: Acceptance criteria provide clear success conditions

## Acceptance Criteria

Use checkbox format for clear completion tracking:

- [ ] **Core Functionality**: Primary feature works as expected
- [ ] **Quality Standards**: Meets performance, accessibility, security requirements
- [ ] **Integration**: Works properly with existing system components
- [ ] **User Experience**: Provides smooth, intuitive user interaction
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles edge cases and failures
- [ ] **Documentation**: Implementation is properly documented

## Requirements (Current Implementation or To Be Implemented)

Document specific technical requirements using the format:

- **REQ-{CATEGORY}-{NAME}**: Description of requirement
- **IMPL-{COMPONENT}**: Already implemented feature (reference existing code)

Examples:

- **REQ-PERF-LOAD**: Page loads in under 2 seconds
- **REQ-ACCESS-WCAG**: Meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- **REQ-MOBILE-RESPONSIVE**: Works on mobile devices 320px and up
- **IMPL-ESLINT-CONFIG**: ESLint v9 flat configuration in eslint.config.ts

## Dependencies

List other stories this story depends on, using numbered story references:

- {XXX.X-DEPENDENT-STORY} (explanation of why this dependency exists)

**Dependency Rules**:

- Story numbers MUST be greater than all dependency story numbers
- Dependencies should be from in-scope stories when possible
- Cross-release dependencies should be clearly justified
- No circular dependencies allowed

## Implementation Notes (Optional)

Additional context for developers:

- Technical considerations
- Integration points
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations
- Testing strategy

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to appropriate environment
- [ ] Stakeholder acceptance confirmed
