| _Create curiosity and draw them in_ | _Problem resonates with their experience_ | _They love our philosophy and vision_ | _They believe in our solution approach_    | _They're convinced and excited_ |
| **Brand Entry**                     | **Problem Space: Vibe Coding Crisis**     | **The Why: Spec-Driven Intent**       | **Metaphor + Vision: Autonomous Delivery** | **Outcome Focus + Closing**     |

**Journey Narrative:**
Visitors enter curious ("Why does AI coding feel like magic at first but become a mess?") → Recognize their pain (vibe coding without specs leads to fragile codebases and burnout) → Understand the philosophy (software starts with structured intent) → See the alternative (prompt-as-source autonomous delivery) → Want to sign up for beta

## Personas

- 🎯 **PRIMARY**: Venture Capitalists (Hidden Audience) - _Evaluating investment opportunity in spec-driven developer tooling_
- 👑 **Founders & Product Leaders** (Stated Target) - _Strategic decision makers seeking sustainable AI-assisted development_
- 🔧 **CTOs & Engineering Managers** - _Technical validators concerned about AI-generated technical debt and team burnout_
