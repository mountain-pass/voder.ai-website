What level of testing automation do you want?

- A) Basic unit tests for critical functions
- B) Component testing for UI interactions
- C) Integration tests for full user flows
- D) Visual regression tests for design consistency
- E) Performance/accessibility automated testing

### **4. Deployment & Operations**

How do you envision the deployment process?

- Manual builds and uploads
- Automated CI/CD with branch previews
- Staged deployments (dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí production)
- Rollback capabilities and monitoring

### **5. Team Collaboration**

Who else will be working on this codebase?
