| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| _Startup engine analysis, market validation_ | _Capture intent in structured specifications_ | _Compile, test, and validate assumptions_ | _Track results, measure success_ | _Edit specs and iterate_           |
| **Market Research & Intent Capture**         | **Spec Definition & Alignment**               | **Autonomous Execution & Testing**        | **Analytics & Performance**      | **Spec Refinement & Optimization** |

**Strategic Workflow:**
Product owners capture strategic intent in structured specifications without touching code. The autonomous compilation pipeline executes against these specs, enabling rapid experimentation and iteration. This separation of intent from implementation enables cross-team alignment, platform portability, and measurable business outcomes while maintaining traceability from strategy to execution.

## Personas

- 🎯 **PRIMARY**: Product Owner - _Making strategic product decisions through intent capture and spec-driven iteration_
- 📊 **Business Analyst** - _Analyzing market opportunities and validating business hypotheses through experimentation_
- 💼 **Stakeholders** - _Understanding business progress through spec traceability and measurable outcomes_
- 🏢 **Portfolio Managers** (Secondary) - _Scaling spec-driven product development across multiple teams_
