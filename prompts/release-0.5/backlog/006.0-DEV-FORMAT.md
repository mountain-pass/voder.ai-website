# DEV-FORMAT: Automated Code Formatting

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Provide immediate feedback loops for code quality through comprehensive linting and testing tools that catch issues during development, ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the vibe rot problem validation website.

## How This Story Contributes

This story eliminates style debates and ensures consistent code formatting across all file types, allowing developers to focus on logic rather than formatting while maintaining professional code appearance automatically.

## User Story

So that I can maintain consistent code formatting without manual effort and eliminate style inconsistencies, as a frontend developer, I want automated code formatting that standardizes style across all files and integrates seamlessly with my development workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Prettier successfully formats all supported file types (.js, .ts, .css, .html, .md, .json)
- `npm run format` command formats entire codebase consistently
- `npm run format:check` command validates formatting without changes
- Configuration stored in TypeScript (prettier.config.ts) for consistency
- Formatting integrates with development workflow (format on save)
- Zero style inconsistencies after formatting

## Requirements

- **IMPL-PRETTIER**: Prettier v3.6+ for automated code formatting
- **IMPL-TS-CONFIG**: prettier.config.ts configuration file in TypeScript
- **IMPL-NPM-SCRIPTS**: npm run format and format:check scripts
- **IMPL-ESLINT-INTEGRATION**: eslint-config-prettier to prevent ESLint conflicts

## Dependencies

- 001.0-PO-STORY-MANAGEMENT (requires story tracking framework)
- 004.0-DEV-TYPESCRIPT (formatting rules work with TypeScript)
- 002.0-DEV-ENV-NODE (requires Node.js environment for Prettier)
- 003.0-DEV-ENV-DEPS (requires npm dependencies for Prettier packages)
