# DEV-LINT-CSS: CSS Code Quality and Style Linting

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Provide immediate feedback loops for code quality through comprehensive linting and testing tools that catch issues during development, ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the vibe rot problem validation website.

## How This Story Contributes

This story enables developers to receive immediate feedback about CSS code quality, style consistency, and best practices as they write stylesheets, ensuring visual consistency and maintainable CSS code throughout development.

## User Story

So that I can maintain consistent CSS code quality and catch style issues immediately, as a frontend developer, I want automated CSS linting that validates styles, enforces conventions, and reports errors with clear, actionable feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Stylelint successfully lints all .css files with modern configuration
- Linting includes standard CSS rules, CSS modules support, and property ordering
- `npm run lint:css` command executes successfully with clear error reports
- `npm run lint:css:fix` command automatically fixes auto-fixable issues
- Configuration uses modern .mjs format following official stylelint documentation
- Configuration excludes generated files (coverage/, dist/, build/, node_modules/)
- Zero false positives on correctly written CSS code

## Requirements

- **IMPL-STYLELINT**: Stylelint v15 with modern configuration
- **IMPL-STANDARD-CONFIG**: stylelint-config-standard for base CSS rules
- **IMPL-CSS-MODULES**: stylelint-config-css-modules for CSS modules support
- **IMPL-ORDER-PLUGIN**: stylelint-order plugin for consistent property ordering
- **IMPL-MJS-CONFIG**: stylelint.config.mjs using modern ES module format
- **IMPL-NPM-SCRIPTS**: npm run lint:css and lint:css:fix scripts with ignore patterns

## Dependencies

- 001.0-PO-STORY-MANAGEMENT (requires story tracking framework)
- 004.0-DEV-TYPESCRIPT (CSS linting in TypeScript build process)
- 002.0-DEV-ENV-NODE (requires Node.js environment for stylelint)
