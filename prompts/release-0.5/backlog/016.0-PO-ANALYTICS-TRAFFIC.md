# PO-ANALYTICS-TRAFFIC: Track Traffic Sources and Referrers

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Provide immediate feedback loops for code quality through comprehensive linting and testing tools that catch issues during development, ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the vibe rot problem validation website.

## How This Story Contributes

This story enables the product owner to understand where visitors are coming from (LinkedIn, direct, search, etc.), which is critical for validating the LinkedIn-first strategy and understanding which channels drive the most relevant traffic to the vibe rot validation.

## User Story

So that I can understand which channels are driving visitors to the vibe rot validation site and validate our LinkedIn strategy, as a product owner, I want to track traffic sources and referrers with clear channel attribution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Traffic sources are accurately categorized (direct, social, search, referral)
- LinkedIn traffic is specifically identified and tracked
- Referrer URLs are captured for detailed analysis
- Traffic source reports show percentages and trends
- Data includes both acquisition date and source attribution
- Reports distinguish between organic and paid traffic sources

## Requirements (to be implemented)

- **REQ-SOURCE-TRACKING**: Automatic traffic source detection and categorization
- **REQ-LINKEDIN-ATTRIBUTION**: Specific LinkedIn traffic identification
- **REQ-REFERRER-CAPTURE**: Full referrer URL and domain tracking
- **REQ-CHANNEL-REPORTS**: Traffic source breakdown reporting
- **REQ-UTM-SUPPORT**: UTM parameter tracking for campaign attribution

## Dependencies

- 013.0-BIZ-BRAND-ENTRY (need working website to track traffic sources)
- 005.0-DEV-BUILD-VITE (need build system to deploy tracking code)
