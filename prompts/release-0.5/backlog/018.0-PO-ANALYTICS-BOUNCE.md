# PO-ANALYTICS-BOUNCE: Track Bounce Rate and Exit Behavior

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Provide immediate feedback loops for code quality through comprehensive linting and testing tools that catch issues during development, ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the vibe rot problem validation website.

## How This Story Contributes

This story enables the product owner to understand visitor behavior by tracking bounce rates and exit patterns, providing essential feedback on whether the vibe rot message immediately resonates or causes visitors to leave without engaging.

## User Story

So that I can understand if the vibe rot message immediately engages visitors or causes them to leave, as a product owner, I want to track bounce rates and identify exit patterns to optimize content effectiveness.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Bounce rate is accurately calculated and reported (single page sessions)
- Exit page tracking identifies where visitors commonly leave
- Bounce rate can be segmented by traffic source and device
- Quick bounce (under 10 seconds) vs. considered exit (after reading) distinction
- Reports show bounce rate trends over time
- Bounce rate benchmarks help identify improvement opportunities

## Requirements (to be implemented)

- **REQ-BOUNCE-CALCULATION**: Accurate bounce rate measurement and calculation
- **REQ-EXIT-TRACKING**: Page-specific exit behavior tracking
- **REQ-ENGAGEMENT-BOUNCE**: Differentiate engaged vs. immediate bounces
- **REQ-SEGMENTED-BOUNCE**: Bounce rate by traffic source and device
- **REQ-BOUNCE-ALERTS**: Alerts for unusually high bounce rates

## Dependencies

- 014.0-PO-ANALYTICS-PAGEVIEWS (requires basic page tracking before measuring bounce rates)
- 013.0-BIZ-BRAND-ENTRY (requires functioning website to track bounce behavior)
