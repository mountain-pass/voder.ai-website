# PO-ANALYTICS-ENGAGEMENT: Track Time on Site and Session Duration

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Provide immediate feedback loops for code quality through comprehensive linting and testing tools that catch issues during development, ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the vibe rot problem validation website.

## How This Story Contributes

This story enables the product owner to understand visitor engagement by measuring how long people spend on the site and whether they're actually reading the vibe rot content, providing critical feedback on message resonance and content effectiveness.

## User Story

So that I can understand if visitors are engaging with the vibe rot content and reading the problem description, as a product owner, I want to track time on site, session duration, and page engagement metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Average time on site is accurately measured and reported
- Session duration tracking works across all devices and browsers
- Time spent on specific pages (especially vibe rot content) is tracked
- Engagement metrics distinguish between quick bounces and actual reading
- Reports show engagement trends over time
- Data includes both averages and distribution patterns

## Requirements (to be implemented)

- **REQ-SESSION-TRACKING**: Accurate session duration measurement
