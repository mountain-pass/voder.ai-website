# PAIN-1: Vibe Rot Problem Description

## Release Goal

_"Test if ONE vibe rot description resonates strongly with founders"_

Release 0.5 is the absolute minimum test of our riskiest assumption: can we articulate the vibe rot problem in a way that founders immediately recognize as their exact problem? This release focuses purely on message validation before investing in larger development efforts.

## How This Story Contributes

This story is the core test of our most critical assumption. The entire release succeeds or fails based on whether founders have strong "YES, that's exactly my problem!" reactions to our vibe rot description. All other stories in this release exist to support this test.

## User Story

So that I feel understood and validated in my current development frustrations, as a founder who has experienced AI coding challenges, I want to see my "vibe rot" experience accurately described in a way that makes me think "Finally, someone gets it."

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Single, clear description of vibe rot using best-performing LinkedIn post framing
- [ ] Emotional language that triggers recognition ("That's exactly what happened to me!")
- [ ] Specific examples founders can relate to (empty .md files, broken scripts, etc.)
- [ ] Simple visual representation of the problem (before/after, chaos illustration)
- [ ] Call-to-action asking "Does this resonate with your experience?"
- [ ] Analytics tracking for engagement and emotional response

## Requirements (from Startup Engine Analysis)

- **Message Resonance**: Target >70% "This is exactly my problem" responses
- **Emotional Connection**: Strong emotional reactions (frustration, relief at being understood)
- **Problem Framing**: Present as urgent/expensive rather than just annoying
- **Visual Support**: Simple representation of codebase degradation over time
- **Validation Method**: Clear way for founders to indicate resonance level

## Dependencies

- 013.0-BIZ-BRAND-ENTRY (requires foundational branding and visual system)
- 005.0-DEV-BUILD-VITE (component build system for production deployment)
