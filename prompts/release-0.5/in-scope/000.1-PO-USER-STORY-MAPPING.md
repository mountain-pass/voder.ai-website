# PO-USER-STORY-MAPPING: User Story Mapping Framework

## Release Goal

_"Release 0.5: Essential Strategic Foundation - Create comprehensive user story maps to guide product development and release planning"_

Establish user story mapping framework following Jeff Patton methodology to create visual product roadmaps that align development activities with customer journey and business value delivery. This foundational planning activity translates startup machine analysis into actionable development roadmap.

## How This Story Contributes

This foundational planning story bridges strategic analysis and tactical development by creating visual product roadmaps that ensure development activities align with customer value and business objectives. Without user story mapping, development proceeds without clear understanding of customer journey and value delivery sequence.

**Note: This is a planning and design story that requires facilitation, mapping sessions, and strategic documentation rather than code implementation.**

## User Story

So that I can translate strategic insights into actionable development roadmap that delivers value to customers, as a product owner, I want comprehensive user story maps that visualize the customer journey and guide release planning decisions.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can be completed through mapping sessions and documentation
- **Negotiable**: Map structure and level of detail can be refined based on insights
- **Valuable**: Provides visual roadmap that aligns development with customer value
- **Estimable**: Clear scope for mapping sessions and documentation
- **Small**: Focused on planning and mapping rather than implementation
- **Testable**: Success measured by completed maps that inform development decisions

## User Story Mapping Framework

### Mapping Process

1. **Frame the Journey**: Define customer journey from awareness to conversion
2. **Map User Activities**: Identify what customers do at each phase
3. **Add User Stories**: Detail specific functionality needed
4. **Prioritize and Slice**: Organize stories into releases by value
5. **Validate and Refine**: Review maps with stakeholders and iterate

### Mapping Artifacts

- **Journey Backbone**: High-level customer activities across journey phases
- **User Stories**: Detailed functionality organized under activities
- **Release Slices**: Horizontal cuts through the map defining releases
- **Personas**: Target user types with specific needs and contexts
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes for each journey phase

### Release Planning Criteria

- **Business Value**: Customer and business impact of functionality
- **Technical Dependencies**: Implementation sequence requirements
- **Risk Mitigation**: Address highest-risk assumptions early
- **Learning Opportunities**: Maximize learning from customer feedback
- **Resource Constraints**: Align with available development capacity

## Validation and Testing

- [ ] **Map Validation**: Story maps reviewed with stakeholders
  - [ ] Customer journey accuracy validated with user research
  - [ ] Business value alignment confirmed with stakeholders
  - [ ] Technical feasibility reviewed with development team
  - [ ] Release planning validated against business objectives

- [ ] **Story Quality**: Individual stories meet INVEST criteria
  - [ ] Stories are independent where possible
  - [ ] Story details are negotiable and refinable
  - [ ] Business value is clear and measurable
  - [ ] Stories are estimable by development team
  - [ ] Story scope is appropriately sized
  - [ ] Acceptance criteria make stories testable

## Documentation Requirements

- **REQ-MAP-ARTIFACTS**: All story maps documented in accessible format
- **REQ-RELEASE-PLANNING**: Release plan with clear boundaries and success criteria
- **REQ-STORY-STANDARDS**: Story writing and management standards documented
- **REQ-VALIDATION-PROCESS**: Map validation and iteration process established

## Dependencies

- **000.0-PO-STARTUP-MACHINE**: Strategic analysis provides foundation for mapping decisions
- **001.0-PO-STORY-MANAGEMENT**: Story management framework supports ongoing map maintenance

## Integration Requirements

- **Business Strategy Alignment**: Maps reflect startup machine analysis insights
- **Development Process Integration**: Maps inform and align with development workflow
- **Analytics Integration**: Success metrics align with planned analytics implementation
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Maps serve as communication tool for alignment

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Business user story map completed and validated
- [ ] Product owner process map completed and documented
- [ ] Release planning completed with clear boundaries and success criteria
- [ ] Story identification completed with dependency mapping
- [ ] Maps reviewed and approved by key stakeholders
- [ ] Story management process established to maintain maps
- [ ] Maps inform development prioritization and planning decisions

## Notes

This story mapping should leverage:

- Jeff Patton's User Story Mapping methodology
- Design thinking principles for customer empathy
- Lean startup principles for hypothesis-driven development
- Agile release planning techniques
- Customer journey mapping best practices

The output should directly inform story management (001.0) and guide all subsequent development activities.
