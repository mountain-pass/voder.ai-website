# PO-STORY-MANAGEMENT: User Story Management Framework

## Release Goal

_"Release 0.5: Essential Development Foundation - Establish systematic story management for organized development workflow"_

Create a comprehensive user story management system using Jeff Patton user story mapping methodology with INVEST criteria, enabling systematic development planning, dependency tracking, and release management for the voder.ai website project.

## How This Story Contributes

This foundational meta-story establishes the framework for all subsequent story management, ensuring development proceeds in logical dependency order with clear value delivery. Without systematic story management, development becomes chaotic and dependencies create blocking issues.

**Note: This is a process-only meta-story that requires no code implementation. The "implementation" consists entirely of creating documentation, templates, and establishing workflow guidelines.**

## User Story

So that I can ensure stories are implemented in the correct order and track dependencies effectively, as a product owner, I want user stories to have numbered prefixes that indicate implementation order and clear dependency documentation.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Story management can be established independently
- **Negotiable**: Template format and numbering system can be refined
- **Valuable**: Provides systematic development planning framework
- **Estimable**: Clear scope for establishing documentation system
- **Small**: Can be completed through documentation and template creation
- **Testable**: Success measured by consistent story format and dependency tracking

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Story Template**: Comprehensive story template created in prompt-assets/story-template.md
- [ ] **Numbering System**: All stories have numeric prefixes indicating implementation order (001, 002, etc.)
- [ ] **Dependency Tracking**: Dependencies are clearly documented in each story
- [ ] **INVEST Compliance**: All stories follow INVEST criteria format
- [ ] **User Story Format**: Stories use "So that {VALUE}, as a {PERSONA}, I want {FEATURE}" format
- [ ] **Release Structure**: Clear separation between in-scope and backlog stories
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complete methodology documented for team reference
- [ ] **Dependency Validation**: Story numbers are greater than all dependency numbers
- [ ] **Template Usage**: All existing stories follow the established template format

## ðŸš« Protected Documentation Directory

### Documentation Protection Policy (Critical)

**The `prompts/` and `prompt-assets/` directories and ALL their contents are PROTECTED from edits and additions during implementation.**

- **NEVER edit, modify, or add files** in `/prompts/` or `/prompt-assets/` directories during development
- **NEVER create new files** in `/prompts/`, `/prompt-assets/`, or any of their subdirectories
- **NEVER modify existing files** in these directories including requirements, user stories, documentation, or legacy baselines
- The `prompts/` directory contains the **authoritative project specifications** and must remain unchanged
- The `prompt-assets/` directory contains **protected reference materials and legacy baselines** that must remain unchanged
- **Contents of `prompt-assets/` MUST NOT affect code quality assessments** - it contains intentional reference duplicates that should be ignored during evaluation
- All implementation work must occur in `src/`, `tests/`, and other appropriate directories
- If specifications need clarification, stop work and request clarification rather than modifying these protected directories

**HOWEVER: If external edits to `prompts/` or `prompt-assets/` already exist (created by humans), voder MUST commit those changes BEFORE proceeding with any other work.**

- **FR0.1.1**: Check git status for uncommitted changes in `prompts/` and `prompt-assets/` directories
- **FR0.1.2**: If changes exist, commit them immediately with descriptive message before starting implementation work
- **FR0.1.3**: This ensures external specification updates are preserved in version control
- **FR0.1.4**: After committing external changes, resume normal development workflow

**Violation of this policy invalidates the autonomous development approach and compromises project integrity.**

### Assessment Exclusion Policy (Universal Standard)

**Contents of `prompt-assets/` directory MUST be excluded from all code quality and duplication assessments.**

- **Legacy baselines and reference materials** in `prompt-assets/` are intentionally preserved for comparison purposes
- **Apparent duplication** between `prompt-assets/` content and project files is expected and should be ignored
- **Quality assessments** must focus only on `src/`, `tests/`, configuration files, and documentation in the project root
- **Code quality scores** must not be penalized for reference materials in `prompt-assets/`
- The `prompt-assets/legacy-voder-baseline/` contains a complete reference project that will naturally duplicate many patterns found in the main project

This ensures accurate assessment of the actual implementation quality without contamination from protected reference materials.

### Autonomous Development Standards (Universal Standard)

**All implementation work must follow autonomous development principles for maximum velocity.**

- **REQ-REAL-API-CALLS**: MUST make real OpenAI API calls (no conservative fallbacks that prevent actual work)
- **REQ-APPLY-CHANGES**: MUST apply code changes to implement specifications (no dry-run-only modes that prevent progress)
- **REQ-COMMIT-PUSH**: MUST commit and push changes when implementation matches specifications (no manual approval gates that slow development)
- **REQ-CREATE-SOFTWARE**: System MUST be designed to create real software, not simulations or demonstrations
- **REQ-CO-LOCATED-TESTING**: MUST use co-located testing pattern for optimal autonomous code comprehension and maintenance

These standards ensure development proceeds efficiently without artificial barriers or approval gates that compromise velocity.

### Startup Engine Integration

Following startup engine methodology for assumption testing:

- **Primary Risk**: Can we articulate AI slop problem that founders recognize?
- **Validation Method**: LinkedIn post testing for message resonance
- **Success Metrics**: >70% "This is exactly my problem" responses
- **Testing Strategy**: Problem validation before solution development

### Quality Standards

- **Template Compliance**: All stories must follow prompt-assets/story-template.md
- **Dependency Validation**: Automated checking that story numbers > dependency numbers
- **INVEST Review**: Regular review of stories against INVEST criteria
- **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Dependencies must reference valid, existing stories

## Implementation Guidelines

### Creating New Stories

1. **For stories at end of sequence**: Use next sequential number (XXX.0 format)
2. **For stories inserted between existing stories**: Use decimal numbering (XXX.Y format where Y increments: .1, .2, .3, etc.)
3. **CRITICAL**: Every story MUST have a unique number - verify no conflicts before creating
4. Follow prompt-assets/story-template.md structure
5. Ensure story number > all dependency numbers
6. Include clear value proposition in user story format
7. Define testable acceptance criteria
8. Document technical requirements with REQ-/IMPL- prefixes
9. **ALWAYS update corresponding user story maps** after adding/modifying stories

### Decimal Numbering Examples

- **End insertion**: 012.0 â†’ 013.0 (next major number)
- **Between insertion**: 012.0, 013.0 â†’ insert 012.1 between them
- **Multiple insertions**: 012.0 â†’ 012.1 â†’ 012.2 â†’ 012.3 â†’ 013.0
- **Never duplicate**: 012.1 exists â†’ next insertion is 012.2, not another 012.1

### Managing Dependencies

1. List dependencies with numbered story references
2. Include explanation for each dependency relationship
3. Validate no circular dependencies exist
4. Minimize cross-release dependencies
5. Update dependencies when stories are renumbered

### Release Planning Process

1. Start with user story mapping for journey phases
2. Identify minimum viable stories for release goal
3. Validate dependency chains don't create blocks
4. Sequence stories respecting dependency order
5. Document release boundaries and scope
