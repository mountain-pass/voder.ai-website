# PO-DECISION-MANAGEMENT: Architecture Decision Records Management

## Release Goal

_"Future Release: Decision Management - Establish systematic architecture decision tracking and standards cultivation system"_

Create a comprehensive architecture decision records (ADR) management system using MADR 4.0 format and standards cultivation principles, enabling systematic decision tracking, duplicate cleanup, healthy standards evolution, and experimentation-driven architectural improvement for the voder.ai website project.

## How This Story Contributes

This story enables product owners and developers to cultivate healthy architectural standards through experimentation rather than subjective review, track decisions systematically, avoid decision duplication, maintain decision history, and ensure all technical choices evolve based on production track records and team feedback.

**Note: This is a process-only meta-story that requires no code implementation. The "implementation" consists entirely of establishing documentation standards, workflow guidelines, and process definitions.**

## User Story

So that I can cultivate healthy architectural standards through experimentation and systematic tracking rather than subjective review processes, as a product owner, I want a well-organized ADR system that follows MADR 4.0 format with standards cultivation principles, encouraging proposals and exemptions while maintaining production-validated standards.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Decision management can be established independently
- **Negotiable**: ADR format and cultivation approach can be refined
- **Valuable**: Provides systematic standards cultivation and team knowledge sharing
- **Estimable**: Clear scope for establishing decision cultivation system
- **Small**: Can be completed through documentation organization and process setup
- **Testable**: Success measured by consistent ADR format, no duplicates, and healthy standards evolution

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **Duplicate Cleanup**: All duplicate ADR files removed from docs/decisions/
- [x] **Sequential Numbering**: All decisions have unique, sequential numbers (0000-0023)
- [x] **Filename Standards**: All decisions follow `<ID>-<kebab-case-title>.<status>.md` format
- [x] **MADR 4.0 Format**: All decisions follow [MADR 4.0 template structure](../../../prompt-assets/adr-template.md)
- [x] **Decision Status**: Each decision has clear status (proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded)
- [x] **Standards Cultivation Process**: Document standards cultivation approach focusing on:
  - Open proposal system (anyone can propose)
  - Non-subjective, easy-to-follow standards
  - Production track record validation
  - Exemption encouragement as experiments
  - No retrospective application
  - Regular review and deprecation cycles
- [x] **Template Reference**: ADR template available in prompt-assets/ for consistency
- [x] **Exemption Tracking**: Process for tracking exemptions as experiments
- [x] **Standards Review Cycle**: Regular review process for standards deprecation and endorsement
- [x] **Cleanup Documentation**: Process documented for preventing future duplicates
- [x] **Status Tracking**: Process for updating decision status over time

## Requirements

### Standards Cultivation Philosophy

- **REQ-CULTIVATOR-MINDSET**: Focus on health of standards system and quality of standards produced, not traditional architectural review
- **REQ-INNOVATION-BALANCE**: Balance innovation and standardization - encourage experiments while maintaining useful standards
- **REQ-PRODUCTION-VALIDATION**: Only endorse standards with positive production track record
- **REQ-EXEMPTION-ENCOURAGEMENT**: Actively encourage exemptions as experiments to improve standards

### Standards Proposal and Lifecycle

- **REQ-OPEN-PROPOSALS**: Anyone can propose standards without subjective review barriers
- **REQ-STANDARD-QUALITIES**: Standards must be:
  - Non-subjective and measurable
  - Easy to follow and implement
  - Succinctly summarized in title (e.g., "Use JSON in REST API responses")
  - Include options considered and rationale for choice
  - List existing standards it will supersede
  - Include reassessment criteria for future review
- **REQ-NO-DECLINE-POLICY**: Don't decline standards - help resubmit if they don't meet criteria
- **REQ-ENDORSEMENT-CRITERIA**: Only endorse standards with positive production implementation track record
- **REQ-DEPRECATION-PROCESS**: When endorsing standards, supersede the standards they replace

### Standards Application Rules

- **REQ-NO-RETROSPECTIVE**: Standards not applied retrospectively - no forced compliance for existing systems
- **REQ-ENDORSED-COMPLIANCE**: Projects MUST follow endorsed standards unless exempted
- **REQ-PROPOSED-COMPLIANCE**: Projects MUST follow proposed standards unless:
  - Competing proposed standard exists they can follow
  - Board grants exemption
  - They submit competing proposed standard
- **REQ-DEPRECATED-PROHIBITION**: Teams must NOT use deprecated standards for new implementations unless exempted

### Exemption and Experimentation Framework

- **REQ-EXEMPTION-CRITERIA**: Grant exemptions when developers have:
  - Non-trivial reason for exemption
  - Commitment to document experiment results
  - Agreement to propose new standard if experiment succeeds
- **REQ-EXPERIMENT-TRACKING**: All exemptions tracked as experiments in an "exemptions" section within the corresponding decision
- **REQ-EXPERIMENT-FEEDBACK**: Developers must document experiment outcomes in the decision's exemptions section

### Standards Maintenance and Evolution

- **REQ-CONTEXTUAL-REVIEW**: Review standards when creating related decisions, updating dependencies, or encountering conflicts
- **REQ-USAGE-ASSESSMENT**: Promote standards with positive production usage; flag unused standards for deprecation
- **REQ-EXEMPTION-DRIVEN-REVIEW**: Automatically review standards when exemption count exceeds threshold (3+ exemptions)
- **REQ-TRACK-RECORD-FOCUS**: Standards thrive based on positive production track record only

### ADR Management System

- **REQ-MADR-FORMAT**: All decisions use [MADR 4.0 Architecture Decision Record format](../../../prompt-assets/adr-template.md)
- **REQ-SEQUENTIAL-NUMBERS**: Decisions numbered sequentially without gaps or duplicates
- **REQ-UNIQUE-NAMING**: Each decision has unique number and descriptive title
- **REQ-STATUS-TRACKING**: Clear status field (proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded)
- **REQ-TEMPLATE-CONSISTENCY**: All decisions follow consistent template structure
- **REQ-DECISION-FILENAME-FORMAT**: Decision files follow `<ID>-<kebab-case-title>.<status>.md` format (e.g., `0015-require-peer-dependencies-for-consumer-tools.accepted.md`)

### Duplicate Prevention

- **REQ-NUMBER-VALIDATION**: Process to ensure no duplicate decision numbers
- **REQ-TOPIC-VALIDATION**: Check for decisions covering same architectural area
- **REQ-REVIEW-PROCESS**: New decisions reviewed against existing decisions
- **REQ-CLEANUP-DOCUMENTATION**: Clear process for removing outdated decisions

### Decision Documentation Standards

- **REQ-CONTEXT-DOCUMENTATION**: Each decision includes problem statement and context
- **REQ-OPTION-ANALYSIS**: Multiple options considered with pros/cons
- **REQ-RATIONALE-CLEAR**: Clear explanation of why decision was made
- **REQ-CONSEQUENCES-DOCUMENTED**: Positive and negative consequences identified
- **REQ-CONFIRMATION-CRITERIA**: How compliance with decision will be verified
- **REQ-TIMELESS-CONTENT**: Decisions must be timeless and MUST NOT refer to current state, using principle-based language that remains valid over time
- **REQ-ARCHITECTURAL-FOCUS**: Decisions must address "how to do work" (architectural principles, technology choices, standards) not "what work to do" (tasks, cleanup activities, implementation plans)

### Integration with Story Management

- **REQ-STORY-DECISION-LINK**: Stories reference relevant architectural decisions
- **REQ-DECISION-STORY-LINK**: Decisions link to implementing stories when applicable
- **REQ-CROSS-REFERENCE**: Easy navigation between stories and decisions
- **REQ-UPDATE-PROCESS**: Process for updating decisions when stories change requirements

## Dependencies

- 001.0-PO-STORY-MANAGEMENT (requires story management framework for decision integration)
