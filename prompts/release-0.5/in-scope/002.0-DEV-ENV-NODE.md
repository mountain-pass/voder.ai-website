# DEV-ENV-NODE: Node.js Environment Setup

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Provide immediate feedback loops for code quality through comprehensive linting and testing tools that catch issues during development, ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the AI slop problem validation website.

## How This Story Contributes

This story ensures consistent development environment setup by specifying Node.js requirements and providing clear setup instructions, preventing environment-related issues and enabling smooth onboarding for new developers.

## User Story

So that I can set up a consistent development environment and avoid Node.js version conflicts, as a frontend developer, I want clear Node.js requirements and setup instructions that ensure my local environment matches the project's needs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- package.json specifies exact Node.js version requirement (engines field)
- README documents Node.js setup requirements and recommended version manager
- Setup instructions include recommended Node.js installation method
- Setup process is clearly documented with step-by-step instructions

## Requirements

### Node.js Environment Setup

- **REQ-NODE-VERSION**: Node.js >=22.17.0 requirement in package.json engines
- **REQ-SETUP-DOCS**: Clear setup instructions in README.md
- **REQ-VERSION-MANAGER**: Recommendation for Node.js version manager (nvm/fnm)

## Dependencies

- None (foundational requirement for all other development)
