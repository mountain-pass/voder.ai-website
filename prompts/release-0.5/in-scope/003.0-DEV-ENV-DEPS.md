# DEV-ENV-DEPS: Package Installation and Dependency Management

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Provide immediate feedback loops for code quality through comprehensive linting and testing tools that catch issues during development, ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the AI slop problem validation website.

## How This Story Contributes

This story ensures reliable and fast dependency installation with clear instructions, preventing package-related issues and providing consistent development environment setup across different machines and developers.

## User Story

So that I can quickly install project dependencies and avoid package-related issues, as a frontend developer, I want clear dependency installation instructions and reliable package management that works consistently across environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `npm install` completes successfully without errors
- package-lock.json is committed and ensures reproducible installs
- README documents dependency installation process clearly
- Development commands work immediately after fresh install
- Clear error messages if installation fails
- No warnings about deprecated or vulnerable packages
- **Verification pipeline** established with correct order: audit fix → lint fix → lint check → format → build → test
- **Console-first diagnostics** implemented for all development tooling output

## Requirements

### Core Dependency Management

- **REQ-INSTALL-DOCS**: Clear npm install instructions in README.md
- **REQ-LOCKFILE**: Committed package-lock.json for reproducible builds
- **REQ-INSTALL-SCRIPT**: Optional install script for complete setup
- **REQ-HEALTH-CHECK**: Script to verify successful installation

### Quality Assurance Pipeline

- **REQ-VERIFICATION-ORDER**: Mandatory verification order: audit fix → lint fix → lint check → format → build → test
- **REQ-CONSOLE-DIAGNOSTICS**: Console-first diagnostics policy for development tooling output (linters, scripts, generators)
- **REQ-VERIFY-COMMAND**: `npm run verify` script runs complete pipeline and must pass before every commit

### Development Environment Standards

- **REQ-POSIX-ONLY**: All development scripts and tooling must work in POSIX-compliant environments
- **REQ-VODER-TRACKED**: `.voder` directory MUST be tracked in version control
- **REQ-PROPER-GITIGNORE**: Development artifacts must be properly gitignored
- **REQ-OS-TEMP-DIRS**: Temporary files must use OS temporary directories, not project directories

### Licensing and Repository Policy

- **REQ-UNLICENSED**: Software license MUST be UNLICENSED (all rights reserved)
- **REQ-PACKAGE-LICENSE**: package.json MUST specify `"license": "UNLICENSED"`
- **REQ-LICENSE-FILE**: LICENSE file MUST contain "All Rights Reserved" statement
- **REQ-NO-OPEN-SOURCE**: No open source or permissive licensing is permitted

## Dependencies

- 002.0-DEV-ENV-NODE (requires Node.js environment before installing dependencies)
