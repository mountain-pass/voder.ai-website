# DEV-BUILD-VITE: Vite Development and Build System

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Provide immediate feedback loops for code quality through comprehensive linting and testing tools that catch issues during development, ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the vite rot problem validation website.

## How This Story Contributes

This story provides fast development server with hot module replacement and optimized production builds, enabling rapid development cycles with immediate visual feedback and efficient deployment-ready outputs.

## User Story

So that I can develop rapidly with immediate visual feedback and deploy optimized production builds, as a frontend developer, I want a modern build system that provides fast hot reload during development and creates efficient bundles for production.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `npm run dev` starts development server with hot module replacement successfully
- `npm run build` creates optimized production bundle successfully
- `npm run preview` serves production build for local testing
- Development server provides immediate feedback on code changes
- Production build optimizes assets (minification, code splitting, compression)
- Build process integrates with TypeScript compilation

## Requirements

- **IMPL-VITE**: Vite v7.1+ as build tool and development server
- **IMPL-HMR**: Hot module replacement for immediate feedback
- **IMPL-TS-INTEGRATION**: Native TypeScript support in Vite
- **IMPL-NPM-SCRIPTS**: dev, build, preview scripts in package.json
- **IMPL-CONFIG**: vite.config.ts configuration file

## Dependencies

- 001.0-PO-STORY-MANAGEMENT (requires story tracking framework)
- 004.0-DEV-TYPESCRIPT (build system must work with TypeScript)
- 002.0-DEV-ENV-NODE (requires Node.js environment for Vite)
- 003.0-DEV-ENV-DEPS (requires npm dependencies for Vite packages)
