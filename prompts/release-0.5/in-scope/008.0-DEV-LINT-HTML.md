# DEV-LINT-HTML: HTML Markup Val## Dependencies

- 001.0-PO-STORY-MANAGEMENT (requires story tracking framework)
- 004.0-DEV-TYPESCRIPT (HTML linting in TypeScript build process)
- 002.0-DEV-ENV-NODE (requires Node.js environment for htmlhint)
- 003.0-DEV-ENV-DEPS (requires npm dependencies for htmlhint packages)tion and Quality

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Provide immediate feedback loops for code quality through comprehensive linting and testing tools that catch issues during development, ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the AI slop problem validation website.

## How This Story Contributes

This story enables developers to catch HTML markup errors, accessibility issues, and best practice violations immediately, ensuring semantic, accessible, and well-formed HTML throughout development.

## User Story

So that I can ensure valid, semantic HTML markup and catch accessibility issues early, as a frontend developer, I want automated HTML linting that validates markup structure and reports errors with clear, actionable feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

- HTMLHint successfully validates all .html files in the project
- Linting catches common HTML errors (unclosed tags, invalid attributes, etc.)
- `npm run lint:html` command executes successfully with clear error reports
- Configuration excludes generated files (coverage/, dist/, build/, packages/, apps/)
- Linting focuses only on project HTML files, not generated content
- Zero false positives on correctly written HTML markup

## Requirements

- **IMPL-HTMLHINT**: HTMLHint v1.6+ for HTML validation
- **IMPL-IGNORE-PATTERNS**: Comprehensive ignore patterns for generated directories
- **IMPL-NPM-SCRIPT**: npm run lint:html script with proper file targeting
- **IMPL-PROJECT-SCOPE**: Linting scoped to project HTML files only (not generated content)

## Dependencies

- None (independent HTML validation capability)
