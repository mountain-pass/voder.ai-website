- 002.0-DEV-ENV-NODE (requires Node.js environment for markdownlint)
- 003.0-DEV-ENV-DEPS (requires npm dependencies for markdownlint packages)on Quality Linting

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Provide immediate feedback loops for code quality through comprehensive linting and testing tools that catch issues during development, ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the vibe rot problem validation website.

## How This Story Contributes

This story ensures documentation quality by automatically validating markdown files for consistency, format errors, and best practices, maintaining professional documentation standards across all project documentation.

## User Story

So that I can maintain consistent, high-quality documentation and catch markdown formatting issues immediately, as a frontend developer, I want automated markdown linting that validates documentation format and reports errors with clear, actionable feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

- markdownlint-cli2 successfully validates all markdown files in the project
- Linting catches format errors (heading structure, link validity, list formatting)
- `npm run lint:md` command executes successfully with clear error reports
- `npm run lint:md:fix` command automatically fixes auto-fixable issues
- Configuration targets project documentation (README.md, docs/**, specs/**)
- Zero false positives on correctly formatted markdown

## Requirements

- **IMPL-MARKDOWNLINT**: markdownlint-cli2 v0.18+ for markdown validation
- **IMPL-CONFIG-FILE**: .markdownlint.json configuration file with project rules
- **IMPL-NPM-SCRIPTS**: npm run lint:md and lint:md:fix scripts
- **IMPL-FILE-TARGETING**: Targeted linting of README.md, docs/**, specs/** directories

## Dependencies

- None (independent markdown validation capability)
