# DEV-LINT-JS: JavaScript/TypeScript Code Quality Linting

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Provide immediate feedback loops for code quality through comprehensive linting and testing tools that catch issues during development, ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the AI slop problem validation website.

## How This Story Contributes

This story enables developers to receive immediate feedback about JavaScript and TypeScript code quality issues (syntax errors, style violations, import problems, etc.) as they write code, preventing bugs and maintaining consistent code quality throughout development.

## User Story

So that I can catch code quality issues immediately and maintain consistent JavaScript/TypeScript code standards, as a frontend developer, I want automated linting that runs during development and reports errors with clear, actionable feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria

- ESLint v9 flat configuration successfully lints all .js, .ts, .jsx, .tsx files
- Linting includes TypeScript-specific rules, import sorting, and code quality rules
- `npm run lint` command executes successfully with clear error/warning reports
- `npm run lint:fix` command automatically fixes auto-fixable issues
- Linting integrates with development workflow (runs on file save in IDE)
- Configuration excludes generated files (dist/, coverage/, node_modules/)
- Zero false positives on correctly written code

## Requirements

- **IMPL-ESLINT-V9**: ESLint v9 flat configuration in eslint.config.ts
- **IMPL-TS-PLUGIN**: @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin and parser for TypeScript support
- **IMPL-IMPORT-SORT**: eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort for consistent imports
- **IMPL-UNICORN**: eslint-plugin-unicorn for additional code quality rules
- **IMPL-PRETTIER-INT**: eslint-config-prettier to prevent conflicts with Prettier
- **IMPL-NPM-SCRIPTS**: npm run lint and npm run lint:fix scripts in package.json

## Dependencies

- 001.0-PO-STORY-MANAGEMENT (requires story tracking framework)
- 004.0-DEV-TYPESCRIPT (TypeScript support required for ESLint TypeScript rules)
- 006.0-DEV-FORMAT (Prettier integration to avoid formatting conflicts)
- 002.0-DEV-ENV-NODE (requires Node.js environment for ESLint)
- 003.0-DEV-ENV-DEPS (requires npm dependencies for ESLint packages)
