# DEV-TEST-UNIT: Unit Testing Framework

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Provide immediate feedback loops for code quality through comprehensive linting and testing tools that catch issues during development, ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the vibe rot problem validation website.

## How This Story Contributes

This story enables developers to validate code logic through automated unit tests, catch regressions early, and ensure code reliability through comprehensive testing infrastructure that provides immediate feedback on code correctness.

## User Story

So that I can validate code logic and catch regressions immediately through automated testing, as a frontend developer, I want a comprehensive unit testing framework that runs quickly and provides clear feedback about code correctness.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Vitest successfully runs unit tests with jsdom environment for DOM testing
- `npm run test` command executes all tests with clear pass/fail reporting
- `npm run test:watch` command provides continuous testing during development
- `npm run test:ci` command runs tests suitable for CI environment
- Testing framework supports TypeScript without additional configuration
- Tests run successfully with clear pass/fail output
- **Co-located testing pattern implemented** (test files next to source files)
- **Test discovery configured** to find co-located tests using glob patterns
- **Build configuration excludes** test files from compilation output
- **Test file system hygiene** enforced (no files created in local repository unless gitignored)
- **OS temporary directory APIs** used for all temporary file operations in tests
- **Test cleanup** ensures all temporary files and directories are removed after tests
- **Test script behavior** follows standardized patterns (exit after run, watch mode available)

## Requirements

### Core Testing Framework

- **IMPL-VITEST**: Vitest v3.2+ as the testing framework
- **IMPL-JSDOM**: jsdom v26+ for DOM testing environment
- **IMPL-TS-SUPPORT**: Native TypeScript support in Vitest
- **IMPL-NPM-SCRIPTS**: test, test:watch, test:ci scripts in package.json
- **IMPL-CONFIG**: vitest.config.ts configuration file

### Co-Located Testing Pattern (Universal Standard)

- **REQ-COLOCATED-PATTERN**: MUST use co-located testing pattern (e.g., `foo.ts` and `foo.test.ts` in same directory)
- **REQ-COLOCATED-DISCOVERY**: Test discovery MUST use glob patterns that find co-located tests (e.g., `**/*.test.{ts,js}`)
- **REQ-BUILD-EXCLUDE**: Build configuration MUST exclude test files from compilation output (e.g., `exclude: ["**/*.test.ts"]` in tsconfig.json)
- **REQ-INTEGRATION-ISOLATION**: Integration tests requiring complete isolation MUST still be placed in `tests/integration/` directory for safety
- **REQ-AUTONOMOUS-CONTEXT**: Co-location improves autonomous development by providing immediate test context when analyzing modules

### Test File System Hygiene (Universal Standard)

- **REQ-NO-LOCAL-FILES**: Tests MUST NOT create files in the local repository unless they are explicitly gitignored
- **REQ-TEMP-DIRECTORY**: Use OS temporary directory APIs (e.g., `os.tmpdir()`, `fs.mkdtemp()`) for all temporary file operations
- **REQ-TEST-CLEANUP**: Tests MUST clean up after themselves - all temporary files and directories must be removed
- **REQ-SIMPLE-FIXTURES**: Use simple sample projects as fixtures rather than generating complex test data

### Test Script Standards (Universal Standard)

- **REQ-TEST-EXIT**: `npm run test` MUST exit after running tests (e.g., `vitest --run`)
- **REQ-TEST-WATCH**: `npm run test:watch` MUST provide watch mode for development (e.g., `vitest --watch`)
- **REQ-NO-HANG**: Test script MUST NOT hang or wait indefinitely in CI/automation contexts
- **REQ-WATCH-DEVELOPMENT**: Watch mode enables iterative development while run mode enables pipeline integration
- **REQ-PIPELINE-RELIABILITY**: Exit behavior ensures reliable completion in automated verification workflows
