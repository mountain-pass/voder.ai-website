# DEV-TEST-COVERAGE: Test Coverage Reporting

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Provide immediate feedback loops for code quality through comprehensive linting and testing tools that catch issues during development, ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the vibe rot problem validation website.

## How This Story Contributes

This story provides visibility into test completeness by measuring code coverage, helping developers identify untested code paths and maintain confidence in code reliability through comprehensive coverage reporting.

## User Story

So that I can ensure comprehensive test coverage and identify untested code paths, as a frontend developer, I want automated coverage reporting that shows exactly which parts of my code are tested and provides clear metrics about test completeness.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Coverage reporting successfully measures line, branch, function, and statement coverage
- `npm run test:coverage` command generates comprehensive coverage reports
- Coverage reports exclude generated files and focus on source code
- Coverage data is available in multiple formats (terminal summary, HTML reports)
- Coverage thresholds can be configured and enforced
- Coverage reports are generated successfully with accurate metrics

## Requirements

- **IMPL-VITEST-COVERAGE**: @vitest/coverage-v8 for coverage collection
- **IMPL-NPM-SCRIPT**: npm run test:coverage script
- **IMPL-COVERAGE-CONFIG**: Coverage configuration in vitest.config.ts
- **IMPL-MULTIPLE-FORMATS**: Support for terminal and HTML coverage reports

## Dependencies
