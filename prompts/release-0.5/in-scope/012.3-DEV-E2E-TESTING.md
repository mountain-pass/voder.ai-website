# DEV-E2E-TESTING: Playwright End-to-End Testing Framework

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Implement Playwright end-to-end testing framework for automated functional testing of the web application, providing comprehensive test coverage for user workflows, interactions, and application behavior.

## How This Story Contributes

This story establishes the fundamental E2E testing infrastructure that enables automated functional validation, user workflow testing, and integration testing. It provides the foundation for advanced testing capabilities like visual regression and production verification.

## User Story

So that I can automatically validate the functionality and user workflows of the web application, as a developer, I want Playwright E2E tests that verify key user interactions and application behavior so I can catch functional regressions and ensure quality before deployment.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: E2E testing can be implemented independently after unit testing foundation
- **Negotiable**: Test scenarios and configuration can be refined
- **Valuable**: Provides automated functional validation and regression testing
- **Estimable**: Clear scope for implementing basic Playwright E2E testing
- **Small**: Can be completed by setting up Playwright and fundamental test cases
- **Testable**: Success measured by working E2E tests covering key functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Playwright Installation**: Playwright installed and configured as dev dependency
- [ ] **Playwright Configuration**: playwright.config.ts configured for testing
- [ ] **Test Structure**: tests/e2e/ directory with organized test files
- [ ] **Basic Test Coverage**: E2E tests covering:
  - Page loading and rendering
  - Navigation functionality
  - Key user interactions
  - Form submissions (if applicable)
  - Console error detection and validation
  - Error handling scenarios
- [ ] **npm Scripts**: Package.json scripts for running E2E tests
- [ ] **CI Integration**: Tests run in headless mode for continuous integration
- [ ] **Cross-Browser Testing**: Tests run on Chromium (primary browser)
- [ ] **Test Reporting**: Clear test results and failure reporting
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Basic performance validation during tests

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Playwright Configuration Example

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests/e2e',
  fullyParallel: true,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: 'html',
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:4173',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
  ],
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run preview',
    url: 'http://localhost:4173',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
});
```

### Package.json Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "e2e": "playwright test",
    "e2e:ci": "playwright test --reporter=list",
    "e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed",
    "e2e:install": "playwright install"
  }
}
```

### Basic E2E Test Example

```typescript
// tests/e2e/app.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Application Functionality', () => {
  test('homepage loads correctly', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/');

    // Verify page loads
    await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Voder/);

    // Check for key elements
    await expect(page.locator('h1')).toBeVisible();

    // Verify no console errors
    const errors: string[] = [];
    page.on('console', (msg) => {
      if (msg.type() === 'error') {
        errors.push(msg.text());
      }
    });

    await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
    expect(errors).toHaveLength(0);
  });

  test('navigation works correctly', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/');

    // Test navigation interactions
    // Add specific navigation tests based on application structure
  });
});
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/e2e.yml
- name: Run Playwright tests
  run: npm run e2e:ci

- name: Upload test results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  if: failure()
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: playwright-report/
```
