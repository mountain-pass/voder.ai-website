# BRAND-1: Minimal Brand Identity Landing

## Release Goal

_"Test if ONE AI slop description resonates strongly with founders"_

Release 0.5 is the absolute minimum test of our riskiest assumption: can we articulate the AI slop problem in a way that founders immediately recognize as their exact problem? This release focuses purely on message validation before investing in larger development efforts.

## How This Story Contributes

This story establishes the minimal credible context needed for founders to take the AI slop message seriously. Without basic brand identity, the message could be dismissed as unprofessional or untrustworthy, invalidating our test results.

## User Story

So that I can trust the message I'm about to read, as a founder evaluating new development approaches, I want to see professional brand presentation that signals this is a legitimate company with serious solutions.
