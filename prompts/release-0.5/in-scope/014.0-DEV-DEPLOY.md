# DEV-DEPLOY: Static Site Deployment

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Get the AI slop validation site live for founder testing"_

Deploy the brand entry website to a publicly accessible URL so founders can visit it and we can track their engagement with the AI slop problem description.

## How This Story Contributes

This story enables the core validation experiment by making the website accessible to founders. Without deployment, we cannot test message resonance or track visitor behavior that validates our riskiest assumptions.

## User Story

So that I can share the AI slop validation site with founders and track their responses, as a product owner, I want the website deployed to a public URL that loads quickly and reliably for all visitors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Website deployed to public URL (e.g., voder.ai or subdomain)
- [ ] Deployment updates automatically when main branch changes
- [ ] Site loads in under 2 seconds from any location
- [ ] SSL certificate configured (HTTPS)
- [ ] Custom domain configured (not generic hosting domain)
- [ ] Error pages (404) handle gracefully
- [ ] Deployment status is visible to development team

## Requirements (to be implemented)

- **REQ-STATIC-HOST**: Static hosting platform (Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages)
- **REQ-AUTO-DEPLOY**: Automatic deployment from git main branch
- **REQ-CUSTOM-DOMAIN**: Custom domain configuration
- **REQ-SSL-CERT**: SSL certificate for HTTPS
- **REQ-DEPLOY-STATUS**: Deployment status monitoring and notifications

## Dependencies

- 001.0-PO-STORY-MANAGEMENT (requires story tracking framework)
- 005.0-DEV-BUILD-VITE (requires production build system)
- 013.0-BIZ-BRAND-ENTRY (requires completed website to deploy)
