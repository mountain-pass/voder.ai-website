# DEV-DEPLOY: Static Site Deployment

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Get the AI slop validation site live for founder testing"_

Deploy the brand entry website to a publicly accessible URL so founders can visit it and we can track their engagement with the AI slop problem description.

## How This Story Contributes

This story enables the core validation experiment by making the website accessible to founders. Without deployment, we cannot test message resonance or track visitor behavior that validates our riskiest assumptions.

## User Story

So that I can share the AI slop validation site with founders and track their responses, as a product owner, I want the website deployed to a public URL that loads quickly and reliably for all visitors.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Note**: This story establishes basic deployment capability. Quality gates and deployment protection are handled in story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION, which disables Vercel's automatic deployment and uses GitHub Actions for controlled deployment.

- [ ] Website deployed to public URL (e.g., voder.ai or subdomain)
- [ ] Deployment updates automatically when main branch changes (OR controlled via GitHub Actions for quality protection)
- [ ] Site loads in under 2 seconds from any location
- [ ] SSL certificate configured (HTTPS)
- [ ] Custom domain configured (not generic hosting domain)
- [ ] Error pages (404) handle gracefully
- [ ] Deployment status is visible to development team

## Requirements (to be implemented)

**Important**: Per [Vercel's documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/git/vercel-for-github), "Vercel for GitHub will deploy every push by default." This story establishes basic deployment, while story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION modifies this behavior for quality control.

- **REQ-STATIC-HOST**: Static hosting platform (Vercel recommended for GitHub integration)
- **REQ-AUTO-DEPLOY**: Automatic deployment from git main branch (default Vercel behavior)
- **REQ-CUSTOM-DOMAIN**: Custom domain configuration (voder.ai)
- **REQ-SSL-CERT**: SSL certificate for HTTPS (automatic with Vercel)
- **REQ-DEPLOY-STATUS**: Deployment status monitoring and notifications
- **REQ-PERFORMANCE**: Site loads in under 2 seconds globally
- **REQ-ERROR-HANDLING**: Graceful 404 and error page handling

**Deployment Protection Note**: Quality gates and deployment blocking are implemented in 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION through GitHub Actions controlled deployment.

## Dependencies

- 001.0-PO-STORY-MANAGEMENT (requires story tracking framework)
- 005.0-DEV-BUILD-VITE (requires production build system)
- 013.0-BIZ-BRAND-ENTRY (requires completed website to deploy)

## Implementation Notes

### Vercel Automatic Deployment

By default, [Vercel for GitHub](https://vercel.com/docs/git/vercel-for-github) provides:

- **Automatic deployments** on every push to any branch
- **Preview URLs** for pull requests
- **Production deployments** for pushes to main branch
- **SSL certificates** automatically managed
- **Custom domain** configuration through Vercel dashboard

### Quality Protection Integration

This story establishes the basic deployment infrastructure. Story 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION then:

- Disables automatic deployment (`git.deploymentEnabled: false`)
- Uses GitHub Actions to control when deployments occur
- Ensures only quality-validated code reaches production
