# DEV-PROD-VERIFICATION: Production Site Verification

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Automated verification that deployed site is working correctly for reliable founder testing"_

Implement automated production verification using existing Playwright E2E tests to ensure deployed site at https://voder.ai is functioning correctly and not showing holding pages or errors.

## How This Story Contributes

This story ensures deployment success can be verified programmatically, preventing situations where we incorrectly assume the site is live when it's actually showing hosting provider holding pages or experiencing failures.

## User Story

So that I can confidently share the voder.ai URL with founders knowing it will work correctly, as a product owner, I want automated verification that confirms the deployed site is serving our content (not holding pages) and all functionality works as expected.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Production verification can be implemented independently from deployment infrastructure
- **Negotiable**: Verification approach and timing can be refined based on feedback
- **Valuable**: Provides confidence in deployment success and prevents embarrassing failures
- **Estimable**: Clear scope for adapting existing E2E tests to production environment
- **Small**: Can be completed by configuring existing test infrastructure
- **Testable**: Success measured by verification script correctly identifying working vs broken deployments

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Production E2E Script**: `npm run e2e:ci:prod` runs Playwright tests against https://voder.ai
- [ ] **Content Verification**: Tests verify actual site content (not Namecheap/hosting holding pages)
- [ ] **Visual Regression**: Screenshot tests confirm visual appearance matches expectations
- [ ] **Functionality Testing**: Interactive elements work correctly in production environment
- [ ] **Failure Detection**: Tests fail when site shows holding pages, errors, or wrong content
- [ ] **Clear Reporting**: Test results clearly indicate production site health status
- [ ] **Integration Ready**: Script can be integrated into CI/CD pipeline for post-deployment verification

## Requirements

### Production Testing Infrastructure

- **REQ-PROD-E2E-SCRIPT**: npm script that runs existing Playwright tests against production URL
- **REQ-BASE-URL-CONFIG**: Environment variable configuration for targeting https://voder.ai
- **REQ-CONTENT-VALIDATION**: Tests verify expected site content is present (title, key elements)
- **REQ-HOLDING-PAGE-DETECTION**: Tests fail if response contains "namecheap", "holding page"

### Verification Scope

- **REQ-VISUAL-REGRESSION**: Screenshot comparison tests run against production site
- **REQ-ACCESSIBILITY-CHECKS**: Accessibility validation runs in production environment
- **REQ-PERFORMANCE-VALIDATION**: Basic performance checks (page load, resource loading)
- **REQ-RESPONSIVE-TESTING**: Multi-viewport testing works in production

### Reporting and Integration

- **REQ-CLEAR-PASS-FAIL**: Verification results clearly indicate site health status
- **REQ-FAILURE-DETAILS**: Failed tests provide specific information about what's wrong
- **REQ-CI-COMPATIBLE**: Test output format compatible with CI/CD systems
- **REQ-TIMEOUT-HANDLING**: Appropriate timeouts for production network conditions

### Quality Standards

- **REQ-RELIABLE-TESTS**: Tests are stable and don't produce false positives/negatives
- **REQ-COMPREHENSIVE-COVERAGE**: Verification covers critical user journeys and content
- **REQ-FAST-EXECUTION**: Production verification completes in reasonable time (<5 minutes)
- **REQ-ERROR-RESILIENCE**: Tests handle network issues and temporary outages gracefully

- 014.0-DEV-DEPLOY (requires working deployment infrastructure)
- 012.0-DEV-E2E-SCREENSHOTS (requires existing Playwright test suite)
