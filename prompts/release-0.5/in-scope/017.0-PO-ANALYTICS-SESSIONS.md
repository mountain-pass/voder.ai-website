# PO-ANALYTICS-SESSIONS: Track User Sessions and Return Visits

## Release Goal

_"Essential Developer Experience - Quality feedback essentials for high-quality code development"_

Provide immediate feedback loops for code quality through comprehensive linting and testing tools that catch issues during development, ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the AI slop problem validation website.

## How This Story Contributes

This story enables the product owner to understand visitor engagement patterns by tracking sessions and return visits, providing insight into whether the AI slop content is compelling enough to bring people back or generate multiple sessions.

## User Story

So that I can understand visitor engagement patterns and whether people return to read more about the AI slop problem, as a product owner, I want to track user sessions, session frequency, and return visitor behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- User sessions are accurately tracked and counted
- New vs. returning visitor metrics are clearly differentiated
- Session frequency and return visit patterns are reported
- Session data includes device and browser information
- Multi-session user behavior is tracked over time
- Reports show session trends and visitor loyalty metrics

## Requirements (to be implemented)

- **REQ-SESSION-DEFINITION**: Clear session start/end logic and timeout rules
- **REQ-VISITOR-CLASSIFICATION**: New vs. returning visitor identification
- **REQ-RETURN-TRACKING**: Return visit frequency and timing tracking
- **REQ-SESSION-REPORTS**: Comprehensive session-based reporting
- **REQ-LOYALTY-METRICS**: Visitor engagement and loyalty measurement

## Dependencies

- 014.0-PO-ANALYTICS-PAGEVIEWS (requires basic page tracking before measuring sessions)
- 013.0-BIZ-BRAND-ENTRY (requires functioning website to track sessions)
