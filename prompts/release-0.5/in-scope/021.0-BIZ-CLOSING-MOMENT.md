# CLOSE-1: Coming Soon Message

## Release Goal

_"Test if ONE AI slop description resonates strongly with founders"_

Release 0.5 is the absolute minimum test of our riskiest assumption: can we articulate the AI slop problem in a way that founders immediately recognize as their exact problem? This release focuses purely on message validation before investing in larger development efforts.

## How This Story Contributes

This story provides closure to the single-page experience and captures interest for future engagement. It signals that we have a solution coming without making promises we can't yet keep, while providing a way for interested founders to stay connected.

## User Story

So that I can follow up when solutions become available, as a founder who resonates with the AI slop problem, I want a simple way to express interest and stay informed about Voder's progress.
