# DEV-CI-SECURITY: Security and Vulnerability Pipeline

## Release Goal

_"Release 0.5: Problem Validation - Establish automated security validation"_

Implement comprehensive GitHub Actions security workflows that automatically scan for vulnerabilities, detect secrets, perform code analysis, and generate security reports for every commit and on a scheduled basis, ensuring the validation website meets security standards.

## How This Story Contributes

This story protects the validation experiment by implementing automated security scanning that prevents vulnerable dependencies, leaked credentials, and security vulnerabilities from reaching production. It ensures founders interact with a secure validation environment without compromising project security.

## User Story

So that I can maintain security standards without manual security reviews, as a developer, I want automated security workflows that scan dependencies for vulnerabilities, detect committed secrets, analyze code for security issues, and generate security reports.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can be implemented as standalone security workflows
- **Negotiable**: Security check frequency and thresholds can be refined
- **Valuable**: Prevents security vulnerabilities and credential leaks
- **Estimable**: Clear scope of security scanning workflows
- **Small**: Focused on security-specific workflows only
- **Testable**: Success measured by security scan execution and vulnerability detection

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Security Audit Workflow**: Automated npm audit with vulnerability reporting
- [ ] **Secret Scanning**: Automatic detection of committed credentials and API keys
- [ ] **Code Scanning**: CodeQL analysis for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Scheduled Security**: Daily security scans independent of code changes
- [ ] **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials for dependency tracking
- [ ] **Security Report Generation**: Security findings exported and viewable via GitHub CLI (`gh run view` for workflow results)
- [ ] **Vulnerability Alerts**: Automated notifications for security issues
- [ ] **Emergency Override**: Capability to deploy with known non-critical vulnerabilities

## Requirements

### Security Audit Pipeline

- **REQ-NPM-AUDIT**: Automated npm audit for dependency vulnerabilities
- **REQ-AUDIT-PARSING**: Parse audit results and fail on high-severity issues
- **REQ-SBOM-GENERATION**: Generate Software Bill of Materials for compliance
- **REQ-AUDIT-SCHEDULE**: Daily scheduled security audits independent of code changes

### Secret Detection

- **REQ-SECRET-SCANNING**: Automatic detection of secrets in commits
- **REQ-CREDENTIAL-PREVENTION**: Block commits containing API keys, tokens, passwords
- **REQ-SECRET-ALERTS**: Immediate notifications when secrets are detected
- **REQ-HISTORICAL-SCAN**: Scan commit history for previously committed secrets

### Code Security Analysis

- **REQ-CODEQL-ANALYSIS**: CodeQL static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **REQ-SARIF-UPLOAD**: Upload security analysis results to GitHub Security tab
- **REQ-SECURITY-ADVISORIES**: Integration with GitHub security advisories
- **REQ-VULNERABILITY-DATABASE**: Use updated vulnerability databases

### Reporting and Monitoring

- **REQ-SECURITY-DASHBOARD**: Security status visible in GitHub repository
- **REQ-VULNERABILITY-TRACKING**: Track and manage identified vulnerabilities
- **REQ-SECURITY-METRICS**: Monitor security scan success rates and trends
- **REQ-CLI-ASSESSMENT**: Security status verifiable via `gh` command line tools

## Workflows to Implement

### 1. Security Audit Workflow (security-audit.yml)

- **Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests, daily schedule
- **Jobs**: npm audit, SBOM generation, vulnerability reporting
- **Artifacts**: Audit reports, SBOM files, security summaries

### 2. Code Scanning Workflow (code-scanning.yml)

- **Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests, weekly schedule
- **Jobs**: CodeQL analysis, SARIF upload, security alerts
- **Artifacts**: SARIF files, security analysis reports

### 3. Secret Scanning Workflow (secret-scan.yml)

- **Triggers**: Push events, pull requests
- **Jobs**: Secret detection, credential validation, alert generation
- **Artifacts**: Secret scan reports, remediation guidance

## Implementation Details

### Security Audit Configuration

```yaml
name: Security Audit
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *' # Daily at 02:00 UTC

jobs:
  security-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm audit --json > audit.json
      - run: node .github/scripts/parse-audit.js
```

### Integration Requirements

- Leverage existing npm scripts and security configurations
- Integrate with GitHub Security tab for centralized reporting
- Connect with notification systems for immediate alerts

## Dependencies

- 002.0-DEV-ENV-NODE (requires Node.js environment)
- 021.1-DEV-CI-CORE (may share infrastructure with core CI)

## Success Metrics

- **Zero high-severity vulnerabilities** in production deployments
- **100% secret detection** - no credentials committed to repository
- **Daily security validation** - automated scans complete successfully
- **Sub-5-minute security feedback** - security checks complete quickly
- **Clear remediation guidance** - security issues include fix instructions
