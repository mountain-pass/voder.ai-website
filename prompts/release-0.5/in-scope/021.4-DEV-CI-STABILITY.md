# DEV-CI-STABILITY: E2E Stability Monitoring

## Release Goal

_"Release 0.5: Problem Validation - Establish long-term stability monitoring"_

Implement GitHub Actions nightly stability monitoring workflow that performs comprehensive E2E testing, tracks stability trends over time, validates production environment health, and provides early warning of stability degradation independent of development cycles.

## How This Story Contributes

This story ensures long-term reliability by implementing proactive stability monitoring that detects issues before they impact founder validation sessions. It provides trend analysis and early warning systems that help maintain confidence in the validation platform's reliability over time.

## User Story

So that I can proactively detect stability issues and track system health trends, as a developer, I want automated nightly stability monitoring that runs comprehensive E2E tests, analyzes stability trends, validates production environment health, and alerts on degradation patterns.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can be implemented as standalone monitoring workflow
- **Negotiable**: Monitoring frequency and stability thresholds can be refined
- **Valuable**: Provides early warning of stability issues and trend analysis
- **Estimable**: Clear scope of single stability monitoring workflow
- **Small**: Single e2e-stability.yml workflow focused on stability tracking
- **Testable**: Success measured by stability trend accuracy and early detection

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Nightly Monitoring**: Automated nightly E2E stability testing trackable via GitHub CLI (`gh run list --workflow=e2e-stability.yml`)
- [ ] **Trend Analysis**: Long-term stability trend tracking and reporting
- [ ] **Production Validation**: Validates actual production environment health
- [ ] **Stability Metrics**: Tracks test success rates, performance trends, error patterns
- [ ] **Early Warning**: Alerts when stability trends indicate degradation
- [ ] **Historical Data**: Maintains historical stability data for analysis
- [ ] **Manual Triggering**: Support for on-demand stability validation
- [ ] **Stability Reports**: Generate comprehensive stability analysis reports

## Implementation Details

### Workflow Structure (e2e-stability.yml)

```yaml
name: Nightly E2E Stability Report
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 3 * * *' # Daily at 03:00 UTC
  workflow_dispatch: {}

jobs:
  stability-monitoring:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run e2e:ci:prod
      - run: node .github/scripts/generate-stability-report.js
```

### Stability Analysis Components

- Long-term trend analysis of test success rates
- Performance degradation detection
- Error pattern analysis and classification
- Production environment health validation

### Reporting and Alerting

- Daily stability reports with trend analysis
- Automated alerts for stability degradation
- Historical data preservation for analysis

## Dependencies

- 012.3-DEV-E2E-TESTING (requires E2E testing framework)
- 012.4-DEV-E2E-SCREENSHOTS (requires screenshot validation capability)
- 014.0-DEV-DEPLOY (requires production environment to monitor)

## Success Metrics

- **95%+ stability detection accuracy** - correctly identifies stability issues
