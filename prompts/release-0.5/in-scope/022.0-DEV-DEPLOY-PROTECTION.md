# DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION: Vercel Deployment Quality Gates

## Release Goal

_"Release 0.5: Problem Validation - Ensure only quality-validated code reaches production"_

Implement Vercel deployment protection that integrates with GitHub Actions to prevent broken deployments while maintaining trunk-based development workflow, ensuring founders only see high-quality validation experiences.

## How This Story Contributes

This story ensures deployment reliability by creating quality gates that block broken code from reaching production without requiring branch protection rules. It maintains the fast feedback loop of trunk-based development while preventing failed CI from deploying broken experiences to founders testing our validation hypothesis.

## User Story

So that I can maintain rapid deployment cycles without risking broken experiences for founder validation sessions, as a developer, I want Vercel deployment protection that automatically blocks deployments when GitHub Actions quality checks fail, while still allowing direct commits to main branch.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can be implemented without changing existing CI/deployment workflows
- **Negotiable**: Protection rules and thresholds can be refined based on team needs
- **Valuable**: Prevents production breakages that could invalidate founder feedback
- **Estimable**: Clear scope involving Vercel configuration and GitHub Actions integration
- **Small**: Can be completed by configuring existing tools and adding webhook endpoints
- **Testable**: Success measured by blocked deployments when CI fails and successful deployments when CI passes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Quality Gate Integration**: Vercel waits for GitHub Actions CI completion before deploying
- [ ] **Deployment Blocking**: Failed GitHub Actions prevent Vercel deployment to production
- [ ] **Deployment Success Verification**: Push to main branch triggers deployment and verifies successful completion using Vercel CLI (`vercel ls` and `vercel inspect`)
- [ ] **Trunk-Based Compatibility**: Works with direct commits to main branch (no branch protection required)
- [ ] **Preview Deployments**: Pull request preview deployments remain unaffected
- [ ] **Manual Override**: Emergency deployment capability when quality checks are non-critical
- [ ] **Status Visibility**: Clear deployment status showing quality check results
- [ ] **Fast Feedback**: Deployment starts immediately after successful CI completion
- [ ] **Rollback Capability**: Failed deployments can be quickly rolled back
- [ ] **Vercel CLI Status Verification**: Use `vercel ls` to list deployments and `vercel inspect <deployment-url>` to verify the deployment is healthy and successful

## Requirements

### Core Protection Requirements

- **REQ-CI-INTEGRATION**: Vercel deployment waits for GitHub Actions status checks from CI pipeline stories (021.1, 021.2, 021.3) - NO duplicate quality checks in Vercel
- **REQ-QUALITY-BLOCKING**: Failed CI checks (lint, test, build, security) block production deployment
- **REQ-DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION**: Every push to main branch MUST verify actual deployment success/failure status - not just CI completion. Use Vercel CLI commands (`vercel ls`, `vercel inspect`) or Vercel API to confirm real deployment status and detect deployment failures even when CI passes
- **REQ-ACTUAL-DEPLOY-STATUS**: Protection system MUST detect and report actual Vercel deployment failures, not just GitHub Actions status. Failed deployments must be clearly identified and reported even if quality gates pass
- **REQ-TRUNK-COMPATIBLE**: No branch protection rules required - works with direct main commits
- **REQ-WAIT-ONLY**: Vercel build process should be minimal (build + deploy only) - all quality validation happens in GitHub Actions
- **REQ-STATUS-CHECKS**: Monitor GitHub Actions workflows from CI pipeline stories:
  - `CI & Playwright multi-browser tests` (from 021.1-DEV-CI-CORE)
  - `Deploy to Production` (from 021.3-DEV-CI-DEPLOY)
  - `Security Audit` (from 021.2-DEV-CI-SECURITY)
- **REQ-CLI-VERIFICATION**: Use GitHub CLI (`gh run list`, `gh run view`) to verify actual GitHub Actions status and Vercel CLI (`vercel ls`, `vercel inspect`) to verify actual deployment status
- **REQ-DEPLOYMENT-FAILURE-DETECTION**: System MUST distinguish between CI failures (which block deployment) and deployment failures (which occur after CI passes but Vercel deployment fails)

### Deployment Control Requirements

- **REQ-PRODUCTION-ONLY**: Protection applies only to production deployments (not preview)
- **REQ-EMERGENCY-OVERRIDE**: Manual deployment trigger for critical fixes
- **REQ-TIMEOUT-HANDLING**: Deployment proceeds if CI takes longer than threshold (15 minutes)
- **REQ-PARTIAL-FAILURE**: Define which CI failures are blocking vs. warning-only

### Integration Requirements

- **REQ-VERCEL-CONFIG**: Configure Vercel deployment protection via vercel.json or dashboard
- **REQ-GITHUB-WEBHOOK**: GitHub status check webhook integration with Vercel
- **REQ-STATUS-REPORTING**: Clear status reporting in both Vercel and GitHub interfaces
- **REQ-NOTIFICATION**: Team notifications for blocked deployments

### Performance Requirements

- **REQ-DEPLOY-SPEED**: Successful deployments start within 30 seconds of CI completion
- **REQ-STATUS-LATENCY**: Status check results propagate to Vercel within 60 seconds
- **REQ-ROLLBACK-SPEED**: Failed deployments can be rolled back within 2 minutes

### Monitoring Requirements

- **REQ-DEPLOY-METRICS**: Track deployment success/failure rates
- **REQ-DEPLOY-VERIFICATION**: Monitor and log actual deployment completion status for every push - verify real Vercel deployment outcome, not just CI status
- **REQ-DEPLOYMENT-STATUS-TRACKING**: Continuously monitor actual deployment status and distinguish between different failure types (CI failure vs deployment failure vs runtime failure)
- **REQ-BLOCK-TRACKING**: Monitor how often deployments are blocked by quality gates
- **REQ-CI-TIMING**: Track CI completion times to optimize timeout thresholds
- **REQ-ALERT-SYSTEM**: Automated alerts for deployment protection failures AND actual deployment failures
- **REQ-REAL-TIME-STATUS**: Provide real-time deployment status visibility showing actual Vercel deployment state, not just GitHub Actions state

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Vercel Deployment Protection (Recommended)

- Use Vercel's built-in GitHub status check integration
- Configure required status checks in Vercel project settings
- **Vercel waits for GitHub Actions completion** - no duplicate quality checks
- Vercel build process is minimal (build + deploy only)
- Maintains simplicity with vendor-managed protection

### Option 2: GitHub Actions Controlled Deployment

- Modify GitHub Actions to trigger Vercel deployment only after success
- Disable automatic Vercel deployments
- Add deployment verification step to confirm successful deployment
- Provides maximum control but adds complexity

### Option 3: Webhook-Based Protection

- Custom webhook endpoint that validates GitHub status before allowing deployment
- Include deployment success verification in webhook flow
- Requires additional infrastructure but offers flexibility

### Deployment Verification Implementation

**Verification Methods:**

- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Add deployment verification step to existing workflows
- **GitHub CLI Verification**: Use `gh run list --branch main` and `gh run view` to verify actual workflow execution status
- **Vercel CLI Verification**: Use `vercel ls` to list deployments and `vercel inspect <deployment-url>` to verify actual deployment status and health
- **Health Check Endpoint**: Verify deployed application responds correctly
- **Deployment Status API**: Monitor Vercel deployment status via API

**Success Criteria:**

- Deployment completes without errors (verified via `vercel inspect`)
- GitHub Actions workflows complete successfully (verified via `gh run view`)
- Application health check passes
- New deployment URL returns 200 status
- Critical functionality verified through smoke tests

## Dependencies

- 014.0-DEV-DEPLOY (requires existing Vercel deployment setup)
- 021.1-DEV-CI-CORE (requires core CI workflow for quality checks)
- 021.2-DEV-CI-SECURITY (requires security workflows for vulnerability scanning)
- 021.3-DEV-CI-DEPLOY (requires deployment readiness validation)
- 001.1-PO-DECISION-MANAGEMENT (architectural decision for protection approach)

## Configuration Changes Required

### Vercel Project Settings

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "github": {
    "deploymentStatus": "deployment_protection",
    "requiredStatusChecks": [
      "CI & Playwright multi-browser tests",
      "Deploy to Production",
      "Security Audit"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note**: Vercel build command is minimal (`npm run build`) since all quality checks (lint, test, security) are validated in GitHub Actions before deployment is allowed.

### GitHub Actions Modifications

- Ensure workflow names from CI pipeline stories (021.1, 021.2, 021.3) match Vercel configuration
- Add deployment status reporting to workflow outputs
- Configure proper timeout handling for long-running tests

## Success Metrics

- **Zero broken deployments** reaching production when CI fails
- **Sub-30-second deployment start** after successful CI
- **100% compatibility** with trunk-based development workflow
- **Emergency override** capability tested and documented
