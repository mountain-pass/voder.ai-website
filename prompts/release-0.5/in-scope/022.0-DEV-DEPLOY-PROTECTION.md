# DEV-DEPLOY-PROTECTION: Vercel Deployment Quality Gates

## Release Goal

_"Release 0.5: Problem Validation - Ensure only quality-validated code reaches production"_

Implement Vercel deployment protection that integrates with GitHub Actions to prevent broken deployments while maintaining trunk-based development workflow, ensuring founders only see high-quality validation experiences.

## How This Story Contributes

This story ensures deployment reliability by creating quality gates that block broken code from reaching production without requiring branch protection rules. It maintains the fast feedback loop of trunk-based development while preventing failed CI from deploying broken experiences to founders testing our validation hypothesis.

## User Story

So that I can maintain rapid deployment cycles without risking broken experiences for founder validation sessions, as a developer, I want Vercel deployment protection that automatically blocks deployments when GitHub Actions quality checks fail, while still allowing direct commits to main branch.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can be implemented without changing existing CI/deployment workflows
- **Negotiable**: Protection rules and thresholds can be refined based on team needs
- **Valuable**: Prevents production breakages that could invalidate founder feedback
- **Estimable**: Clear scope involving Vercel configuration and GitHub Actions integration
- **Small**: Can be completed by configuring existing tools and adding webhook endpoints
- **Testable**: Success measured by blocked deployments when CI fails and successful deployments when CI passes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Quality Gate Integration**: Vercel waits for GitHub Actions CI completion before deploying
- [ ] **Deployment Blocking**: Failed GitHub Actions prevent Vercel deployment to production
- [ ] **Trunk-Based Compatibility**: Works with direct commits to main branch (no branch protection required)
- [ ] **Preview Deployments**: Pull request preview deployments remain unaffected
- [ ] **Manual Override**: Emergency deployment capability when quality checks are non-critical
- [ ] **Status Visibility**: Clear deployment status showing quality check results
- [ ] **Fast Feedback**: Deployment starts immediately after successful CI completion
- [ ] **Rollback Capability**: Failed deployments can be quickly rolled back

## Requirements

### Core Protection Requirements

- **REQ-CI-INTEGRATION**: Vercel deployment waits for GitHub Actions status checks from CI pipeline stories (021.1, 021.2, 021.3)
- **REQ-QUALITY-BLOCKING**: Failed CI checks (lint, test, build, security) block production deployment
- **REQ-TRUNK-COMPATIBLE**: No branch protection rules required - works with direct main commits
- **REQ-STATUS-CHECKS**: Monitor GitHub Actions workflows from CI pipeline stories:
  - `CI & Playwright multi-browser tests` (from 021.1-DEV-CI-CORE)
  - `Deploy to Production` (from 021.3-DEV-CI-DEPLOY)
  - `Security Audit` (from 021.2-DEV-CI-SECURITY)

### Deployment Control Requirements

- **REQ-PRODUCTION-ONLY**: Protection applies only to production deployments (not preview)
- **REQ-EMERGENCY-OVERRIDE**: Manual deployment trigger for critical fixes
- **REQ-TIMEOUT-HANDLING**: Deployment proceeds if CI takes longer than threshold (15 minutes)
- **REQ-PARTIAL-FAILURE**: Define which CI failures are blocking vs. warning-only

### Integration Requirements

- **REQ-VERCEL-CONFIG**: Configure Vercel deployment protection via vercel.json or dashboard
- **REQ-GITHUB-WEBHOOK**: GitHub status check webhook integration with Vercel
- **REQ-STATUS-REPORTING**: Clear status reporting in both Vercel and GitHub interfaces
- **REQ-NOTIFICATION**: Team notifications for blocked deployments

### Performance Requirements

- **REQ-DEPLOY-SPEED**: Successful deployments start within 30 seconds of CI completion
- **REQ-STATUS-LATENCY**: Status check results propagate to Vercel within 60 seconds
- **REQ-ROLLBACK-SPEED**: Failed deployments can be rolled back within 2 minutes

### Monitoring Requirements

- **REQ-DEPLOY-METRICS**: Track deployment success/failure rates
- **REQ-BLOCK-TRACKING**: Monitor how often deployments are blocked by quality gates
- **REQ-CI-TIMING**: Track CI completion times to optimize timeout thresholds
- **REQ-ALERT-SYSTEM**: Automated alerts for deployment protection failures

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Vercel Deployment Protection (Recommended)

- Use Vercel's built-in GitHub status check integration
- Configure required status checks in Vercel project settings
- Maintains simplicity with vendor-managed protection

### Option 2: GitHub Actions Controlled Deployment

- Modify GitHub Actions to trigger Vercel deployment only after success
- Disable automatic Vercel deployments
- Provides maximum control but adds complexity

### Option 3: Webhook-Based Protection

- Custom webhook endpoint that validates GitHub status before allowing deployment
- Requires additional infrastructure but offers flexibility

## Dependencies

- 014.0-DEV-DEPLOY (requires existing Vercel deployment setup)
- 021.1-DEV-CI-CORE (requires core CI workflow for quality checks)
- 021.2-DEV-CI-SECURITY (requires security workflows for vulnerability scanning)
- 021.3-DEV-CI-DEPLOY (requires deployment readiness validation)
- 001.1-PO-DECISION-MANAGEMENT (architectural decision for protection approach)

## Configuration Changes Required

### Vercel Project Settings

```json
{
  "github": {
    "deploymentStatus": "deployment_protection",
    "requiredStatusChecks": [
      "CI & Playwright multi-browser tests",
      "Deploy to Production",
      "Security Audit"
    ]
  }
}
```

### GitHub Actions Modifications

- Ensure workflow names from CI pipeline stories (021.1, 021.2, 021.3) match Vercel configuration
- Add deployment status reporting to workflow outputs
- Configure proper timeout handling for long-running tests

## Success Metrics

- **Zero broken deployments** reaching production when CI fails
- **Sub-30-second deployment start** after successful CI
- **100% compatibility** with trunk-based development workflow
- **Emergency override** capability tested and documented
