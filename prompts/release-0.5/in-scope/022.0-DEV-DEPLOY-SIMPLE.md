# DEV-DEPLOY-SIMPLE: Basic Automated Production Deployment

## Release Goal

_"Release 0.5: Problem Validation - Enable basic deployment capability"_

Establish automated deployment capability that gets code changes from GitHub to production with minimal manual intervention. This provides the foundation for continuous deployment that can be enhanced with quality gates and validation in future stories.

## How This Story Contributes

This story enables developers to deploy the voder.ai website changes automatically, removing manual deployment overhead and reducing deployment friction. It establishes the basic deployment pipeline infrastructure needed for rapid iteration during problem validation.

## User Story

So that I can deploy changes to production automatically without manual intervention, as a developer, I want a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys the site when I push to main branch.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: ✅ Can be implemented with existing build process and hosting platform
- **Negotiable**: ✅ Deployment trigger and validation steps can be refined
- **Valuable**: ✅ Enables automated deployment capability for rapid iteration
- **Estimable**: ✅ Clear scope - automated workflow with build and deploy steps
- **Small**: ✅ MINIMAL - Basic automation, no complex quality gates
- **Testable**: ✅ Success measured by successful automated deployment to production

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Deployment workflow exists and executes automatically
- [ ] **Build Integration**: Workflow runs production build process successfully
- [ ] **Automated Deployment**: Site deploys to production hosting platform automatically
- [ ] **Main Branch Trigger**: Workflow triggers only on push to main branch
- [ ] **Deployment Success**: Site accessible at production URL after workflow completes
- [ ] **Basic Error Handling**: Workflow fails gracefully if build or deploy fails
- [ ] **Deployment Verification**: Automated verification that deployment completed successfully

## Requirements

### Automated Deployment Pipeline

- **REQ-MAIN-TRIGGER**: Deploy automatically on push to main branch only
- **REQ-BUILD-INTEGRATION**: Execute production build process in deployment workflow
- **REQ-HOSTING-DEPLOY**: Deploy built assets to production hosting platform
- **REQ-DEPLOYMENT-SUCCESS**: Ensure site is accessible after deployment completes

### Reliability Requirements

- **REQ-ERROR-HANDLING**: Workflow fails gracefully with clear error reporting
- **REQ-DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION**: Automated verification of successful deployment
- **REQ-SECURE-DEPLOYMENT**: Use secure authentication for deployment platform

### Compliance with Architectural Decisions

- **REQ-CI-PLATFORM**: Follow GitHub Actions deployment decisions (per future ADR)
- **REQ-HOSTING-PLATFORM**: Use selected production hosting platform (per future ADR)
- **REQ-BUILD-PROCESS**: Leverage existing build system (per ADR-0005 Vite build)

## Dependencies

- 005.0-DEV-BUILD-VITE (requires working production build process)
- Production hosting platform account and configuration
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled

## Success Criteria

- ✅ **Automated Deployment**: Push to main → site updates on production URL automatically
- ✅ **Build Integration**: Production build process executes successfully in CI
- ✅ **Platform Integration**: Hosting platform deployment works reliably
- ✅ **Deployment Verification**: Automated confirmation of successful deployment
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear failure reporting when deployment issues occur

## Out of Scope (Future Stories)

- **Quality Gates**: Code quality validation before deployment
- **Post-Deployment Validation**: Health checks and smoke tests
- **Rollback Capability**: Automatic rollback on deployment failure
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Detailed error reporting and notifications
- **Manual Triggers**: Workflow dispatch for manual deployments
- **Environment Management**: Complex configuration and environment variables
- **Preview Deployments**: Branch-based preview environments

This story focuses on establishing reliable automated deployment. Quality gates, validation, and rollback capabilities will be added in subsequent stories once the foundation is established.
