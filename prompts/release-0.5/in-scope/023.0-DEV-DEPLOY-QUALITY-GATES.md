# 023.0-DEV-DEPLOY-QUALITY-GATES: Pre-Deployment Quality Verification

## Release Goal

_"Release 0.5: Essential Dev Experience - Establish quality gates that prevent problematic deployments in trunk-based development workflow"_

Implement comprehensive pre-deployment quality checks that must pass before any code reaches production, supporting high-velocity trunk-based development with confidence through automated quality verification.

## How This Story Contributes

This story provides the critical safety net for trunk-based development, enabling frequent commits to main branch while ensuring only quality code reaches production. It builds on the working deployment foundation (022.0) by adding essential quality gates that prevent deployment of broken code, supporting DORA-style high deployment frequency with low change failure rates.

## User Story

So that only high-quality code reaches production and I can deploy frequently with confidence, as a developer, I want comprehensive quality checks that automatically block deployments when code quality, tests, security, or build standards are not met.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Enhances existing deployment without changing core deployment logic
- **Negotiable**: Which specific quality checks to include can be refined during implementation
- **Valuable**: Prevents production issues through proactive quality verification
- **Estimable**: Clear scope - integrate existing quality pipeline into deployment workflow
- **Small**: Single workflow modification leveraging existing `npm run verify` pipeline
- **Testable**: Can verify deployment blocks on quality failures and proceeds on quality success

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Quality Pipeline Integration**: All `npm run verify` checks (audit, lint, format, build, test) must pass before deployment
- [ ] **Deployment Blocking**: Failed quality checks prevent deployment from triggering
- [ ] **Fast Feedback**: Quality check failures reported within 30 seconds with specific failure details
- [ ] **Parallel Execution**: Quality checks run in parallel where possible to minimize total time
- [ ] **Clear Status Reporting**: Quality gate status clearly visible in GitHub Actions with specific failure reasons
- [ ] **GitHub Status Integration**: Quality gate status appears as GitHub status check on commits
- [ ] **Job Dependencies**: Deployment job only starts after successful quality gate completion

## Requirements

### Quality Gate Implementation

- **REQ-VERIFY-INTEGRATION**: Must use existing `npm run verify` command that includes audit, lint, format, build, and test
- **REQ-DEPLOYMENT-BLOCKING**: Deployment job MUST NOT start unless quality gates pass completely
- **REQ-FAILURE-REPORTING**: Failed quality checks must provide specific error details and remediation guidance
- **REQ-STATUS-VISIBILITY**: Quality gate status must be visible in GitHub Actions UI and commit status checks

### Performance Requirements

- **REQ-FEEDBACK-SPEED**: Quality check failures reported within 30 seconds of job start
- **REQ-PARALLEL-EXECUTION**: Independent quality checks run in parallel to minimize total execution time
- **REQ-CACHE-UTILIZATION**: Leverage npm cache and build cache to speed up quality checks

### Integration with Deployment

- **REQ-JOB-DEPENDENCY**: GitHub Actions deployment job must depend on successful quality-gates job
- **REQ-WORKFLOW-ORGANIZATION**: Quality gates and deployment organized as separate jobs for clear separation
- **REQ-ARTIFACT-SHARING**: Build artifacts from quality gates shared with deployment job to avoid rebuilding

### Trunk-Based Development Support

- **REQ-MAIN-BRANCH-FOCUS**: Quality gates run on every push to main branch (trunk-based development)
- **REQ-FAST-FEEDBACK**: Support frequent commits with rapid quality feedback
- **REQ-CONFIDENCE-BUILDING**: Enable developers to commit frequently while maintaining production quality

### Compliance with Architectural Decisions

- **IMPL-DORA-TRUNK-BASED**: Implements ADR-0024 trunk-based development with quality assurance
- **IMPL-GITHUB-ACTIONS-DEPLOYMENT**: Extends ADR-0029 GitHub Actions controlled deployment with quality gates
- **IMPL-EXISTING-TOOLS**: Leverages existing quality tools per ADR-0003 (ESLint/Prettier), ADR-0005 (Vitest), etc.

## Dependencies

- 022.0-DEV-DEPLOY-SIMPLE (working GitHub Actions deployment to extend with quality gates)
- 010.0-DEV-LINT-JS (JavaScript linting that contributes to quality pipeline)
- 011.0-DEV-TEST-UNIT (unit testing that contributes to quality pipeline)
- 006.0-DEV-FORMAT (code formatting that contributes to quality pipeline)
- 005.0-DEV-BUILD-VITE (build process that contributes to quality pipeline)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Quality Gate Workflow Structure

```yaml
jobs:
  quality-gates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - name: Quality Gates
        run: npm run verify  # audit → lint → format → build → test

  deploy:
    needs: quality-gates  # Only deploy if quality passes
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # ... existing deployment steps
```

### Quality Check Components

- **Dependency Audit**: `npm audit` for security vulnerabilities
- **Code Linting**: ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript quality
- **Code Formatting**: Prettier format checking
- **Build Verification**: Vite build success
- **Test Execution**: Vitest unit test suite
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript compilation verification

### Error Handling

- **Specific Failure Reporting**: Each quality check failure provides specific error details
- **Remediation Guidance**: Failed checks include guidance on how to fix issues
- **Exit Code Propagation**: Failed quality checks properly propagate exit codes to fail the job
- **Status Check Integration**: Failed quality gates appear as failed status checks on commits
