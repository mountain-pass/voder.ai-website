# PO-SECURITY-INCIDENT-MANAGEMENT: Security Incident Management System

## Release Goal

_"Release 0.5: Essential Development Foundation - Establish systematic security incident tracking and response procedures"_

Create a comprehensive security incident management system using structured incident documentation, enabling systematic security event tracking, impact assessment, resolution workflows, and prevention measures to maintain secure development practices and protect sensitive data.

## How This Story Contributes

This story establishes the foundation for systematic security incident response that protects sensitive data, maintains compliance, and ensures rapid response to security threats. By implementing structured security incident management, we can quickly assess impact, implement containment measures, track resolution progress, and prevent future security breaches, crucial for maintaining trust and regulatory compliance.

**Note: This is a process-only meta-story that requires no code implementation. The "implementation" consists entirely of establishing documentation standards, response workflows, and incident tracking procedures.**

## User Story

So that I can maintain security posture and respond systematically to security threats while preventing future incidents, as a product owner, I want a structured security incident management system that tracks incidents from initial detection through containment, resolution, and post-incident review.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Security incident management can be established independently
- **Negotiable**: Template format and response procedures can be refined
- **Valuable**: Provides systematic security threat response and compliance maintenance
- **Estimable**: Clear scope for establishing security incident tracking system
- **Small**: Can be completed through documentation and process setup
- **Testable**: Success measured by consistent incident format, response times, and prevention measures

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Security Incident Template**: Comprehensive template created in prompt-assets/security-incident-template.md
- [ ] **Incident Classification**: Clear severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) with response times
- [ ] **Status Workflow**: Defined incident states (Detected, Investigating, Contained, Resolved, Closed)
- [ ] **Response Procedures**: Step-by-step response procedures for each severity level
- [ ] **Impact Assessment**: Framework for assessing business and technical impact
- [ ] **Documentation Standards**: Consistent format for incident documentation
- [ ] **Storage Location**: Security incidents stored in docs/security-incidents/
- [ ] **Cross-references**: Links to related problems, decisions, and stories
- [ ] **Post-incident Review**: Process for lessons learned and prevention measures
- [ ] **Credential Management**: Procedures for credential rotation and security hardening

## Requirements

### Security Incident Classification

- **REQ-SEVERITY-LEVELS**: Four severity levels with clear criteria:
  - **Critical**: Active data breach, exposed production credentials, system compromise
  - **High**: Exposed development credentials, potential data exposure, security vulnerability in production
  - **Medium**: Security misconfiguration, exposed logs with sensitive data, deprecated security practices
  - **Low**: Security best practice violations, minor configuration issues

- **REQ-RESPONSE-TIMES**: Maximum response times by severity:
  - **Critical**: Immediate response (within 1 hour)
  - **High**: Same business day (within 8 hours)
  - **Medium**: Within 48 hours
  - **Low**: Within 1 week

### Incident Status Workflow

- **REQ-STATUS-STATES**: Defined incident lifecycle states:
  - **DETECTED**: Incident identified but investigation not started
  - **INVESTIGATING**: Active investigation of scope and impact
  - **CONTAINED**: Immediate threat contained, working on resolution
  - **RESOLVED**: Issue fixed, monitoring for effectiveness
  - **CLOSED**: Post-incident review completed, case closed

- **REQ-STATUS-TRANSITIONS**: Clear criteria for status transitions
- **REQ-STATUS-TRACKING**: Timestamps for each status change
- **REQ-REOPENING-CRITERIA**: Conditions under which incidents can be reopened

### Impact Assessment Framework

- **REQ-BUSINESS-IMPACT**: Assessment of business impact:
  - Service availability impact
  - Data confidentiality breach
  - Regulatory compliance implications
  - Reputation and trust impact

- **REQ-TECHNICAL-IMPACT**: Assessment of technical impact:
  - System components affected
  - Data types compromised
  - Integration points impacted
  - Infrastructure security posture

- **REQ-SCOPE-ASSESSMENT**: Clear scope definition:
  - Affected systems and components
  - Timeframe of exposure
  - Potential attack vectors
  - Compromised credentials or data

### Response Procedures

- **REQ-IMMEDIATE-ACTIONS**: Standard immediate response actions:
  - Threat containment procedures
  - Credential rotation workflows
  - System isolation protocols
  - Evidence preservation

- **REQ-INVESTIGATION-PROCEDURES**: Systematic investigation approach:
  - Log analysis procedures
  - Timeline reconstruction
  - Root cause analysis methodology
  - Impact assessment workflows

- **REQ-RESOLUTION-PROCEDURES**: Standard resolution procedures:
  - Security hardening measures
  - System patching protocols
  - Configuration updates
  - Monitoring enhancement

### Documentation Standards

- **REQ-INCIDENT-TEMPLATE**: Structured template for consistent documentation
- **REQ-EVIDENCE-DOCUMENTATION**: Requirements for preserving investigation evidence
- **REQ-TIMELINE-DOCUMENTATION**: Detailed timeline of incident and response
- **REQ-LESSONS-LEARNED**: Mandatory lessons learned documentation

### File Naming and Storage

- **REQ-NAMING-CONVENTION**: Security incidents follow format:
  `SECURITY-INCIDENT-YYYY-MM-DD-{brief-description}.{status}.md`
- **REQ-STORAGE-LOCATION**: All incidents stored in `docs/security-incidents/`
- **REQ-STATUS-IN-FILENAME**: Current status reflected in filename
- **REQ-BACKUP-PROCEDURES**: Sensitive incident data backup and retention procedures

### Post-Incident Review Process

- **REQ-PIR-MANDATORY**: Post-incident review required for High and Critical incidents
- **REQ-PIR-TIMELINE**: PIR completed within 1 week of incident closure
- **REQ-PIR-PARTICIPANTS**: Required participants in post-incident review
- **REQ-PREVENTION-MEASURES**: Identification and implementation of prevention measures

### Integration with Existing Systems

- **REQ-PROBLEM-LINKS**: Links to related technical problems in docs/problems/
- **REQ-DECISION-LINKS**: Links to relevant architectural decisions
- **REQ-STORY-LINKS**: Links to implementing stories for prevention measures
- **REQ-AUDIT-TRAIL**: Maintain audit trail of all incident-related activities

### Credential and Secret Management

- **REQ-CREDENTIAL-INVENTORY**: Maintain inventory of all credentials and secrets
- **REQ-ROTATION-PROCEDURES**: Standard procedures for credential rotation
- **REQ-SECURE-STORAGE**: Requirements for secure credential storage
- **REQ-ACCESS-LOGGING**: Logging and monitoring of credential access

### Compliance and Reporting

- **REQ-INCIDENT-METRICS**: Standard metrics for incident tracking and reporting
- **REQ-TREND-ANALYSIS**: Regular analysis of incident trends and patterns
- **REQ-COMPLIANCE-REPORTING**: Incident reporting for compliance requirements
- **REQ-STAKEHOLDER-COMMUNICATION**: Communication procedures for different stakeholder groups

## Dependencies

- 001.0-PO-STORY-MANAGEMENT (requires story management framework for incident integration)
- 001.1-PO-DECISION-MANAGEMENT (requires decision management for security architecture decisions)
- 025.3-PO-PROBLEM-MANAGEMENT (requires problem management for technical issue integration)

## Notes

- Security incidents are distinct from technical problems and require specialized handling
- Credential rotation procedures must be clearly documented and easily executable
- Post-incident reviews focus on prevention rather than blame
- Integration with existing problem and decision management systems ensures comprehensive tracking
- This system supports both reactive incident response and proactive security posture improvement
