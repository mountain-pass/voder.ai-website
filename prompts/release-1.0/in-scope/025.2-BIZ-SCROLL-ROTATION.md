# 025.2-BIZ-SCROLL-ROTATION: Scroll-Linked Cube Rotation

## Release Goal

_"Release 1.0: MVP Problem Validation - Create engaging scroll-linked 3D interaction that demonstrates sophisticated user experience design and technical capability"_

Implement scroll-synchronized rotation for the glass cube 3D element, where the cube rotates left-to-right in direct proportion to scroll position. The rotation should be locked to scroll progress, providing immediate visual feedback that responds to user input direction and velocity, creating an engaging interactive experience that showcases technical sophistication.

## How This Story Contributes

This story transforms the static 3D cube into an interactive element that responds to user behavior, creating engagement and demonstrating advanced front-end capabilities. The scroll-linked rotation provides immediate visual feedback and creates a sense of direct manipulation, making the site feel more dynamic and responsive while maintaining the elegant visual foundation established by the base 3D animation.

## User Story

So that I experience sophisticated interaction design that responds to my browsing behavior, as a founder visiting the site, I want the glass cube to rotate smoothly left and right as I scroll up and down the page, creating a direct connection between my scroll actions and the visual response that demonstrates attention to user experience detail.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can be implemented as enhancement to existing 3D cube component
- **Negotiable**: Rotation speed, direction mapping, and easing can be refined
- **Valuable**: Creates engaging interaction that demonstrates technical sophistication
- **Estimable**: Clear scope - scroll event binding with rotation transformation
- **Small**: Single interaction enhancement deliverable in one iteration
- **Testable**: Can verify rotation responds correctly to scroll direction and position

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Scroll Position Mapping**: Cube rotation directly correlates to scroll position with consistent ratio
- [ ] **Directional Response**: Scrolling down rotates cube left, scrolling up rotates cube right
- [ ] **Smooth Rotation**: Rotation follows scroll smoothly without lag or jarring movements
- [ ] **Bidirectional Control**: Rotation reverses immediately when scroll direction changes
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Scroll handling uses requestAnimationFrame and throttling for smooth performance
- [ ] **Rotation Bounds**: Cube can rotate continuously without limits in either direction
- [ ] **Initial State**: Cube starts at neutral rotation position when page loads
- [ ] **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Works on desktop scroll wheel, trackpad, and mobile touch scroll
- [ ] **Visual Continuity**: Maintains glass material properties and lighting during rotation
- [ ] **Responsive Scaling**: Rotation sensitivity adjusts appropriately for different viewport sizes
- [ ] **No Performance Degradation**: Maintains smooth 60fps rendering during scroll interactions
- [ ] **Memory Management**: No memory leaks from scroll event handlers or animation frames

## Requirements

### Interaction Design Requirements

- **REQ-SCROLL-LOCK**: Rotation position directly locked to scroll position with 1:1 correspondence
- **REQ-DIRECTIONAL-MAPPING**: Scroll down = rotate left (negative Y-axis), scroll up = rotate right (positive Y-axis)
- **REQ-SMOOTH-RESPONSE**: Rotation follows scroll with no perceivable delay or stuttering
- **REQ-IMMEDIATE-REVERSAL**: Direction changes respond instantly when scroll direction reverses
- **REQ-CONTINUOUS-ROTATION**: No rotation limits - cube can spin multiple full rotations in either direction
- **REQ-NEUTRAL-START**: Cube begins at 0Â° rotation when page loads

### Technical Requirements

- **REQ-PERFORMANCE-SCROLL**: Use requestAnimationFrame and throttling for optimal scroll performance
- **REQ-CROSS-DEVICE**: Compatible with mouse wheel, trackpad, and touch scroll inputs
- **REQ-VIEWPORT-SCALING**: Rotation sensitivity adapts to viewport size for consistent feel
- **REQ-MEMORY-MANAGEMENT**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and animation frames
- **REQ-60FPS-RENDERING**: Maintains smooth 60fps during scroll interactions
- **REQ-THROTTLE-EVENTS**: Scroll events throttled to prevent performance bottlenecks

### User Experience Requirements

- **REQ-INTUITIVE-MAPPING**: Scroll direction to rotation direction feels natural and predictable
- **REQ-VISUAL-FEEDBACK**: Immediate visual response to scroll input creates sense of direct control
- **REQ-CONSISTENT-BEHAVIOR**: Rotation behavior identical across all supported devices and browsers
- **REQ-NON-INTRUSIVE**: Scroll functionality remains normal - rotation is additive enhancement
- **REQ-VISUAL-CONTINUITY**: Glass material, lighting, and overall appearance maintained during rotation
- **REQ-SMOOTH-EXPERIENCE**: No frame drops, stuttering, or visual artifacts during interaction

### Integration Requirements

- **REQ-EXISTING-CUBE**: Builds on existing 3D cube implementation without breaking changes
- **REQ-LIGHTING-PRESERVATION**: Maintains existing lighting setup and material properties
- **REQ-CAMERA-POSITION**: Preserves existing camera positioning and perspective
- **REQ-OVERLAY-COMPATIBILITY**: Content overlay continues to work properly during rotation
- **REQ-SCROLL-BEHAVIOR**: Page scrolling behavior remains unchanged - only adds rotation effect

## Dependencies

- 025.0-BIZ-3D-ANIMATION (requires existing glass cube 3D element as foundation)

## Implementation Notes

### Scroll-Rotation Implementation

**Rotation Mapping**:

- Calculate scroll progress as percentage of total page height
- Map scroll position to rotation angle: `rotation = scrollProgress * rotationMultiplier`
- Rotation multiplier: 0.005 radians per pixel for desktop, 0.003 for mobile
- Y-axis rotation only - maintains corner-first orientation while rotating left/right

**Performance Optimization**:

- Throttle scroll events to ~16ms intervals (60fps)
- Use requestAnimationFrame for rotation updates
- Implement scroll velocity detection for smoother interpolation
- Cache scroll calculations to minimize DOM queries

**Technical Implementation**:

```javascript
// Scroll position mapping
const scrollProgress = window.scrollY;
const rotationY = scrollProgress * rotationMultiplier;
cube.rotation.y = rotationY;

// Performance throttling
let ticking = false;
function updateRotation() {
  if (!ticking) {
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      // Update cube rotation based on scroll
      ticking = false;
    });
    ticking = true;
  }
}
```

**Device Compatibility**:

- Mouse wheel: Standard scroll event handling
- Trackpad: Smooth scrolling with momentum
- Mobile touch: Touch scroll with proper event passive flags
- Responsive sensitivity: Adjust rotation multiplier based on viewport width

### Success Metrics

- **Interaction Responsiveness**: Rotation responds within 16ms of scroll event
- **Performance Maintenance**: No frame drops below 60fps during scroll interactions
- **Cross-Device Consistency**: Identical behavior across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **User Engagement**: Scroll-linked rotation creates satisfying direct manipulation feel
- **Technical Demonstration**: Showcases sophisticated interaction design capabilities
- **Integration Quality**: Enhancement integrates seamlessly without breaking existing functionality

### Foundation for Future Development

**Extensibility Design**:

- Modular scroll handler that can accommodate additional scroll-linked effects
- Rotation system that can be extended to other axes or combined with other animations
- Performance-optimized foundation for more complex scroll interactions
- Clean separation between scroll detection and visual response systems

This story creates an engaging interactive layer that transforms the static 3D cube into a responsive element, demonstrating sophisticated user experience design while maintaining the elegant visual foundation established by the base 3D animation story.
