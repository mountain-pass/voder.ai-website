// Enhanced glass material with proven transparency approach
const glassMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  color: 0x114444, // Rich dark teal for premium appearance
  transparent: true,
  opacity: 0.6, // 40% transparency for optimal visibility and presence
  roughness: 0.05, // Smooth surface for bright reflections
  metalness: 0.0, // Non-metallic for proper glass behavior
  side: THREE.DoubleSide, // Both sides visible for proper transparency
