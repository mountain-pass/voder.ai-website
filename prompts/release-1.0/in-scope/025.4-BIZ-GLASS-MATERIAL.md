# 025.4-BIZ-GLASS-MATERIAL: Enhanced Glass Material Effects

## Release Goal

_"Release 1.0: MVP Problem Validation - Create sophisticated glass material effects that demonstrate advanced 3D rendering capabilities and visual polish"_

Transform the current basic cube material into a sophisticated glass material with proper transparency, reflections, and refractive properties. The glass effect should feature realistic transparency with subtle color tinting, surface reflections that respond to lighting, and the foundation for internal visual effects, creating a premium visual experience that showcases technical sophistication.

## How This Story Contributes

This story elevates the 3D cube from a basic geometric shape to a premium glass object that demonstrates advanced material rendering capabilities. The enhanced glass material creates visual depth and sophistication while establishing the material foundation needed for more complex internal effects in future iterations, making the site feel more polished and technically impressive.
