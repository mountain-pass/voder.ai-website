# BIZ-VIEWPORT-LAYOUT: Above-the-Fold Viewport Layout Optimization

## Release Goal

_"Release 1.0: MVP Problem Validation - Optimize initial viewport layout for immediate visual impact and clear content hierarchy across all device types"_

Create precise, viewport-specific layout specifications that optimize the above-the-fold experience for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Establish clear visual hierarchy, proper spacing ratios, and strategic content positioning to maximize immediate visual impact while ensuring critical messaging is always visible within the initial viewport.

## How This Story Contributes

This story solves critical layout issues identified through visual assessment: excessive whitespace on desktop, overcrowded tablet layout, and cut-off content on mobile. By establishing precise viewport-specific layout specifications, we ensure consistent, professional presentation that maintains visual impact and message clarity across all device types, directly supporting our message validation goals.

**Critical Implementation Note**: This story requires mandatory visual assessment before any layout changes are committed to version control. All CSS modifications must undergo comprehensive visual validation following the collaborative process defined in `.github/prompts/visual-assess.prompt.md`, which requires user-provided screenshots for proper assessment, to ensure layout quality and prevent visual regressions.

## User Story

So that I immediately understand Voder's value proposition regardless of my device, as a founder visiting the site, I want the initial viewport to present a perfectly balanced layout where the brand, visual element, and core message create a cohesive hierarchy that captures my attention and clearly communicates the solution without requiring scrolling.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Layout optimization can be implemented independently of other features
- **Negotiable**: Specific spacing ratios and element sizes can be refined through iteration
- **Valuable**: Directly improves first impression and message comprehension for validation
- **Estimable**: Clear scope with measurable spacing and positioning requirements
- **Small**: Focused on CSS layout optimization without new feature development
- **Testable**: Visual validation through screenshots and viewport testing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Desktop Visual-First Hero**: Large 3D cube (50%+ viewport) with minimal text creates maximum visual impact on 1920x1080 viewport
- [ ] **Tablet Visual Balance**: Cube maintains visual dominance while preserving impact in 768x1024 viewport constraints
- [ ] **Mobile Visual Impact**: 3D cube remains compelling focal point within 375x667 viewport while maintaining usability
