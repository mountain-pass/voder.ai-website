# 025.8-BIZ-CAUSTICS-FLOW: Flowing Light Ribbons

## Release Goal

_"Release 1.0: MVP Problem Validation - Create sophisticated 3D visual experience that demonstrates technical capability and validates the AI slop problem message"_

This story evolves the glass cube's volumetric caustics from scattered light spots into flowing, continuous light ribbons that create elegant streaming patterns throughout the cube's interior, enhancing the "clarity emerging from chaos" metaphor with graceful, directional flow that suggests purposeful transformation.

## How This Story Contributes

This story transforms the current scattered volumetric light spots into coherent, flowing light ribbons that stream through the cube's interior volume. These continuous light streams create a more sophisticated and purposeful visual effect, strengthening the core metaphor of "bringing clarity to chaos" by showing light organizing itself into meaningful patterns. The flowing ribbons suggest transformation and direction, moving beyond static beauty to convey a sense of process and emergence that better represents the brand's value proposition of turning complexity into clarity.

## User Story

So that I can experience a more sophisticated representation of "clarity emerging from chaos" through dynamic light movement, as a business user (founder/VC), I want the glass cube's volumetric caustics to display as animated flowing light ribbons that stream continuously through the interior, creating elegant directional patterns with smooth temporal flow that actively demonstrates transformation and purposeful organization.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

## Implementation Notes

### Pattern Evolution Strategy

**Previous State**: Scattered volumetric light spots created by ridge noise turbulence
**Implemented State**: Animated flowing light ribbons with temporal coherence and directional flow
**Approach**: Successfully evolved noise patterns into compound sinusoidal flow fields with time-based animation

### Potential Techniques

1. **Flow Field Enhancement** (Recommended)
   - Enhance existing ridge noise with directional flow fields
   - Use curl noise or vector field guidance for ribbon continuity
   - Pros: Builds on proven foundation, maintains performance
   - Cons: Requires flow field mathematics expertise

2. **Streamline Tracing**
   - Generate ribbon paths through 3D streamline tracing
   - Sample flow field at multiple points to create continuous paths
   - Pros: Mathematically elegant, highly controllable
   - Cons: More complex implementation, potential performance impact

3. **Layered Noise Combination**
   - Combine multiple noise layers with different frequencies for ribbon structure
   - Use noise modulation to create ribbon-like coherence from existing patterns
   - Pros: Easier modification of existing system
   - Cons: May not achieve true ribbon continuity

4. **Signed Distance Field Ribbons**
   - Use SDF techniques to define ribbon volumes within the cube
   - Combine multiple SDF ribbons for complex flowing patterns
   - Pros: Clean mathematical definition, good performance
   - Cons: Less organic than noise-based approaches

### Technical Considerations

- Maintain WebGL2 raymarching foundation for consistency and performance
- Preserve object-space coordinate transformation and depth handling
- Consider ribbon thickness and brightness modulation for visual appeal
- Balance pattern complexity with GPU shader limitations
- Ensure ribbon flow directions create visually pleasing compositions
- Test ribbon visibility and definition against dark glass material
