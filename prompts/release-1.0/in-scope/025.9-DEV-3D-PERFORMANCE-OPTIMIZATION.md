## Implementation Notes

### Root Cause Analysis

**Problem**: The current `causticPattern()` function in `src/three-animation.ts` (lines 500-580) performs excessive computational complexity:

- 15+ noise function calls per pixel per raymarching step
- 3 separate ribbon calculations with complex flow field computations
- Energy modulation and wave interference calculations
- Results in ~72 billion calculations per second at 60fps on desktop

**Solution Approach**: Multi-phase optimization targeting the computational bottleneck while preserving visual quality.

### Phase 1: Shader Optimization Strategy

```typescript
// Current: Complex causticPattern() function
function causticPattern(pos: vec3, time: number): number {
  // 15+ noise calls, complex flow fields, energy calculations
  // ~1,200 operations per pixel per raymarching step
}

// Optimized: Simplified causticPattern() function
function optimizedCausticPattern(
  pos: vec3,
  time: number,
  quality: QualityLevel,
): number {
  // 3-4 strategic noise calls with pre-computed lookup textures
  // ~200-400 operations per pixel per raymarching step (60-80% reduction)
}
```

### Phase 2: Quality Level Framework

```typescript
interface QualityLevel {
  rayMarchingSteps: number; // 8, 15, 25, or 40
  causticComplexity: number; // Noise call count: 2, 3, 4, or 6
  enableFlowFields: boolean; // Advanced flow calculations
  textureResolution: number; // Lookup texture quality
}

const QUALITY_PRESETS = {
  LOW: {
    rayMarchingSteps: 8,
    causticComplexity: 2,
    enableFlowFields: false,
    textureResolution: 64,
  },
  MEDIUM: {
    rayMarchingSteps: 15,
    causticComplexity: 3,
    enableFlowFields: true,
    textureResolution: 128,
  },
  HIGH: {
    rayMarchingSteps: 25,
    causticComplexity: 4,
    enableFlowFields: true,
    textureResolution: 256,
  },
  ULTRA: {
    rayMarchingSteps: 40,
    causticComplexity: 6,
    enableFlowFields: true,
    textureResolution: 512,
  },
};
```

### Phase 3: Performance Monitoring

```typescript
class PerformanceMonitor {
  private frameRateHistory: number[] = [];
  private currentQuality: QualityLevel = QUALITY_PRESETS.HIGH;

  monitorPerformance(): void {
    const fps = this.calculateFPS();
    this.frameRateHistory.push(fps);

    if (this.shouldDowngradeQuality(fps)) {
      this.downgradeQuality();
    } else if (this.shouldUpgradeQuality(fps)) {
      this.upgradeQuality();
    }
  }

  private shouldDowngradeQuality(fps: number): boolean {
    return fps < 45 && this.frameRateHistory.filter(f => f < 45).length > 5;
  }
}
