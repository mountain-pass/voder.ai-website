# BIZ-NARRATIVE-CONTENT-FOUNDATION: Static "Remember When" Content Display

## Release Goal

_"Release 1.0: MVP Problem Validation - Foundation Story 1/15 - Display static narrative content in natural document flow"_

Create the foundational "Remember when..." narrative content that displays correctly in natural document flow without any scroll-driven effects. This establishes the content foundation that subsequent stories will enhance with cinematic features.

## How This Story Contributes

This story provides the essential content foundation following Gall's Law - start with a simple system that works. The static narrative content must be compelling and correctly positioned before adding any scroll-driven or cinematic effects. This ensures the core message is effective even without JavaScript enhancements.
