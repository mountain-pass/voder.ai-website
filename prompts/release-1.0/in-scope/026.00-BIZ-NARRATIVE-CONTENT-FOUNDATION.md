# BIZ-NARRATIVE-CONTENT-FOUNDATION: Static "Remember When" Content Display

## Release Goal

_"Release 1.0: MVP Problem Validation - Foundation Story 1/15 - Display static narrative content in natural document flow"_

Create the foundational "Remember when..." narrative content that displays correctly in natural document flow without any scroll-driven effects. This establishes the content foundation that subsequent stories will enhance with cinematic features.

## How This Story Contributes

This story provides the essential content foundation following Gall's Law - start with a simple system that works. The static narrative content must be compelling and correctly positioned before adding any scroll-driven or cinematic effects. This ensures the core message is effective even without JavaScript enhancements.

## User Story

So that I can read the compelling "Remember when..." narrative about AI coding journey, as a founder visiting the site, I want to see the complete narrative content displayed clearly in the natural document flow between the problem section and email signup, ensuring the story is readable and impactful even without cinematic effects.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can be implemented standalone after 3D animation foundation
- **Negotiable**: Specific narrative text and styling can be refined
- **Valuable**: Provides compelling problem recognition content
- **Estimable**: Clear scope - static content display and basic styling

## Dependencies

- 025.0-BIZ-3D-ANIMATION (requires 3D animation section to be complete)

## Implementation Notes

### Content Structure Example

**Note: This content specification is indicative, not prescriptive. The actual narrative text can be refined and adapted while maintaining the emotional arc and technical requirements.**

```html
<section class="narrative-content">
  <!-- Act 1: Magic Phase (0-20% scroll range) -->
  <div class="narrative-segment" data-act="1" data-segment="1">
    <p>
      Remember when AI coding felt like <span class="magic-word">magic</span>?
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="narrative-segment" data-act="1" data-segment="2">
    <p>
      When shipping features was
      <span class="speed-word">fast and exciting</span>?
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Act 2: Peak Momentum (20-40% scroll range) -->
  <div class="narrative-segment" data-act="2" data-segment="3">
    <p>You showed it to your team. You posted about it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="narrative-segment" data-act="2" data-segment="4">
    <p>
      Features <span class="flew-word">flew</span> into production. You felt
      <span class="unstoppable-word">unstoppable</span>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Act 3: The Turn (40-60% scroll range) -->
  <div class="narrative-segment" data-act="3" data-segment="5">
    <p>Then it <span class="happened-phrase">happened</span>...</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Act 4: Chaos (60-80% scroll range) -->
  <div class="narrative-segment" data-act="4" data-segment="6">
    <p>
      Your codebase became a <span class="nightmare-word">nightmare</span>.
      Nothing works, everything's <span class="broken-word">broken</span>.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Act 5: Reality (80-100% scroll range) -->
  <div class="narrative-segment" data-act="5" data-segment="7">
    <p>
      The excitement turned to <span class="dread-word">dread</span>. Magic
      became <span class="quicksand-word">quicksand</span>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="narrative-segment" data-act="5" data-segment="8">
    <p>
      Now you're
      <span class="stuck-phrase">stuck cleaning up the mess</span> while your
      competitors actually ship features.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>
```

### Complete Narrative Content (Indicative)

**Act 1: Magic Phase**

- Segment 1: "Remember when AI coding felt like magic?"
- Segment 2: "When shipping features was fast and exciting?"

**Act 2: Peak Momentum**

- Segment 3: "You showed it to your team. You posted about it."
- Segment 4: "Features flew into production. You felt unstoppable."

**Act 3: The Turn**

- Segment 5: "Then it happened..."

**Act 4: Chaos**

- Segment 6: "Your codebase became a nightmare. Nothing works, everything's broken."

**Act 5: Reality**

- Segment 7: "The excitement turned to dread. Magic became quicksand."
- Segment 8: "Now you're stuck cleaning up the mess while your competitors actually ship features."

### Emotional Keywords for Future Enhancement

The following words receive special treatment for future cinematic effects:

- **Magic words**: `magic` (warm glow effects)
- **Speed words**: `fast`, `exciting`, `flew` (energy effects)
- **Peak words**: `unstoppable` (confident scaling)
- **Turn words**: `happened` (dramatic pause)
- **Chaos words**: `nightmare`, `broken` (aggressive motion, error styling)
- **Reality words**: `dread`, `quicksand`, `stuck` (heavy, sinking motion)

### Styling Approach

```css
.narrative-content {
  /* Natural document flow positioning with full viewport height */
  height: 100vh;
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 2rem;
  line-height: 1.6;
  /* Ensure content is centered vertically within the viewport */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
}

.narrative-segment {
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  color: var(--text-primary);
}

.magic-word,
.speed-word,
.flew-word,
.unstoppable-word,
.happened-phrase,
.nightmare-word,
.broken-word,
.dread-word,
.quicksand-word,
.stuck-phrase {
  /* Subtle highlighting for future enhancement */
  font-weight: 600;
  color: var(--accent-teal);
}
```

### Viewport Height Rationale

The 100vh container height is essential for the future scroll-driven cinematic experience:

- **Consistent Timeline**: Ensures users have adequate scroll distance for timeline scrubbing regardless of device aspect ratio
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Works consistently across phones (16:9, 18:9, 19.5:9), tablets, and desktops
- **Cinematic Foundation**: Provides the spatial foundation needed for viewport-fixed overlay effects in later stories
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Container is properly sized even before scroll detection and animations are added

### Success Criteria

- Content is immediately visible and readable
- Typography feels professional and engaging
- Text flows naturally in document layout
- Container provides full viewport height for future scroll enhancements
- Foundation ready for scroll-driven enhancements
- Passes visual quality assessment

This foundational story ensures the narrative content works perfectly before adding any complex scroll-driven or cinematic effects.
