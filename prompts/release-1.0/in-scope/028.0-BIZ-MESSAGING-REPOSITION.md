# 028.0-BIZ-SPEC-DRIVEN-STORY-MAPS: Story Maps Communicate Spec-Driven Autonomous Delivery

## Release Goal

_"Release 1.0: MVP Problem Validation - Story maps communicate spec-driven autonomous delivery positioning to target personas"_

User story maps (business, developer, product owner, autonomous delivery) and startup engine analysis communicate Voder's positioning as spec-driven autonomous delivery through structured specifications, using the GPS metaphor and emphasizing benefits of traceability, reproducibility, and platform portability rather than problem-only "AI slop" messaging.

## How This Story Contributes

Spec-driven positioning in story maps is critical for Release 1.0 as it:

- Provides solution-focused positioning for all personas
- Establishes clear differentiation from vibe-coding approaches
- Creates foundation for autonomous delivery platform narrative
- Aligns business, developer, and product owner journeys with unified vision
- Enables effective communication with investors, founders, and technical decision-makers

## User Story

So that I can clearly communicate Voder's competitive advantage to investors and customers, as a **Founder/Product Leader**, I want our story maps to communicate spec-driven autonomous delivery positioning consistently across all personas.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can update messaging independently of technical implementation
- **Negotiable**: Specific wording and metaphors can be refined based on feedback
- **Valuable**: Clear positioning drives investor interest and customer acquisition
- **Estimable**: Messaging updates to story maps are bounded and clear
- **Small**: Focused on story map narrative updates, not full website rewrite
- **Testable**: Success measured by message clarity and stakeholder feedback

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **Business Story Map**: Journey phases guide from intrigue to spec-driven solution understanding
- [x] **Developer Story Map**: Workflow emphasizes Write Specs → Compile → Validate pattern
- [x] **Product Owner Story Map**: Strategic workflow reflects intent capture and autonomous execution
- [x] **Autonomous Delivery Map**: Comprehensive journey map exists for end-to-end autonomous delivery
- [x] **Startup Engine Analysis**: Competitive hypothesis and LinkedIn posts reflect spec-driven positioning
- [x] **GPS Metaphor**: Specs as destination vs code as turn-by-turn directions used consistently
- [x] **Secondary Personas**: CTOs, Platform Engineering Leaders, Portfolio Managers included
- [x] **Consistent Terminology**: "Vibe coding," "massive PRs," and "reviewer burnout" describe the problem we solve
- [x] **Traceability Benefits**: All maps emphasize traceability, reproducibility, and platform portability
- [x] **Value Propositions**: Each persona understands their specific benefits from spec-driven approach

- **REQ-AUTO-VALUE-PROPS**: Traceability, Reproducibility, Platform Portability, Sustainable Velocity
- **REQ-AUTO-GPS-METAPHOR**: GPS metaphor central to narrative (specs = destination, compiler = route)
- **REQ-AUTO-BENEFITS**: Each persona has clear, specific benefits documented
- **REQ-AUTO-INTEGRATION**: Shows integration with Business/Developer/PO story maps
- **REQ-AUTO-METRICS**: Success metrics defined for each release phase

### Startup Engine Analysis Requirements

- **REQ-ENGINE-GPS**: GPS metaphor integrated throughout analysis
- **REQ-ENGINE-RELEASE-2**: Release 2 includes autonomous delivery validation

### Consistency Requirements

- **REQ-CONSISTENCY-TONE**: Concise, empathetic tone across all story maps
- **REQ-CONSISTENCY-TERMINOLOGY**: Consistent use of "vibe coding," "spec-driven," "autonomous delivery"
- **REQ-CONSISTENCY-METAPHORS**: GPS metaphor used consistently to explain spec-driven approach
- **REQ-CONSISTENCY-BENEFITS**: Same three core benefits emphasized: traceability, reproducibility, portability
- **REQ-CONSISTENCY-FORMATTING**: Consistent headings, bullet points, tables across all files

## Dependencies

- 001.0-PO-STORY-MANAGEMENT (requires story management framework)
- 020.0-BIZ-PROBLEM-SPACE (builds on existing problem messaging)
- All existing Release 0.5 and 1.0 stories (provides context for repositioning)

## Implementation Notes

**Files Updated:**

1. `prompts/business-user-story-map.md` - Business journey and personas updated
2. `prompts/developer-user-story-map.md` - Developer workflow and spec emphasis added
3. `prompts/product-owner-user-story-map.md` - Strategic workflow reframed
4. `prompts/autonomous-delivery-user-story-map.md` - New comprehensive map created
5. `prompts/startup-engine-analysis.md` - Competitive positioning and LinkedIn posts added

**Key Messaging Elements:**

- **Problem**: Vibe coding without structured specs leads to fragile codebases, massive PRs, reviewer burnout
- **Solution**: Spec-driven development with autonomous compilation prevents AI slop
- **Metaphor**: GPS (specs provide destination) vs turn-by-turn directions (code shows route)
- **Benefits**: Traceability (intent → spec → code), Reproducibility (deterministic builds), Portability (swap frameworks)

**Target Personas:**

- **VCs**: Evaluating investment opportunity in spec-driven tooling
- **Founders**: Seeking sustainable AI-assisted development
- **CTOs/Engineering Managers**: Concerned about technical debt and team burnout
- **Platform Engineers**: Scaling AI development across teams
- **Product Owners**: Defining intent without implementation coupling
