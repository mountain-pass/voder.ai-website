# 029.0-PO-DEV-STORY-CONSISTENT-MESSAGING: Developer Infrastructure Stories Reference Spec-Driven Delivery

## Release Goal

_"Release 1.0: MVP Problem Validation - Developer infrastructure story documentation consistently references spec-driven autonomous delivery demonstration"_

Developer infrastructure stories (002.0-012.1) consistently reference "spec-driven autonomous delivery demonstration website" in their Release Goal context, maintaining documentation consistency with current product positioning while preserving the completed implementation status of the underlying work.

## How This Story Contributes

Consistent terminology across all developer infrastructure story documentation ensures product owners, developers, and stakeholders understand the current context and purpose of the website's quality infrastructure without confusion from outdated "AI slop problem validation" framing.

## User Story

So that I understand the current context for our development infrastructure in consistent terms, as a **Product Owner**, I want developer infrastructure story documentation to reference spec-driven autonomous delivery demonstration consistently.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can update story documentation independently of code changes
- **Negotiable**: Specific wording can be refined while maintaining core message
- **Valuable**: Consistent documentation prevents confusion and maintains professional standards
- **Estimable**: Clear list of 8 stories with identical update pattern
- **Small**: Simple find-replace operation across known files
- **Testable**: Success measured by grep search showing no remaining old references

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **Story 002.0-DEV-ENV-NODE.md**: Release Goal references "spec-driven autonomous delivery demonstration website"
- [x] **Story 003.0-DEV-ENV-DEPS.md**: Release Goal references "spec-driven autonomous delivery demonstration website"
- [x] **Story 004.0-DEV-TYPESCRIPT.md**: Release Goal references "spec-driven autonomous delivery demonstration website"
- [x] **Story 006.0-DEV-FORMAT.md**: Release Goal references "spec-driven autonomous delivery demonstration website"

- [x] **Story 011.0-DEV-TEST-UNIT.md**: Release Goal references "spec-driven autonomous delivery demonstration website"
- [x] **Story 012.0-DEV-TEST-COVERAGE.md**: Release Goal references "spec-driven autonomous delivery demonstration website"
- [x] **Story 012.1-DEV-GIT-HOOKS.md**: Release Goal references "spec-driven autonomous delivery demonstration website"
- [x] **Story 005.0-DEV-BUILD.md**: Contains "spec-driven autonomous delivery demonstration website" (no "vite rot" typo)
- [x] **No old references**: No "AI slop problem validation website" appears in dev stories

## Requirements

### Story Update Requirements

- **REQ-CONSISTENT-TERMINOLOGY**: All updated stories use "spec-driven autonomous delivery demonstration website"
- **REQ-PRESERVE-IMPLEMENTATION**: No changes to acceptance criteria, requirements, or DoD (work is complete)
- **REQ-RELEASE-GOAL-ONLY**: Updates limited to "How This Contributes" section within Release Goal
- **REQ-IDENTICAL-PATTERN**: All 8 stories follow same replacement pattern for consistency

### Quality Requirements

- **REQ-NO-CODE-CHANGES**: No source code changes required (documentation only)
- **REQ-VERIFICATION**: Automated grep search to confirm all old references removed
- **REQ-TYPO-FIX**: Correct "vite rot" typo in story 005.0-DEV-BUILD.md
- **REQ-COMMIT-SEPARATELY**: Story updates committed separately from code changes

### Affected Stories List

**Pattern to Replace:**

```
"ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the AI slop problem validation website"
```

**Replace With:**

```
"ensuring developers can write high-quality code efficiently for the spec-driven autonomous delivery demonstration website"
```

**Stories Requiring Update:**

1. `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/002.0-DEV-ENV-NODE.md`
2. `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/003.0-DEV-ENV-DEPS.md`
3. `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/004.0-DEV-TYPESCRIPT.md`
4. `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/005.0-DEV-BUILD.md` (also fix "vite rot" typo)
5. `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/006.0-DEV-FORMAT.md`
6. `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/007.0-DEV-LINT-CSS.md`
7. `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/008.0-DEV-LINT-HTML.md`
8. `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/009.0-DEV-LINT-MD.md`
9. `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/010.0-DEV-LINT-JS.md`
10. `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/011.0-DEV-TEST-UNIT.md`
11. `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/012.0-DEV-TEST-COVERAGE.md`
12. `prompts/release-0.5/in-scope/012.1-DEV-GIT-HOOKS.md`

## Dependencies

- 028.0-BIZ-MESSAGING-REPOSITION (requires new messaging framework established)

## Implementation Notes

This is a documentation-only update with no code changes required. The actual development work documented in these stories is complete and correct - only the contextual framing in the Release Goal section needs updating to match current positioning.

**Implementation Approach:**

1. Use multi_replace_string_in_file for batch updates
2. Handle story 005.0 separately to fix typo
3. Run grep verification to confirm all updates
4. Commit with message: `docs(stories): update dev infrastructure stories to spec-driven messaging`

## Definition of Done

- [x] All 12 developer infrastructure stories updated with new messaging
- [x] Typo in story 005.0 corrected
- [x] Grep search confirms no remaining "AI slop problem validation website" references in dev stories
- [x] Changes committed to repository
- [x] Changes deployed to production
- [x] No linting or formatting issues introduced

---

**Implementation Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

All developer infrastructure stories have been updated to reference "spec-driven autonomous delivery demonstration website" instead of "AI slop problem validation website". Typo in story 005.0 has been corrected.
