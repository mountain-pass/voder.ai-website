# 031.0-BIZ-SOFTWARE-INTENT-NARRATIVE: Software Intent Story Bridges Vibe Coding Crisis to Spec-Driven Solution

## Release Goal

_"Release 1.0: MVP Problem Validation - Software intent narrative bridges vibe coding crisis to spec-driven autonomous delivery solution"_

Story 027.0-BIZ-SOFTWARE-INTENT provides a clear narrative bridge from vibe coding crisis (fragile codebases, massive PRs, reviewer burnout) to spec-driven autonomous delivery solution, using the GPS metaphor to explain how structured specifications prevent the problems founders recognize from their own experience.

## How This Story Contributes

The software intent narrative is the critical conversion moment where website visitors move from problem recognition to solution understanding. A coherent bridge using current spec-driven positioning (not outdated "AI slop" framing) ensures founders see autonomous delivery as the inevitable solution to their vibe coding crisis.

## User Story

So that I understand how spec-driven development prevents the vibe coding problems I'm experiencing, as a **Founder/Business User**, I want to see a clear narrative that bridges from my current pain (fragile codebases, massive PRs, reviewer burnout) to spec-driven autonomous delivery as the systematic solution.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can rewrite story narrative independently of implementation
- **Negotiable**: Specific bridge metaphors and examples can be refined
- **Valuable**: Correct narrative bridge is essential for website conversion
- **Estimable**: Single story rewrite with clear scope
- **Small**: One story file update (though narrative is complex)
- **Testable**: Success measured by coherent problem-to-solution bridge using current positioning

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Release Goal**: Reflects spec-driven autonomous delivery positioning
- [ ] **Problem framing**: Uses "vibe coding crisis" terminology (massive PRs, reviewer burnout, fragile codebases)
- [ ] **Solution framing**: Emphasizes spec-driven development and autonomous compilation
- [ ] **Bridge narrative**: Clear progression from vibe coding problems to spec-driven benefits
- [ ] **GPS metaphor**: Specs as destination vs code as turn-by-turn directions
- [ ] **User Story**: Reflects problem-solution bridge
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: Test correct narrative flow with current positioning
- [ ] **Requirements**: REQ-\* statements align with spec-driven messaging
- [ ] **Benefits**: Traceability, reproducibility, platform portability emphasized
- [ ] **No AI slop references**: All old messaging removed

## Requirements

### Narrative Bridge Requirements

- **REQ-PROBLEM-START**: Narrative starts with vibe coding crisis recognition
- **REQ-PAIN-ARTICULATION**: Massive PRs, reviewer burnout, and fragile codebases clearly described
- **REQ-SOLUTION-INTRO**: Spec-driven development introduced as systematic alternative
- **REQ-BRIDGE-MECHANISM**: Clear explanation of HOW specs prevent vibe coding problems
- **REQ-AUTONOMOUS-DELIVERY**: Autonomous compilation and delivery explained
- **REQ-GPS-METAPHOR**: GPS metaphor used to clarify specs vs code relationship

### Content Requirements

- **REQ-VIBE-CODING-DEFINITION**: Clear definition of vibe coding and why it fails
- **REQ-SPEC-DRIVEN-BENEFITS**: Three core benefits articulated (traceability, reproducibility, portability)
- **REQ-INTENT-CAPTURE**: Explanation of how specs capture intent without coupling to implementation
- **REQ-COMPILATION-CONCEPT**: Introduction to autonomous compilation pipeline concept
- **REQ-WORKFLOW-PREVIEW**: Preview of spec-driven workflow (Write Specs → Compile → Validate)

### Quality Requirements

- **REQ-COHERENT-NARRATIVE**: Story flows logically from problem through bridge to solution
- **REQ-FOUNDER-PERSPECTIVE**: Narrative resonates with founders/business users experiencing vibe coding crisis
- **REQ-CREDIBLE-BRIDGE**: Bridge from problem to solution feels inevitable, not forced
- **REQ-ACTION-ORIENTED**: Narrative leads to clear next action (explore spec-driven approach)
- **REQ-CONSISTENT-TERMINOLOGY**: All messaging aligns with updated story maps

### Story Rewrite Scope

**Current Story 027.0-BIZ-SOFTWARE-INTENT.md:**

- **Problem framing**: "AI slop problem" (OLD)
- **Bridge mechanism**: Problem → solution approach (VAGUE)
- **Solution framing**: Unclear/outdated
- **Status**: Needs MAJOR rewrite, not update

**New Story Requirements:**

- **Problem framing**: Vibe coding crisis → fragile codebases, massive PRs, burnout
- **Bridge mechanism**: Spec-driven intent capture → autonomous compilation → prevent slop
- **Solution framing**: Spec-driven autonomous delivery with three core benefits
- **GPS metaphor**: Specs provide destination, compiler finds route
- **Workflow preview**: Write Specs → Compile → Validate cycle

## Dependencies

- 028.0-BIZ-MESSAGING-REPOSITION (requires new messaging framework)
- 029.0-PO-UPDATE-DEV-STORY-MESSAGING (provides consistent dev infrastructure context)
- 030.0-PO-UPDATE-ANALYTICS-STORY-MESSAGING (provides consistent analytics context)

## Implementation Notes

This is NOT a find-replace operation. Story 027.0-BIZ-SOFTWARE-INTENT requires a complete narrative rewrite because:

1. **Old bridge**: "AI slop problem" → generic "solution approach"
2. **New bridge**: "Vibe coding crisis" → "spec-driven autonomous delivery" with GPS metaphor

The bridge mechanism itself has changed - we're no longer just describing a problem and hinting at solutions, we're explaining WHW spec-driven development systematically prevents vibe coding failures.

**Rewrite Approach:**

1. Review current story 027.0 to understand original intent
2. Review autonomous-delivery-user-story-map.md for new narrative structure
3. Draft new Release Goal, User Story, and Acceptance Criteria
4. Rewrite Requirements to reflect spec-driven bridge
5. Update Implementation Notes and DoD
6. Verify story follows INVEST criteria
7. Commit as: `docs(stories): rewrite software intent story for spec-driven positioning`

**Key Narrative Elements:**

- **Hook**: "Remember when..." (vibe coding failures)
- **Problem**: Massive PRs nobody can review, fragile codebases, constant rework
- **Insight**: Problem isn't AI - it's lack of structured intent
- **Bridge**: Specs capture WHAT (destination) without HOW (route)
- **Solution**: Autonomous compilation executes against specs
- **Benefits**: Traceability, reproducibility, platform portability
- **CTA**: Explore spec-driven workflow

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Story 027.0-BIZ-SOFTWARE-INTENT.md completely rewritten
- [ ] Narrative flows from vibe coding crisis to spec-driven solution
- [ ] GPS metaphor integrated throughout
- [ ] All "AI slop" references removed
- [ ] INVEST criteria compliance verified
- [ ] Story aligns with autonomous-delivery-user-story-map.md
- [ ] Changes committed to repository
- [ ] Changes deployed to production
- [ ] No linting or formatting issues introduced
- [ ] Peer review confirms narrative bridge is compelling

**Implementation Status**: ⏳ PENDING

This story requires complete rewrite, not simple updates. The narrative bridge is the foundation for website conversion effectiveness.
