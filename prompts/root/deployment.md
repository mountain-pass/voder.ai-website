# Application Deployment & CI/CD Guidelines

## 📋 **DEPLOYMENT OVERVIEW**

**Scope:** Application-level deployment and CI/CD pipeline management  
**Purpose:** Define deployment standards for complete applications (not individual packages)  
**Target:** Root-level deployment processes and application orchestration  

## 🔄 **CI/CD PIPELINE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Automated Testing Pipeline**
All tests must pass before deployment:
- **Unit tests**: Individual package tests must pass
- **Integration tests**: Cross-package integration validation
- **End-to-end tests**: Complete application flow testing
- **Performance tests**: Lighthouse CI scores must meet thresholds
- **Accessibility tests**: axe-core compliance validation

### **Visual Regression Testing**
- **Screenshot comparisons**: UI component visual validation
- **Cross-browser testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility
- **Responsive testing**: Multiple viewport size validation
- **Animation verification**: Key animation frame capture
- **Accessibility states**: Focus and interaction state documentation

### **Build Verification**
- **Production build**: Successful build completion required
- **Bundle analysis**: Size and dependency validation
- **Asset optimization**: Image, font, and 3D model optimization
- **Performance budgets**: Bundle size and load time limits
- **Security scanning**: Dependency vulnerability checks

## 🔀 **GIT WORKFLOW STANDARDS**

### **Branch Protection Rules**
- **Main branch protection**: All changes via pull requests
- **Required reviews**: Code review mandatory before merge
- **Status checks**: CI/CD pipeline must pass completely
- **Linear history**: Merge or rebase strategy enforcement

### **Development Workflow**
- **Commit frequency**: Code MUST be committed frequently. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
- **Commit triggers**: When the tests pass, you MUST commit
- **File count triggers**: IF THERE ARE more than 5 modified or untracked files, you MUST plan to commit NOW!
- **History triggers**: IF none of the last 5 actions in the history are a commit, you MUST plan to commit NOW!
- **Push requirements**: If there are un-pushed commits, you MUST plan to push NOW! If it's not safe, you MUST plan NOW to make the changes so that it is safe to push!
- **Commit messages**: Conventional commit format preferred
- **Feature branches**: Short-lived branches for features/fixes
- **Documentation updates**: Keep docs current with changes

### **Process Management**
- **Background processes**: DO NOT KEEP PROCESSES RUNNING LONGER THAN NECESSARY. IF YOU NO LONGER HAVE A NEED FOR A PROCESS, YOU MUST PLAN TO STOP IT NOW!
- **Testing output**: Record linting and testing output in `outputs/`, but do NOT commit them
- **File cleanup**: YOU MUST DELETE THE FILES `outputs/` WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER NEEDED

### **Completion Requirements**
- **YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL ALL THE CHANGES ARE COMMITTED AND PUSHED**

### **Release Process**
- **Version tagging**: Semantic versioning for releases
- **Release notes**: Automated changelog generation
- **Deployment approval**: Manual approval for production deployments
- **Rollback strategy**: Quick rollback capability for issues

## 📸 **VISUAL VALIDATION PROCESS**

### **Screenshot Requirements**
Document visual states for testing and validation:
- **Component states**: Initial, hover, focus, active, disabled
- **User flows**: Key steps in user interaction flows
- **Error states**: Error messages and fallback displays
- **Loading states**: Skeleton screens and loading indicators

### **Cross-Platform Testing**
- **Browser compatibility**: Automated testing across major browsers
- **Device testing**: Mobile, tablet, desktop viewport testing
- **Performance validation**: Real device performance testing
- **Accessibility validation**: Screen reader and keyboard testing

### **Animation Documentation**
- **Animation sequences**: Key frames for complex animations
- **Transition states**: Before, during, after transition captures
- **Performance monitoring**: FPS and smoothness validation
- **Reduced motion**: Alternative animations for accessibility

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENTS**

### **Development Environment**
- **Hot reloading**: Instant development feedback
- **Debug tools**: Enhanced logging and debugging
- **Mock services**: Local development service mocking
- **Feature flags**: Development-only feature toggles

### **Staging Environment**
- **Production parity**: Mirror production configuration
- **Integration testing**: Full integration test execution
- **Performance testing**: Real-world performance validation
- **User acceptance**: Stakeholder review and approval

### **Production Environment**
- **CDN optimization**: Asset delivery optimization
- **Compression**: Gzip/Brotli compression enabled
- **Caching strategies**: Appropriate cache headers
- **Monitoring**: Real-time error and performance tracking
- **Scaling**: Auto-scaling for traffic spikes

## 📊 **MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY**

### **Application Performance Monitoring**
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS tracking
- **Custom metrics**: Business-specific performance indicators
- **Error tracking**: Real-time error monitoring and alerting
- **User experience**: Session replay and user journey tracking

### **Infrastructure Monitoring**
- **Server health**: Resource usage and availability
- **CDN performance**: Asset delivery performance
- **Database performance**: Query performance and optimization
- **Third-party services**: External service dependency monitoring

## 🔒 **SECURITY & COMPLIANCE**

### **Security Pipeline**
- **Dependency scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Code scanning**: Static security analysis
- **Secrets management**: Secure credential handling
- **Access control**: Role-based deployment permissions

### **Compliance Requirements**
- **WCAG compliance**: Accessibility standard adherence
- **Privacy compliance**: Data protection requirements
- **Performance standards**: Speed and efficiency requirements
- **SEO compliance**: Search engine optimization validation
