# 🏗️ Narrative Structure (Scroll or Scene-Based)

| Section                        | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Brand Entry**             | Voder logo intro with glowing motion or orbiting 3D object (e.g. prompt cube). No CTA, just intrigue. |
| **2. The Why**                 | Purpose-driven statement: “We believe software should start with intent…”                             |
| **3. Problem Space**           | Framing of the bottlenecks in traditional dev workflows — complexity, fragmentation, low abstraction  |
| **4. Metaphor**                | GPS vs Passenger metaphor: traditional tools give directions; Voder drives you where you want to go   |
| **5. Vision Flow**             | Conceptual diagram or animation: `Source Prompts → Voder → Application Code → Working Product`        |
| **6. Prompt-Driven Iteration** | Showcase how Voder updates code intelligently when prompts change — highlight diff-like adaptation    |
| **7. Outcome Focus**           | What Voder enables: faster delivery, brand-consistent UX, fewer manual bottlenecks                    |
| **8. Closing Moment**          | Signature phrase: “The Compiler for Prompts.” + “Coming Soon.” — fades to black or abstract finish    |
