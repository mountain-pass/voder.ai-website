# 🎬 Transition: The Why → Problem Space

## End of "The Why"

The belief statement is now visible:

“We believe software should start with intent.”

Background is calm, minimal — a soft glow or morphing abstract shape

Subtle particle field floats behind text

## Scroll Begins

As the user scrolls, the background begins to darken — slowly at first

The belief text blurs and drifts upward, like it's dissolving into memory

Ambient tone shifts — a soft dissonance or distortion cue begins (optional audio layer)

## Problem Visual Emerges

A dense web of code fragments, diagrams, arrows, and overlays begins to fade in
(Think: scattered .tsx, webpack.config.js, storybook snapshots, design tokens…)

They float chaotically, colliding or swirling around one another

Possibly rendered as 3D fragments or layered SVG clusters with parallax movement

## Copy Appears

Large bold heading fades in:

“The problem isn’t your tools.”

Followed by:

“It’s the gap between your ideas and your implementation.”

Subtext gently slides in or fades up:

“Developers stitch together frameworks, boilerplate, and brittle glue code — all to approximate what you actually meant.”

## Motion & Atmosphere

Visual noise increases slightly (but not annoyingly)

Parallax responds to mouse movement or scroll

Light desaturation or grain overlay can suggest messiness or friction

## ✨ Mood Shift Summary

| From                | To                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Calm, clean belief  | Dense, fractured noise |
| Bright-on-dark fade | Desaturated darks      |
| Stillness           | Subtle unease          |
| Hopeful             | Honest tension         |
