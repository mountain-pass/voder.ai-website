# 🎬 Transition: Metaphor → Vision Flow

## Settled Metaphor

The metaphor line:

“You’ve been in the passenger seat.”
has fully rendered on screen.

A minimal illustration shows a journey path or flowing route — labelled "Idea", "Design", "Code", "Ship".

## Scroll Initiates Transition

As the user scrolls:

The path begins to morph into a schematic, softly abstracting into nodes and flows

Headline fades out as the diagram begins to expand and occupy more screen space

## Scene Opens Up

Background lightens or subtly pulses

A flow diagram animates in:

```text
Source Prompts
      ↓
    Voder
      ↓
 Application Code
      ↓
 Working Product
```

Elements draw in live, like a system booting or idea taking form

## Text Layers In

Labels animate onto each node:

"Intent lives in markdown prompts."

"Voder interprets and compiles your vision."

"Code is written, structured, and versioned — for real."

## Atmospheric Effects

Thin pulses or connection lines animate between nodes

Mouse hover may reveal micro-explanations (optional)

A subtle looping animation keeps it alive without distracting

## ✨ Mood and Functional Shift

| From                      | To                           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Philosophical metaphor    | Concrete architecture        |
| Journey/experience visual | Input–Process–Output diagram |
| Emotional                 | Practical                    |
| “Why this matters”        | “How it works”               |
