# 🎬 Transition: Vision Flow → Prompt-Driven Iteration

## Vision Flow Settles

The schematic is now fully visible:

```text
Source Prompts
      ↓
    Voder
      ↓
 Application Code
      ↓
 Working Product
```

Each node may glow softly or animate in subtle loops

Final line ("Working Product") pulses once or gently fades into background

## Scroll Initiates Transition

The entire diagram subtly zooms out and blurs, becoming a background motif.

The central text block:

“Source Prompts”
softly separates and elevates, becoming the focal point.

## Prompt Appears

A stylised prompt panel fades in, with soft UI-like chrome.
Content reads:

```text
Tone: Casual, confident, modern.
```

The visual to the right shows a product UI (hero section, button, copy) with:

“Let’s get you started!”

Rounded button, bright accent colour

## Prompt Changes

The panel updates live:

```text
Tone: Premium, minimalist.
```

The product UI automatically morphs:

Headline becomes “Begin your journey.”

Button is slimmer, more reserved

Colour palette shifts to muted neutrals

## Headline Appears

“Change the prompt. Not the team.”

Subtext:

“With Voder, your intent drives product delivery. No briefs. No handoffs. No misalignment.”

## Atmospheric Design

Warm, focused lighting on UI

Background darkens subtly again to isolate the moment

Optional hover reveals for other prompt examples:
    - "Dark mode" → auto theme shift
    - "Use our new logo" → logo swaps instantly
