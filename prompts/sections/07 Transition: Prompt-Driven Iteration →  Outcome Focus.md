# 🎬 Transition: Prompt-Driven Iteration → Outcome Focus

## Prompt Interaction Settles

The last visual shows the prompt edit:

```text
Tone: Premium, minimalist.
```

…and the resulting UI update has just completed.

Text on screen:

“Change the prompt. Not the team.”

Everything pauses for a brief moment — a breath.

## Scroll Initiates Transition

The prompt panel fades into the background, becoming translucent

The UI mockup gently zooms out and dims, as if moving from a specific to a general view

A series of short, benefit-driven headlines begin to fade in, one by one:

## Outcome Highlights Appear

Each line animates in with confidence, one after another:

🚀 Deliver faster without losing control
🎯 Align product, brand, and tech from day one
💡 Iterate on ideas, not implementations
🔄 Make fewer handoffs. Create fewer misunderstandings.

## Visual Context

These headlines float over a collage of concept visuals:

- A design system tile auto-updating
- A team dashboard showing “updated from prompt change”
- A timeline with shorter dev cycles

Or, alternatively, they float against a dark background with soft light rays, keeping it focused and premium

## Headline Anchors the Section

After the benefits cycle in, a final header fades in:

“Outcomes, not overhead.”

Subtext:

“Voder bridges the gap between strategy and shipping — without adding layers, delays, or drift.”
