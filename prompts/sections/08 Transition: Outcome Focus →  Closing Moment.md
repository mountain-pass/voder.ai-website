# 🎬 Transition: Outcome Focus → Closing Moment

## Last Outcome Settles

Final line fades in:

“Outcomes, not overhead.”

Supporting copy:

“Voder bridges the gap between strategy and shipping — without adding layers, delays, or drift.”

Background is still warm and confident, maybe a spotlighted vignette or minimal collage.

## Scroll Initiates Fade to Black

Text fades out one line at a time

The background begins to darken slowly, like a stage curtain falling

A soft musical note or hush (optional) signals a final transition

## Logo Re-Emerges

The Voder logo fades back in, centred

Possibly pulsing with the same glow from the opening scene

Simple headline appears:

“The Compiler for Prompts.”

Below it, a single elegant line of text types in slowly:

Coming soon.

## The Reveal (Built With Voder)

Now to answer your key question: how do we show that the site was made with Voder?

🎯 Best move: subtle, confident nod — not a hero moment

In the bottom corner, a small glimmer of light draws attention

A footer tag fades in:

“Built with Voder”
(Of course.)

The “(Of course.)” optionally fades in a moment later — dry, self-aware, confident

Hovering could optionally expand it into a little tooltip:

This entire site — layout, animation, copy, interactions — was described in prompt files. Voder did the rest.

## Optional Loop or Exit

Idle state settles into subtle ambient motion or returns to the logo orb from the opening

Or, a scroll back-to-top cue appears after a delay

## ✨ Mood and Narrative Arc

| Element            | Function                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Fade to black      | Signals a conclusion, emotional resolution |
| Logo + headline    | Brand imprint and clarity                  |
| “Built with Voder” | Proof point, credibility, and elegance     |
| Stillness          | Space for reflection, minimal CTA          |
