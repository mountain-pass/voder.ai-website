# Voder Pre-Launch Website Specification (Audience Shift: Decision Makers, Founders, Product Leaders)

The **voder.ai** website is a **minimalist, single-page, pre-launch site** designed to generate intrigue without revealing detailed product information.

## 🎯 Purpose

The website exists to signal that something significant is coming in the world of software creation and delivery. It creates a sense of mystery and anticipation while hinting at a fundamental shift in how applications will be built in the future.

## 👥 Audience

The website is intended for:

- Founders and Product Leaders
- CTOs and Engineering Managers
- Creators, innovators, and problem solvers who fund or shape software projects
- Decision-makers who care about speed to market, quality, and alignment between business vision and software delivery

The tone and content are crafted to resonate with people who **pay for software to get built**, not necessarily the developers themselves.

## ✨ Tone and Feel

The tone of the site is:

- Visionary  
- Outcome-focused  
- Strategic  
- Minimalist  
- Conceptual  

The language is declarative, crisp, and designed to speak to business needs, not technical features.

## 🎨 Visual Design (Updated for Decision Makers)

| Element | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Colour palette** | Dark mode remains the default. Backgrounds in black or deep grey with executive-level accent colours: deep blues, metallic greys, or muted purples. Neon tones (if used) should be minimal and subtle. |
| **Typography** | Modern, clean sans-serif fonts with strong typographic hierarchy. Headings should feel bold and strategic. |
| **Imagery** | Conceptual vector graphics and abstract flow diagrams that represent business value flows, strategic alignment, or "vision-to-execution" pathways. |
| **Animation** | Professional and subtle. Smooth fades, slide-ins, progress animations. Avoid glitch or terminal-style effects that feel overly technical. |
| **Spacing and Layout** | Generous whitespace. Balanced layout that feels premium and intentional. |
| **Tone of Dark Mode** | Executive, SaaS-like, and product innovation-oriented. Not hacker or CLI-themed. |

## 🏗️ Information Architecture (Single-Page Layout - Decision Maker Focus)

| Section | Description |
|---|---|
| **Hero Section (Above the fold)** | A visionary, declarative headline (e.g., “From Intent to Implementation.” or “Tell Us What You Want. Let Voder Build It.”)<br>Optional subtitle clarifying the value proposition: “Voder turns your business intent into working software—automatically.” |
| **Conceptual Teaser** | Two to three lines introducing the core idea:<br>“With Voder, you don’t write source code. You describe what your application should do. Voder compiles your intent into production-ready code.” |
| **Metaphor Section** | Business-focused metaphor:<br>“Most AI coding tools are like giving directions from the passenger seat: ‘Turn left here’, ‘Go right at the lights’. Voder is different. It’s like setting a destination in GPS. You define where you want to go. Voder plans the route and drives you there.” |
| **Problem Framing (Business Pain Point)** | Focus on delivery bottlenecks:<br>“Today, teams spend too much time translating business intent into technical implementation. Voder reduces time-to-market and ensures product outcomes stay aligned with business goals.” |
| **The Why (Philosophy Section)** | **Our Why:**<br>“We believe building software should start with intent, not syntax.<br><br>We believe that creators and problem solvers shouldn’t have to get bogged down in implementation details just to bring their ideas to life.<br><br>Your time is better spent defining behaviour, outcomes, and user experience—not wrangling with frameworks, languages, or boilerplate.<br><br>Where others give you faster ways to write code, Voder gives you a better way to describe w...
| **Visual Element** | A conceptual diagram showing business vision flowing through Voder into a working application:<br>“Business Intent → Source Prompts → Voder → Working Software” |
| **Footer** | Minimal. Contains:<br>- “Voder. 2025.”<br>- Copyright |
| **(Optional Future Section Placeholder)** | If needed in future: Light "About" or "Vision Roadmap" section. For now, keep excluded. |
